why not save in async?
00:19:52	Raúl Kripalani:	Should be fine to attest and store async
00:20:07	Raúl Kripalani:	Attestation duty != custody duty
00:20:33	Pawan Dhananjay:	Haven’t heard any attestation degradation reports on LH. But I doubt any of our users don’t use decently fast ssds
00:20:36	Łukasz Rozmej:	if you validated it you DO want to be async
00:20:41	Dustin:	It's more that until the columns are processed, the block isn't valid
00:21:31	Cayman Nava:	Reacted to "It's more that until..." with 👍
00:23:00	Manu:	It’s more than serving.
What about if you attest for a block and save columns async, and the client has a bug preventing it to save columns into disk?

In this case, the data is unavailable, while we voted for the given block
00:23:20	Dustin:	then you don't have them
00:23:27	Manu:	Reacted to "then you don't have ..." with 👍
00:23:27	Dustin:	until they have been persisted
00:23:48	Satyajit:	Reacted to "It’s more than se..." with 👍
00:24:00	Manu:	Exactly. That’s why IMO we should not declare these columns as available before clearly persisting them to storage
00:24:18	Manu:	(And so, declare the block as available, and vote for this block)

00:34:32	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think at this point it is likely too late to revisit the decision, at some point it needs to be final.

I will say though, as a point of criticism of the EIP champions, given how important a headliner is, I found remarkably little willingness to consider adjustments earlier into the process. That was a failure in my opinion.
00:34:52	nflaig:	if we wanna ship the fork fast I think we should split it out into H* and also allow more feedback on the design, if we wanna ship in Glamsterdam we should consider all feedback and take into account that shipping the fork might take longer

At least a few weeks from today, given the holidays. There are some things we’d like to explore like staked builders without validator duties so they can make faster deposits. But I would consider these to be optimizations/improvements.

00:41:41	Quintus Kilbourn:	Taking away the 32 eth minimum and allowing deposits to go faster keep capital requirements down which is good for keeping the market easy to participate in

The only other major thing to say is that we really should do as much as possible to avoid using p2p for bidding (great for WW3 but undesirable for everything else)
00:41:42	Francesco:	I am sure we’ll sort it out eventually, just doesn’t seem like a small thing
00:41:50	Potuz:	Replying to "In Fusaka we spent ~..."

My general take on these things is to by default not change things like this big when they are already in motion, but at least we want to be exploring how bad of a change it would be
00:41:59	Potuz:	Replying to "In Fusaka we spent ~..."

It could be this fork or the next one to iterate over this
00:42:00	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "In Fusaka we spent ~..."

I think we want to have a decentralized set of p2p bids, they aren’t really a problem for the proposer cause they’ll get just a few of them already heavily filtered

00:45:47	gd:	I think as long as there is an alternative path to validators p2p is fine. p2p becomes a bit more of a concern if it is the only option to reach a large enough portion of the stake

 Which is reasonable, imo. ePBS and BALs are both big features and we shouldn't do 3 big features in one fork.
00:48:26	nixo:	it’s not ‘process for the sake of process’ - client teams have indicated support for focil in glamsterdam but the rest of the ecosystem hasn’t really had the opportunity. they need a ‘process’ to know how to participate

00:49:44	Francesco:	Replying to "I think at this poin..."

Two things are true imo:
Potuz (and Terence and others) did a great job at engaging with all kinds of stakeholders repeatedly, over a long period of time.
Earlier in the decision process, the discussion became more charged than it should have been because people felt that trustless payments would either get in now (on the wave of epbs’ scalability features) or never (similar dynamics to FOCIL). People saying that trustless payments could be split from the other features and raising concerns around complexity were ignored or treated as lacking Ethereum values
00:50:04	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I personally would be open to FOCIL sfi now - but I don’t think it would be appropriate to assign it headliner status before starting the headliner process. That would be unfair to other potential headliner proposals.

In practice ofc good chance we then decide there is no room for a(nother) CL headliner, but that should be during a proper headliner scoping process.
00:50:23	alex (ultra sound):	Reacted to "Two things are true ..." with 👀

(And to be clear I am not saying that this was all on Potuz or someone, it’s partially just the governance dynamics that can turn unhealthy when something is contentious)
00:51:18	Potuz:	FWIW, that paper doesn’t talk about FOCIL but MCP

It’s less of a bending of process to change that than to decide to skip an entire headliner process
00:52:53	Toni Wahrstätter:	Feels like the majority agrees that focil has merits. 
This doesn't change the fact that glamsterdam is already big and that we should stick to the process to give other eips the same chance as focil in heka.

The process is a few months old, so not exactly sacred, and at the end of the day the process serves Ethereum goals, not itself. Still, SFIng something before the headliner process makes the headliner process fairly meaningless

 We should also involve rollups in the discussion who will not get CR from focil, or at least flag it publicly that blobs won't be supported.
Same for starks that are too big to fit into ILs.

As a person who has built the 6s prototype, I don't think we understand 6s's technical impact as much as FOCIL. Unlike FOCIL, 6s has the nature that we should analyze 2nd and 3rd order impact similar to EIP-7549. Having running prototype that is running in a "local" environment doesn't really tell us much on its technical impact.

01:27:30	Greg K |Lido:	I had the impression that Prysm supports 7688 (see ACDC - NOv 13th): https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1790#issuecomment-3524246616

01:31:04	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Fidelity?
01:31:34	kingy_sigp:	lighthouse supports 8080
01:31:52	Dustin:	sure, 8080 is fine
01:32:09	Barnabas:	is any CL team against CFI 8080?
01:32:42	Potuz:	We support it if people agree with the WSP decrease safety assumptions.
01:32:55	saulius:	Replying to "Grandine suggests to..."

devnet-2 works too :)
01:32:56	kingy_sigp:	At this time we don't support 8061 as adjustments to consensus code are non-trivial. If there are specific advantages people want from 8061 we would want to see them because at the moment it doesn't seem worth it to us.
01:33:06	Francesco:	It doesn’t come from anywhere, it’s a magic number like the previous number 😅 I don’t know about this fidelity thing though
01:33:08	Cayman Nava:	I had thought that the existing ws period at 2 weeks mirrors our "worst case" timeline for coordinating around bad network conditions
01:33:17	Potuz:	Reacted to "It doesn’t come from..." with 🤣
01:33:25	Francesco:	To be clear I wrote the EIP, without input from fidelity or whoever
01:33:33	NC:	Regarding shorter WS period, we should ask the broader community because they run the nodes and whether 7 days is enough for them
01:33:42	saulius:	Replying to "Grandine suggests to..."

I just want to get all the clients interoping on devnet-1 with epbs first.
01:34:12	stokes:	Replying to "To be clear I wrote ..."

Yes, im just calling attention to this comment

01:34:33	Potuz:	Reacted to "I think we should CF..." with 👍
01:34:36	Dustin:	Replying to "To be clear I wrot..."

Right, I'm not saying Fidelity was involved in writing the EIP
01:34:38	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should CF..."

I agree

IIRC, it also mirrored around how long we kept blobs around for as well.
01:34:46	Francesco:	Replying to "To be clear I wrote ..."

Yeah just wanted to clarify
01:35:34	Francesco:	The main advantage is not having a 40 day withdrawal queue 😄 In combination with 8080, it would be like 5 days or something
01:35:42	Francesco:	Replying to "The main advantage i..."

(With current amount of eth in the queue)
01:35:59	Justin Traglia:	Reacted to "I think we should CF..." with 👍
01:36:49	Francesco:	Also consider that the benefits are actually greater for home stakers or anyway stakers other than LSTs and staking pools, because the in-protocol exits is all they have
01:37:11	Barnabas:	SFI is when we we have them on devnets
01:37:18	Barnabas:	thats probably still at least a month away
01:37:29	Francesco:	Reacted to "I think we should CF..." with 👍
01:38:02	Potuz:	Reacted to "IIRC, it also mirror..." with 👍
01:38:11	Potuz:	Replying to "I had thought that t..."

But that was the other way around
01:38:17	Potuz:	Replying to "I had thought that t..."

We chose the blob retention period because of that
01:38:22	Francesco:	Replying to "I think we should CF..."

I would support this, and I am very much open to more conservative values. Just we have to be mindful that it doesn’t make sense to do the EIP if we don’t decrease the WSP meaningfully (like at least to 12 days or 10 days or something)
01:38:44	Barnabas:	2048 epochs sounds pretty good to me (9d)
01:39:00	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should CF..."

I looked into the implementation and it seems simple enough to justify implementation to at least have some testing already done
01:39:09	Cayman Nava:	Reacted to "I think we should CF..." with 👍
01:39:19	Phil Ngo:	Reacted to "We chose the blob re..." with 👍
01:39:19	Francesco:	Replying to "I had thought that t..."

Yeah the WSP existed from the beginning, before blobs. Unfortunately I wasn’t around back then and from the documents I read I can’t find a clear motivation for 15 days other than it being a somewhat meaningful social coordination period
01:39:23	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should CF..."

Doubt we’ll get much bikeshedding against a week for WSP unless some real P0 appears
01:39:27	Barnabas:	Time to get to work!
