00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:44.550
stokes: Hello!

2
00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.280
stokes: Stan care?

3
00:15:52.810 --> 00:15:56.139
stokes: Let's give it, like, another minute, and we'll get started.

4
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.939
stokes: Okay, Josh, if you're helping with the stream, I think we're good to go.

5
00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.009
Josh Davis: Alright, Alex, you're good.

6
00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.309
stokes: Thank you. Okay. Hey, everyone.

7
00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.170
stokes: Welcome to ACDC, this is call number 171.

8
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:07.950
stokes: It is issue 1825 in the PM repo. There's the agenda in the chat.

9
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.400
stokes: And, yeah, I think it'll be…

10
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:15.759
stokes: Well, there's a lot on the agenda here, so yeah, let's go ahead and get into it. So…

11
00:17:16.730 --> 00:17:22.320
stokes: First up, Fusaka. So, as we all know, we had Mainnet just recently.

12
00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:30.159
stokes: And… went pretty well. There's at least one issue with PRISM. I think they're working on a post-mortem for that.

13
00:17:30.610 --> 00:17:36.679
stokes: Yeah, and then this week we had BP01, which, again, seemed to have gone pretty well.

14
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:40.309
stokes: Would anyone like to add anything for either of those two events?

15
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:47.320
stokes: I know for the post-mortem, I think prison might still be working on it.

16
00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:58.539
Barnabas: Yeah, so, BP01 looked very good. That was happening earlier this week. We did a quick,

17
00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:13.469
Barnabas: blob spamming test as well, just yesterday. We were able to do 15, blob transactions in 28 consecutive slots, and the network, didn't seem to mind it at all, so that's good.

18
00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:16.580
stokes: Okay, great.

19
00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:35.629
James He: For Prism, I guess we've recently released, two new releases. One release that's just a hotfix, so that you don't need the flag anymore, and then, we had another release with,

20
00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:42.080
James He: Semi-super node, feature and a backfill feature.

21
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:47.989
James He: There's still a couple other things we're still investigating, but,

22
00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:50.480
James He: Just wanted to call that out.

23
00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:58.710
stokes: Yeah, great. And that was, like, 701 for the patch, and then… Was there a 710?

24
00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:00.570
James He: Yeah.

25
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:02.150
stokes: Okay.

26
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.200
stokes: Thanks.

27
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:04.370
stokes: Potus?

28
00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:17.810
Potuz: Yeah, we've noticed something that, perhaps is affecting other clients as well. We, we had some users reporting, like, a bad degradation on attestation performance, and it boiled down to disk.

29
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:25.850
Potuz: We… we aren't, calling… attesting on a block until we saved all of the column sidecars.

30
00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:31.880
Potuz: And it turns out that some nodes that had moved, database to slower disks

31
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:49.240
Potuz: are now… were performing perfectly fine before Fulu are now performing badly because of this. So, it might be a general thing, we are looking into how to optimize this, but, but yeah, so we're urging our users to move to NV, to faster disks, just because of this.

32
00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.729
stokes: And you think it's because of the blobs, or something else?

33
00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:21.740
Potuz: Well, I think it's just this thing of, like, attesting while we are storing. Just replying to Raul, it's… it's a dangerous, it's a trade-off. If you… if you fail storing, then you need to go back and do something about it, because otherwise you'll be on an async situation where your database is telling you that that block was available, but then you don't really have the columns that you need to adjust for.

34
00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.690
Potuz: So I think it's… yeah, it's these kind of situations where you don't want to be a sink.

35
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:40.780
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, remind me, did we have in a… do we signal the head slot, the latest slot that we have custody for, in the metadata message, or the status message?

36
00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:47.519
Raúl Kripalani: Because if we do, then you could just not update that until it's written to disk. So you wouldn't be expressing that you have custody yet.

37
00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:54.730
Potuz: Well, the problem is, what happens if you get the child? And then, you'd be syncing a block.

38
00:20:55.870 --> 00:21:02.489
Potuz: For which you've said that the parent was available, and now you don't have the columns to even serve them.

39
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:04.470
Raúl Kripalani: Mmm.

40
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:15.459
Raúl Kripalani: Okay, I suggest we take this offline. There's a thread, I think, already in Discord, so we can continue there, and we can dig deeper. I do think there's some trade-off that we can, like, optimal trade-off that we can hit here.

41
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:20.789
Potuz: Yeah, we are… we are going to optimize this anyways, but just to flag this, that this.

42
00:21:20.790 --> 00:21:21.210
Raúl Kripalani: Hmm.

43
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:26.010
Potuz: This is affecting users that don't have fast disks, and it wasn't before.

44
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:32.890
stokes: Okay, yeah, thanks for raising that, Enrico.

45
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:47.460
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, just, comment on that. So, I think, like, we… when we are… when you are test… you're testing that you have seen things, so the sampling was okay, so I think it's theoretically

46
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:57.750
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Okay to attest while you are storing, and then it's just a problem of guaranteeing… guarantee that you can serve that?

47
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.869
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So if you are…

48
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:06.639
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): also serving via RPC, things that are in flight is okay, and then the problem is just having

49
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:18.490
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The database consistent when you start up the node, and making sure that you are filling, eventually, gaps that you are creating while stopping the node, and you haven't finished writing stuff on disk.

50
00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.790
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): that's a thing that we are dealing with.

51
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:37.950
Potuz: But even attesting is an issue, right? Because you have a separation of the validator client and the beacon node. So, by attesting, the validator client calls the beacon node, it says, what's your head?

52
00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:48.000
Potuz: So to attest to that thing, the beacon node itself must have updated the block and said, this is my head. But then to do that, the beacon node itself must have declared the block available.

53
00:22:48.090 --> 00:23:00.950
Potuz: And I think, being async here, saving your head, declaring locally on your Bitcoin node this block is available, but not having the column is… raises a dangerous… raises a danger.

54
00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:08.529
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I'm not fully agree, but I think we can… can discuss.

55
00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:12.339
stokes: Yeah, I think his point is that you do have the columns, they just went up, they persisted, right?

56
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:18.579
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I mean, it's attesting the availability, so if you've seen, it means that the data was available.

57
00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:32.430
Potuz: Yeah, but the beacon node doesn't know it's seen something. It… so we… at least we consider things seen, like a block. Have I seen this block? Yes. If I have it in DB, I have seen it. I don't… I don't act on anything that I have not stored.

58
00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:41.430
Potuz: Otherwise, I might end up in a situation in which my DB and my view of the chain is inconsistent, and this leads to bad bugs.

59
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.529
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But again, custody, to me, is different by sampling.

60
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:57.950
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So… That's the… that's the main point why I'm saying that it's okay.

61
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:09.799
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, I think… I think that perhaps the difficulty here is that the status message, does not separate between the custody head and the chain head.

62
00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:12.090
Raúl Kripalani: So, there's just a head slot.

63
00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:30.340
Raúl Kripalani: So then, when you are externalizing that you have a particular slot that you consider head, any client would be entitled to ask you for the custody columns for that head. Which, in this case, you might not be able to serve if you haven't stored them in disk, and the client is not able to pick that… serve them from the buffer.

64
00:24:30.980 --> 00:24:34.470
Raúl Kripalani: Which I think might be the solution here. Just, like, save them in the buffer.

65
00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:40.870
Raúl Kripalani: But anyway, we can take it offline, because I think we're getting into implementation details now, but…

66
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:42.359
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, I just wanted to say.

67
00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:42.970
Dustin: I…

68
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:49.069
Dustin: I, I, I, I will say one, I agree, fine, take it off, find these are not implementation details.

69
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:54.419
Dustin: And I think that there's a lot of temptation to take these shortcuts that are not

70
00:24:55.750 --> 00:25:04.060
Dustin: I mean, I… how do I say this? Without opening, you know, cans of worms here, but… which are dubiously valid, let's say. Debatably valid.

71
00:25:04.770 --> 00:25:06.760
Dustin: It is not that easy.

72
00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:16.750
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think we might disagree on what's a shortcut and what's not. But yeah, Rol, you mentioned there was a thread somewhere in Discord, so…

73
00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.319
stokes: Yeah, let's just move this somewhere else.

74
00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:23.880
stokes: Okay.

75
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:32.130
stokes: Anything else on Fusaka? Otherwise, there's one more thing on the agenda.

76
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.039
stokes: But otherwise, yeah, then, you know, it may not be PO1.

77
00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:43.870
stokes: Looks like they went well. This issue that we had just now… Anything else?

78
00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:48.170
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Just…

79
00:25:48.170 --> 00:25:48.640
stokes: Okay.

80
00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.890
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): One thing, yeah, we have, we have…

81
00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:55.699
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Several, things that we will improve.

82
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.270
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): You know, coming release.

83
00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:07.480
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Some bugs here and there, so some… some of the clients using Tegu is… is not… is…

84
00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.860
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Giving us some feedback, and we are improving.

85
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.279
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): several things, so hopefully we will have something.

86
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:20.559
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): by… this week on, Nishan, starting next week.

87
00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.439
stokes: Okay, great. And this is around, like, new things in Fishaka with.

88
00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:34.220
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, yeah, definitely. Stuff related to Fusaka, custody, and sinking, and so on.

89
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.520
stokes: Okay.

90
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:36.400
stokes: Great.

91
00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:39.269
stokes: Thank you for the update.

92
00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:50.349
stokes: Okay, then, the last thing here on the agenda for Fusaka is a bit of a bridge item, which is a retrospective process.

93
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:53.740
stokes: Let me grab the link really quickly.

94
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:55.959
stokes: Should be this one.

95
00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:57.740
stokes: So…

96
00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:06.200
stokes: Yeah, we did this starting with Pectra, and, you know, the context there was Pectra was, like, a pretty rocky fork.

97
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:07.550
stokes: So…

98
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:14.399
stokes: You know, we had the idea to do, essentially, a retrospective on, yeah, kind of the fork and the upgrade process generally.

99
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.839
stokes: Now that Fusaka is generally out the door, it makes sense to go ahead and do this again.

100
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.230
stokes: So, Nixon made this Ethan Magicians post here.

101
00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:37.299
stokes: And the idea is for the next few weeks, just to have this open. Yeah, if anyone would like to provide feedback, this is a great place to do so. And yeah, this helps just refine how we do everything.

102
00:27:38.210 --> 00:27:38.980
stokes: Yeah.

103
00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:40.569
stokes: So, take a look.

104
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:50.229
stokes: And, essentially, the idea would be, this phase of the process would go until, we start ACD in the next… in the new year.

105
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.560
stokes: Which is, yeah, something like 3 weeks from now, so…

106
00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:57.399
stokes: Take a look, you know, reflect, and…

107
00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.039
stokes: And add your feedback there, when you have a minute.

108
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:04.260
stokes: Okay.

109
00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:09.040
stokes: Anything else on Fusaka? Otherwise, we'll move forward into the future.

110
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:15.830
stokes: Okay.

111
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:17.469
stokes: So let's go…

112
00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:25.540
stokes: And we had a few things here. So, one, there was this conversation about justice payments in EPVS,

113
00:28:26.010 --> 00:28:27.660
stokes: We should talk about that.

114
00:28:28.300 --> 00:28:38.000
stokes: Otherwise, the intent was to finish scoping for Amsterdam. We had a few open questions on some of the EIPs, that we'll get to.

115
00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:42.839
stokes: In this section, so… To kick us off with trustless payments.

116
00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:48.979
stokes: Let me just kind of replay, you know, at least my understanding of the frame here, so…

117
00:28:49.510 --> 00:28:53.110
stokes: You know, we had this part of the EIP,

118
00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:57.349
stokes: And it was selected in full as a headliner, you know.

119
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.020
stokes: A long time ago at this point.

120
00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:12.609
stokes: We've had this conversation a couple times in ACDC of justice payments, and, you know, how the feature works, and, you know, should it be taken out, should it be split, different options here, should we leave it as is?

121
00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.410
stokes: A few weeks ago, there was definitely some…

122
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:27.690
stokes: you know, input from the community here, in particular some of the existing builders and relays, and different people in the MEV ecosystem, who, you know, this would definitely impact.

123
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.600
stokes: They had some concerns around the design here.

124
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:37.410
stokes: So, they brought this to, I think it was 2 or 3 ACDCs ago,

125
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:40.289
stokes: In the meantime, we had a breakout.

126
00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:45.010
stokes: Where, you know, I think we continued the conversation, and… yeah.

127
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:54.109
stokes: The point of all this, or at least, yeah, again, given the narrative, how we got to today, we should make a call on what to do with this.

128
00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.410
stokes: So… yeah.

129
00:29:56.710 --> 00:30:04.130
stokes: I'm happy to open the floor for comments. I can sort of play back my summary of where I think things are at.

130
00:30:04.610 --> 00:30:07.680
stokes: Unless someone would like to add… their takes.

131
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:17.519
stokes: Okay. So, from what I've seen…

132
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.699
stokes: You know, what we had said, again, a few different calls ago, we basically would, you know, have trustless payments as is.

133
00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:27.789
stokes: Unless there was some security issue.

134
00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:31.450
stokes: And… yeah, again, I think this is…

135
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:37.589
stokes: Yeah, there are many different opinions here on what we should do. From what I've seen…

136
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:44.460
stokes: There have not been any arguments to the point that trustless payments are, like, actually negative or bad for the protocol?

137
00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:53.410
stokes: There are some arguments that might suggest they're not being used, or, like, wouldn't be used, but then we have to take into account the fact of what we gain.

138
00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:56.269
stokes: And what we gain is essentially this fallback for…

139
00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:04.329
stokes: you know, what might be retail scenarios, but again, keeping in mind Ethereum's values and, like, what we're trying to do here in aggregate.

140
00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.970
stokes: We can definitely make the argument that this is important, and that we should do it now.

141
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.249
stokes: So… I think that's essentially where we're at. We keep it as is.

142
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:21.699
stokes: in terms of what might start to be a compromise, you know, I think there's been some work around finding ways to…

143
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:36.100
stokes: allow the status quo of the MEV ecosystem to exist in this world. So at least that's something I would want to ask today, and or something I would, you know, want to keep working with the authors of EIP on.

144
00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:52.029
stokes: is finding a way to make sure this is supported with, like, minimal disruption. Again, you know, I think in particular, having, relays be staked is… is an ask. I don't think it's a huge ask, and I think that's kind of the main difference. Otherwise.

145
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.879
stokes: You know, today's players can kind of live in the status quo.

146
00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:57.050
stokes: So…

147
00:31:57.890 --> 00:32:04.180
stokes: That's where I'm at. Again, I don't know if there are any other comments or perspectives we should raise.

148
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:18.619
alex (ultra sound): Maybe, like, just very shortly, wanted to speak some appreciation for everybody in… for engaging in the discussion.

149
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:23.310
alex (ultra sound): Maybe one very small meta point?

150
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:32.200
alex (ultra sound): just… that I've noticed, because I've spoken to a lot of people now about this, and I've noticed that on, regardless of what people's positions or opinions were, they…

151
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:36.430
alex (ultra sound): We're sometimes pretty worn out by the discussion.

152
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:52.139
alex (ultra sound): I think sometimes when you work on a really hard problem, that makes a lot of sense, right? Stuff is just hard, rest, support each other, and continue. But I feel like when it's… the resistance is more, like, people against each other, than maybe in general for the EIP process or future changes.

153
00:32:52.400 --> 00:33:06.740
alex (ultra sound): I could imagine, this is very much my personal opinion, that slowing down might be very healthy to, right, work through some of these things, but again, I'll immediately say that I feel like a lot of people have really done their best to try and do precisely, that.

154
00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.109
alex (ultra sound): So, thank you.

155
00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:17.740
stokes: Yeah, thank you. Yeah, you definitely have been helping coordinate, you know, this investigation that

156
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:30.719
stokes: we've just had, which, again, I'm… I mean that in, like, a very positive light. We are going to get to the best divine by having the most people look at this and poke, you know, from every possible angle and corner, so…

157
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.280
stokes: Yeah, thank you for that.

158
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:42.390
stokes: And… okay, so… Again, I think then where we're at, we keep the EAP as is.

159
00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:51.430
stokes: there's, I think, some questions around, you know, from here, details around how these different components should fit together, and again, I think we should…

160
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:57.929
stokes: Make sure that there's a way, again, that, you know, the current ecosystem will not be completely disrupted.

161
00:33:58.050 --> 00:34:04.909
stokes: My understanding is that this is already the case. But yeah, let's just make sure that we can kind of…

162
00:34:05.150 --> 00:34:07.590
stokes: Keep that in mind as we move forward with the design.

163
00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:14.329
stokes: So… Any final comments on this?

164
00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:22.629
stokes: I would say for the record, like, yeah, this is, I think, at least the second time we've kind of formally considered this.

165
00:34:23.190 --> 00:34:28.370
stokes: And again, the takeaway is we're keeping them in.

166
00:34:28.489 --> 00:34:32.619
stokes: I do feel at this point, we've done the work to hear as many people out as we can.

167
00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:45.859
stokes: And… yeah, again, the only, you know, consideration, or the only point at which we'd want to revisit this is if there were, like, very, very clear security issues, which, again, no one seems to be able to find, so…

168
00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.210
stokes: Any closing comments on that?

169
00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.980
stokes: Before we go to the next topic.

170
00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.910
stokes: Okay.

171
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.759
stokes: I don't know, there's some comments in the chat, but I think people should speak up if they want.

172
00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.229
stokes: Yeah, Oscar.

173
00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:27.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, not at all to disagree with that decision. I think that's actually my decision, but, just maybe as a general comment, I do think

174
00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:45.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: for many reasons, some of them definitely, I think, also triggered by some kind of behavior from the EF research side, but I do think, looking back at the history of the EFP and the governance process around it and whatnot, I feel like it relatively early on turned unnecessarily adversarial, and I think

175
00:35:46.020 --> 00:36:00.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: it turned very much into a my proposal, your proposal kind of situation. I think there were several kind of, like, smaller adjustment ideas that then ended up never being really considered, given that it was like, oh, this is yet another attempt to basically subvert

176
00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:11.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: like, one side winning or something, I don't know. Maybe this is purely my perspective, this could be, and then… my apologies for bringing this up. I just do feel like, once we have a retrospective, maybe for

177
00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:23.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: the EPBS inclusion process, I do think we could have done more as a group. Again, not even, I think, in chat, I actually worded it a bit as inclusive as the champions, that was probably immature, I think more as a group as a whole, including from our side.

178
00:36:23.930 --> 00:36:35.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think we could have done more to keep it focused on the technical questions, and I think there could have been more collaboration on, yes, let's move forward with EPBS, but also early on into the process, let's take some more time actually

179
00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:43.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: working on potential iterations. So I do think there was something that didn't went well. I understand why the community now reacted the way

180
00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: They did, but by now, I think we have a good headliner, maybe not perfect, but yeah.

181
00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.310
stokes: Thank you.

182
00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.059
stokes: There's a good question here.

183
00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:08.720
stokes: from Francesco, I think we should address. So, yeah, again, I think, in part, to try to find, like, a nice middle ground between, again, kind of the status quo and what this EIP would introduce.

184
00:37:08.850 --> 00:37:18.210
stokes: There are some proposals to modify parts of trustless payments, and I do think we should sort out, yeah, how we're going to resolve those.

185
00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:28.609
stokes: You know, I think my sort of straw man would be what Justin's saying here in the chat, like, something like mid of January, we should say, like, pencils up on spec changes.

186
00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.300
stokes: Potu's here. You said these are big changes. I don't know if you want to speak more to that.

187
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:52.739
Potuz: Oh, they aren't so big in principle, but they… so I guess the biggest concern here is that, for historical reasons, perhaps, this goes back to, like, 2 years ago, and discussions with Mike Neuter, actually, and the builders at that time.

188
00:37:53.130 --> 00:38:10.880
Potuz: mentioned that, yes, they would… if they are going to be state, they would rather not be losing capital and then be earning rewards. But it turns out that now, when they are faced with the churn and deposit churn, they, they…

189
00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:20.200
Potuz: said that they are… they seem to be aligned that they would rather forfeit the rewards, not be validators, keep the stake without getting rewards.

190
00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:26.369
Potuz: And, and yes, and just take… take that as the… as the… Payment for bids.

191
00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:43.450
Potuz: The problem of doing this, like, removing the builders from the validator slides, is that it also removes the ability for validators to submit bids. I'm not sure if this is a trade-off that we're willing to make, because this was the feature that allowed us to remove the self-building property.

192
00:38:43.770 --> 00:38:52.270
Potuz: We were hoping that this set of validators would still be decentralized enough, that we can just remove the self-building requirement. Anyways, there's a bunch of discussion to do about this.

193
00:38:52.430 --> 00:39:00.470
Potuz: I believe that we can actually implement these changes. I think this is an honest request from builders to avoid the churn.

194
00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.249
stokes: Right, and so to be clear, this is taking away the validator duties of the Xerox3 validators?

195
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:19.880
Potuz: Right, so it would be taking away the validator duties, and in this way, we can allow them to deposit faster. They still would need to go over a long term to withdraw, otherwise this is a DOS.

196
00:39:20.110 --> 00:39:38.640
Potuz: But it will allow them to deposit and get included quickly, because it wouldn't even affect a week's substitutivity period or anything. So it's easier… it makes the protocol easier to reason about. There's many reasons why you would want to have something like this. You could also, in principle, include builders that are only staked for one ETH, or minimally.

197
00:39:39.220 --> 00:39:43.300
Potuz: And then they would be able to bid for this match.

198
00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:54.469
Potuz: But, yeah, so, I think for me, the biggest loss of such a system would be the fact that we lose this very nice feature, which is validators are able to submit bids.

199
00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:00.970
stokes: Okay.

200
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:06.309
stokes: So, I think in terms of moving forward, you know, I think getting clarity here.

201
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.320
stokes: Base up, is what we should do.

202
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:18.749
stokes: Yeah, I assume there are still EPBS breakouts. Like, I think this is something we should be covering on the breakouts until we get to some resolution.

203
00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:23.640
stokes: Yeah.

204
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:29.459
stokes: Like, I think it's a little premature to be like, okay, you know, by January 15th, like, pencil's up.

205
00:40:29.830 --> 00:40:37.149
stokes: But if anything, that's, like, a target I think we should keep in mind, and sort this out as soon as possible.

206
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:42.060
stokes: You know, one way to de-risk this moving forward is just…

207
00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:49.790
stokes: Yeah, I mean, again, we have history here, but if we can get to a place where we do the more permissive thing first.

208
00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:56.050
stokes: To add, you know, essentially more restrictive things later, we should do that.

209
00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.300
stokes: Oh, let me rephrase that one.

210
00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:04.679
stokes: What I mean is, like, you know, if we can do something such that it's, like, more future… like, more forward compatible later, we should do that.

211
00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:10.300
stokes: In the event that, say, we want to ship and, like, do these iterations down the line.

212
00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:21.870
stokes: Okay. Yeah, Francesco's saying here in chat that he's worried we might not be able to sort this out.

213
00:41:23.490 --> 00:41:25.309
stokes: Yeah.

214
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:38.299
stokes: I think it's worth at least, yeah, taking another breakout call to really investigate this in earnest. It sounds like we have an idea. Like, is it really just this one idea?

215
00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:41.989
stokes: Of having non-validating stick builders.

216
00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:03.810
stokes: Okay, I mean, that sounds like it… what… it sounds like the situation to me, so…

217
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:18.320
stokes: Let's keep moving forward on that. This should be the topic of the next breakout, and yeah, let's try to assess there how this looks like in terms of, yeah, any additional changes, and what that means for… what that might mean for…

218
00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:19.879
stokes: I'm meaning things.

219
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:22.540
stokes: Okay.

220
00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:26.810
stokes: Any other comments on trustless payments for the moment?

221
00:42:38.750 --> 00:42:39.600
stokes: Okay.

222
00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:49.810
stokes: So… That's that. And… okay, next up, would be doing the non-headliner EIP scoping.

223
00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.950
stokes: So… okay.

224
00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.969
stokes: We have a number of VIPs to touch on to round out the Glamster Dam scope.

225
00:42:57.460 --> 00:43:06.349
stokes: One of them is the question of fossil that we had. There were questions then around 7688.

226
00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:09.340
stokes: 8061 and 8080.

227
00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:13.409
stokes: And I think those were the last ones on the CL side that we needed to get through.

228
00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.050
stokes: So… Let's go ahead and touch on Fossil.

229
00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:25.349
stokes: So… yeah, again, this is also, you know, I think there's been some history here with this EIP.

230
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:32.450
stokes: What we had said, you know, the process for this.

231
00:43:32.620 --> 00:43:38.460
stokes: was that, you know, there were concerns around Scoping and Glamsterdam, And…

232
00:43:38.730 --> 00:43:45.070
stokes: And because of that, you know, we wanted to think about putting it into a feature fork, say HECA,

233
00:43:45.740 --> 00:43:52.330
stokes: As part of that, you know, it'd be nice to have some credible way to commit to HECA, or commit to Fossil and HECA.

234
00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:55.679
stokes: And I feel like we tried this on the last call.

235
00:43:55.810 --> 00:43:58.400
stokes: I think there was already confusion.

236
00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:03.880
stokes: around, you know, should we do CFI, should we do SFI, and how that should work?

237
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:17.890
stokes: So, that all being said, you know, as of the last ACDC, the points were made, you know, hey, we essentially shouldn't get just, like, you know, different client team members' opinions just in time.

238
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:25.249
stokes: we should also reach out to the execution layer. So yeah, so we took this to ACDE last week.

239
00:44:25.420 --> 00:44:30.460
stokes: And I think, again, people are generally supportive of including this in some fashion.

240
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.789
stokes: And I think that essentially brings us to today.

241
00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:43.200
stokes: So, you know, I think following that arc, you know, I'm willing to have a conversation if people want to try to think about scheduling

242
00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:46.380
stokes: Fossil in some form or fashion, ECA.

243
00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:53.720
stokes: But… I will also say at the same time, having thought about this some more, I think…

244
00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:59.500
stokes: What will happen is it will be tricky to say, hey, you know, we should ignore the process.

245
00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:05.499
stokes: Process being just opening up the headliners, for HECA and moving forward that way.

246
00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:09.380
stokes: So, you know, if people want to…

247
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:16.089
stokes: Essentially, yeah, raise points for one way or the other, you know, we should do that now.

248
00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:26.780
stokes: I do think right now my recommendation is just to say, hey, you know, we tried this, it's going to be hard to get consensus, I think especially given the fact that

249
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:33.850
stokes: If we do want to deviate from the process, it should be, I think, fairly uniform that this is what we want to do.

250
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:40.609
stokes: I think already some people have called out that we should not ignore the process that we have laid out with headliner selection, etc.

251
00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:46.870
stokes: So that would mean going to the headliner process for HECA, with this question of fossil.

252
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:58.250
stokes: one quick side note, and then I'll stop talking. Given that we just finished up Fusaka, this is… essentially, now is the time to think about headliners.

253
00:45:58.910 --> 00:46:04.350
stokes: for ECA, which I'm gonna touch on this after we finish this EIP scoping for Amsterdam.

254
00:46:04.690 --> 00:46:12.780
stokes: But, yeah. Point being, we would start the headliner selection process for HECA, essentially, you know, start of next year, so in just a few weeks.

255
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:16.360
stokes: Okay.

256
00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.680
stokes: Yeah.

257
00:46:19.230 --> 00:46:20.170
stokes: So I spoke.

258
00:46:21.460 --> 00:46:29.750
soispoke: Yeah, thanks, that was, yeah, I think that was a good recap. I mean, my opinion is that we should…

259
00:46:30.190 --> 00:46:34.229
soispoke: It would be quite healthy to stop, like, moving the goalpost, and…

260
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:48.230
soispoke: And we keep asking clients what they think, and they keep basically saying that they are in favor of included, but then we keep moving anyways. And I also just want to add that

261
00:46:48.440 --> 00:47:01.760
soispoke: We are, again, like, in a situation in which most of the pushback on Forsole is about process. It was already the case for Glamsterdam, and now we are basically repeating the exact same pattern for H-star.

262
00:47:02.170 --> 00:47:15.690
soispoke: I actually think it maybe echoes… well, I don't want to take his word, but, like, what Anzaga was saying was, like, decisions being made on technical merits of an EAP of a feature, rather than just, like.

263
00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:21.360
soispoke: Focusing on, on the process, and…

264
00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:38.599
soispoke: Yeah, I feel like, at some point, like, if, you know, if people have, like, strong technical reasons to be concerned, but also, or they actually don't support it, like, they should voice it, but it's not been the case for a while, and I do think there is, like, a sort of limit

265
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:46.180
soispoke: To allowing… allow… allowing, sort of, like, veto power if the pushback from,

266
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.630
soispoke: people that don't want to see fossil in is just about process.

267
00:47:51.830 --> 00:47:58.480
soispoke: Yeah, the last point is, you know, I think I said that on ACD a bit, but…

268
00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:06.799
soispoke: continuously having, client teams sort of, like, have to come up with opinions, about an IP.

269
00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:23.240
soispoke: That means they need to have the actual discussions, they need to come together, come back with an opinion over and over again, and I think, like, it's quite wasteful in terms of time if we actually don't end up considering these opinions, so I just want…

270
00:48:23.370 --> 00:48:25.540
soispoke: Maybe people to be mindful of.

271
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:29.510
soispoke: Yeah, draining this process,

272
00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:43.479
soispoke: longer, which is why I would favor, like, actually coming to a decision, around fossil inclusion, just because it's been very long, and yeah, I will stop talking now.

273
00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.550
stokes: Yeah, thanks.

274
00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:50.840
stokes: Okay, yeah, Tano, and then maybe I can respond to Tama.

275
00:48:51.550 --> 00:49:01.449
donnoh | L2BEAT: Yeah, so… I've been asked to express my opinion on the topic, so I spent a lot of time,

276
00:49:01.590 --> 00:49:05.660
donnoh | L2BEAT: like, talking with L2s, because, you know, that's what I do at AltoBeat.

277
00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:14.700
donnoh | L2BEAT: And Osil came out, a few times as a way to reduce the challenge period, which is something that, a lot of protocols want.

278
00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.930
donnoh | L2BEAT: But, you know, even apart from this.

279
00:49:18.060 --> 00:49:20.959
donnoh | L2BEAT: The two things I want to say is…

280
00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:28.280
donnoh | L2BEAT: One of the reasons I think the conversation around fossil has been frustrating a little bit,

281
00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:35.200
donnoh | L2BEAT: both people, you know, pro-folsale or against fossil is because I don't think we're, we're…

282
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:38.339
donnoh | L2BEAT: Like, discussing it, the proper way.

283
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:47.949
donnoh | L2BEAT: And I think the proper way to discuss fossil is to think about timely inclusion, right? So, first of all, we need to agree that timely inclusion is valuable.

284
00:49:48.350 --> 00:50:00.190
donnoh | L2BEAT: And what I want to convince you is that it is. Like, there is a huge class of protocols that requires time and inclusion for safety. One obvious example is, you know, optimistic roll-ups with a challenge period.

285
00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:06.599
donnoh | L2BEAT: Another example is the intent protocols, that also have a challenge period for settlement.

286
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:14.300
donnoh | L2BEAT: Another example is, stuff like polymarkets. They use a 2-hour strange period to settle disputes.

287
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:27.049
donnoh | L2BEAT: Or in general, you know, upgrade delays, exit windows, you want to exit, withdraw from protocol, you need time inclusion for safety, right? But it's not just about row censorship resistance, it's also about safety of funds.

288
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:38.080
donnoh | L2BEAT: And the proper way to model inclusion is through economic attacks. I've seen very, very few attempts to discuss fossil in the lens of

289
00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.919
donnoh | L2BEAT: What is the advantage that it gives?

290
00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:53.069
donnoh | L2BEAT: to a user, if there are, an economic attack, right? So I pay a tip to close the transaction, someone else pays another tip to, right, to push out my transactions.

291
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:59.509
donnoh | L2BEAT: There is only one paper, by Offshore Labs trying to discuss these benefits of fossil.

292
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:14.720
donnoh | L2BEAT: The outcome of this paper and the result is, it seems like it gives you, one other magnitude improvement, in the sense of, if you have an attacker that has $100 billion and wants to censor you,

293
00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:26.049
donnoh | L2BEAT: in… without fossil, you need 10 times more money to try to include these transactions with fossil. I don't think the model is perfect, I think the model, needs to be improved.

294
00:51:26.410 --> 00:51:38.289
donnoh | L2BEAT: It doesn't correctly matter faucet, in my opinion, but I think this should be how the conversation would need to go forward, and that's also why I think it's valuable to have a little bit more time to discuss.

295
00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:41.040
donnoh | L2BEAT: the benefits of postal.

296
00:51:43.110 --> 00:51:44.150
stokes: Okay, thanks.

297
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:57.659
stokes: Yeah, again, just sharing my perspective, given that I talked to many of the people on this call. I don't think anyone's really debating, at least to first order, like, the technical merits of fossil. I think it, you know.

298
00:51:57.810 --> 00:51:59.000
stokes: In terms of how…

299
00:51:59.320 --> 00:52:04.759
stokes: We got to today, it's really just a question of, like, when to scope it and, you know, what process gets us there.

300
00:52:05.370 --> 00:52:19.010
stokes: And yeah, so again, you know, it was considered for Amsterdam. I think there are legitimate concerns around scope and complexity to not do that. Then the question was, you know, can we put it into the next work, especially given…

301
00:52:19.310 --> 00:52:22.550
stokes: And I think what's pretty uniform support for it.

302
00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:34.540
stokes: And then, circling back to… so I spoke, yeah, like, I agree the process has not been ideal, you know, it's been pretty rocky, and, you know, I think my answer to that today is just to say, hey.

303
00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:41.059
stokes: Let's take a step back, lean back on the process, because that's something we can all agree to. That's just, like, sort of a, you know.

304
00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:43.959
stokes: Established precedent that we have.

305
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:45.750
stokes: And…

306
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:54.970
stokes: then that would be my suggestion, is say okay. Given especially that we're starting HECA headlining just in a few weeks, this is the time to do that.

307
00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.439
stokes: Carl.

308
00:53:00.450 --> 00:53:04.129
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, I think my thing here is that it's like…

309
00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:13.699
Carl Beekhuizen: Fossil does bring many amazing benefits that I think most people here would like to see. The reason I think it's important that we still go through the process is just that we need to consider

310
00:53:14.050 --> 00:53:18.459
Carl Beekhuizen: Shipping fossil means we don't ship other things, we need to consider what are those other things, and whether

311
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.680
Carl Beekhuizen: we want to make those trade-offs in H-star, and I don't think those discussions have been had.

312
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:31.480
Carl Beekhuizen: So, for that reason, I think it's very important we go through the headliner process. I think it's very likely that we end up back at Fossil, and…

313
00:53:31.690 --> 00:53:34.400
Carl Beekhuizen: Great then, but I think it's important to do that.

314
00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:46.519
stokes: Yeah, and, you know, maybe to add to that, not just for us, but also to give the community an opportunity to weigh in.

315
00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:49.520
stokes: And… Yeah.

316
00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:57.399
stokes: There's some side chat, I don't know if anyone would like to speak up.

317
00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.879
stokes: To add an input to the conversation.

318
00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:19.079
nixo: I think… I think CFI-ing is, pretty uncontroversial at this stage, as, like, a…

319
00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:34.309
nixo: as a positive signal, SFI is… is controversial, and I think that for that reason, we should go for CFI, because if we make it SFI, there's not really any meaning in the difference between CFI and SFI. I…

320
00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.020
nixo: SFI's something as a head… as the first thing that goes in

321
00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:42.009
nixo: Essentially denotes it as the headliner.

322
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:46.959
nixo: And so I understand the desire to move it to SFI as soon as possible to

323
00:54:47.170 --> 00:54:56.510
nixo: make it the frontrunner, but it… it really should go through the process, and this, sFI-ing it to begin with makes this meaningless.

324
00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:03.230
stokes: Oscar.

325
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:10.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, while I tend to agree with Nixu, I personally also preferred to just have it,

326
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:28.199
Ansgar Dietrichs: steep aside, just given that I think Tomar had a point that we keep always asking, like, on all codefs, there's always the conversation, okay, what does… what do the codevs think? And then the codevs seem to have preferred, in the past, SFI, so I just wanted to say, if we go ahead with SFI, I personally would prefer the

327
00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: The version of that where we just say, it is SFI already.

328
00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:46.119
Ansgar Dietrichs: But we just go through the normal headliner process as usual, and in that headliner process, we will just consider, okay, we already have SMI for us, so does that mean we want to have it as the headliner? We could still decide to not have it as the headliner. I mean, as of one call ago, we were still

329
00:55:46.360 --> 00:56:02.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: considering including it into Amsterdam as a non-headliner, so there's definitely precedent for it to potentially be a non-headliner. So we could just decide that as part of the headliner process. I don't think it would be too much of a bending of the process, and I would… if there's strong demand to do SFI already today.

330
00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:10.430
Ansgar Dietrichs: I personally would prefer that over locking it in as a headliner, because that really, in a way, I think, is… is a bit of a violation of the headliner process.

331
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:19.230
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think the catch there is, like, this should be considered a headliner. Like, you know, fossil is big, putting it into the program.

332
00:56:19.550 --> 00:56:26.060
stokes: protocol will produce headlines, which is, like, you know, the intuition behind the name Headliner.

333
00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:29.029
stokes: I think it was… so I spoke, and then Carl.

334
00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:39.659
soispoke: Yeah, just wanted to say, I… I… I think the SFI is more important than the headliner for Fossil, because, again, I think…

335
00:56:39.690 --> 00:56:52.519
soispoke: if we followed through the whole history, was about, like, trying to get a credible commitment for… for Fossil, whether it's a headliner or not. And… yeah, I mean, my worry right now is that

336
00:56:52.760 --> 00:57:11.680
soispoke: you know, as a headliner, I already said that, but, like, forceful is very ill-suited, just because it is cross-layer, and it is quite a big EIP, but, like, it's not huge, and it's very ready, so it sits in between this sort of, like, EL and CL, and, like, huge

337
00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:18.260
soispoke: Feature versus very small, which makes it, yeah, a bit…

338
00:57:19.350 --> 00:57:35.320
soispoke: a bit weird, to fit in the headliner process, so I… I mean, I would be completely fine, SFI-ing it as a non-headliner, rather than CFI-ing it as a headliner, which I think is, yeah, more weird for the process.

339
00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.360
stokes: Yeah.

340
00:57:39.810 --> 00:57:44.369
stokes: I don't know, to me, like, Headliner is different than CFI or SFI, like…

341
00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:48.840
stokes: headliner is an intrinsic thing around the importance and impact of an EIP.

342
00:57:49.250 --> 00:57:57.940
stokes: And then, yeah, like, the CFI-SFI thing is kind of separate to that, where it's like, okay, we would have a headliner, and posted to that is that it's something that would be scheduled.

343
00:57:58.190 --> 00:58:12.069
stokes: And then we move forward to the usual process where, okay, you know, we CFI something to say, again, it's being considered for inclusion. As soon as we are ready to put it onto DevNets and the R&D process, it becomes SFI.

344
00:58:12.330 --> 00:58:19.470
stokes: And, you know, I think sort of the only shortcut there with the headliners is that they sort of de facto and or immediately go from

345
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.950
stokes: Let's see if I'd ask if I stop.

346
00:58:22.650 --> 00:58:23.650
stokes: Carl.

347
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:28.450
Carl Beekhuizen: Maybe this is just a misconception on my part, but…

348
00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:35.549
Carl Beekhuizen: My understanding of Headliner is also a lot to do with the size of this, and I do feel like the fossil's pretty big.

349
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.900
Carl Beekhuizen: I feel like it's wrong to be deciding.

350
00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:42.990
Carl Beekhuizen: on whether you're SFI- this or not, based, like, without it… being…

351
00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:47.839
Carl Beekhuizen: A headliner, because from my perspective, this is a rather large change.

352
00:58:47.970 --> 00:58:51.389
Carl Beekhuizen: Maybe it's not as large as some of the other things we've had as headliners, but…

353
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:54.169
Carl Beekhuizen: So, pretty impactful.

354
00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:56.919
Carl Beekhuizen: I think that's one thing. The second thing is, like, if…

355
00:58:57.410 --> 00:59:09.259
Carl Beekhuizen: we are going… like, wanting to go down this route. In the past, we've first decided the headliners, and later on, decided what else goes in the fork, based on how much capacity we have left after deciding the headliners.

356
00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:18.120
Carl Beekhuizen: They're the most important things, so I think specifying this before we do that, and then…

357
00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:21.800
Carl Beekhuizen: Finally, I think the…

358
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:27.390
Carl Beekhuizen: credible commitment thing here is, like, something that's been run with a little bit too hard, and I think…

359
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:33.539
Carl Beekhuizen: There's a little bit of… we tried to abuse the process to try and make…

360
00:59:33.790 --> 00:59:45.690
Carl Beekhuizen: this feature not go… not happen in Glamsterdam due to complexity, when I think that was a backwards way of doing this. I think this was… would have been too complicated to put in Glamsterdam, especially if you want to keep shipping things on shorter timelines.

361
00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:50.689
Carl Beekhuizen: And so we should have just put the bulletin and been like, this can't be in Amsterdam based on that, we don't…

362
00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:52.250
Carl Beekhuizen: need to.

363
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:55.039
Carl Beekhuizen: make these credible commitments, and I think, like.

364
00:59:55.570 --> 00:59:59.580
Carl Beekhuizen: That was… I don't know if that was the initial intention, of these…

365
00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:06.350
Carl Beekhuizen: things around credible commitments, but I feel like this spiraled very quickly out of control, and then people, like, feel let down because…

366
01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:12.059
Carl Beekhuizen: They feel like we need to give them these things, around… Or on fossil.

367
01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:26.710
Carl Beekhuizen: I just think there's, like, that the path of how we got here has been a little bit unfortunate, and has, like, resulted in a lot of this fatigue, and keep having to ask the dads what they want or whatever, and I think, as we mentioned, it's clear the devs do want something like Fossil, but

368
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:30.580
Carl Beekhuizen: It still needs to be considered within the greater picture, and…

369
01:00:36.180 --> 01:00:36.920
stokes: Gonna talk?

370
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:44.699
vitalik: Yeah, I mean, I, yeah, like, I remember being in the call a couple of weeks ago, right? And,

371
01:00:44.700 --> 01:01:08.889
vitalik: It certainly felt to me like, we were… we justified Fossil not being in Glamsterdam under the, arguments that, like, basically everyone wants it, and, it's, like, of course it's going to happen in H-star, and, the people saying that it'll just keep on getting pushed back more and more are being, like, unrealistic.

372
01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.730
vitalik: and, like, from…

373
01:01:12.460 --> 01:01:20.060
vitalik: that perspective, like, we definitely do have a history of pushing things back more and more, and, I,

374
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:29.610
vitalik: I think in this situation, there's a lot of, a lot of value in, like, actually, yeah.

375
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:43.110
vitalik: showing that we are able to, like, hold ticket… to commitments if we decide… if we decide to do them. And, I think, I mean, more…

376
01:01:44.400 --> 01:02:00.530
vitalik: more generally, right? Like, the process needs, some kind of defense against, like, things, continually getting put… getting pushed back more and more until they, until they eventually don't happen, and just,

377
01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:19.050
vitalik: like, basically the, yeah, like, actually, yeah, actually getting it out there and giving people confidence, that it will get out… that it will get out there seems like something that, a lot of people have been counting on. Like, I don't think we can…

378
01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:24.970
vitalik: Isolated from all of the, all of the other discussions.

379
01:02:29.530 --> 01:02:30.790
stokes: Right, yeah.

380
01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:39.730
stokes: I think my take here is that it's definitely a headliner. Like, I think, you know, possibly is big, and it does have a lot of impact. We should be…

381
01:02:39.930 --> 01:02:53.360
stokes: proud of that, and, like, give it the recognition it deserves, that it is a headliner. If it is a headliner, you know, we have this fairly new process around that, which would make it a bit tricky to…

382
01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:57.759
stokes: move ahead with some, you know, definitely SFI today.

383
01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:03.869
stokes: Again, because we are going to start the headliner process for HECA in, you know, just a few weeks' time.

384
01:03:04.130 --> 01:03:07.680
stokes: So, I think given that we don't want to…

385
01:03:09.130 --> 01:03:17.819
stokes: not respect this new process that we are trying to install to make ACD more smooth around scoping and EIP selection.

386
01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:22.910
stokes: We should just respect that and move forward with this again in a few weeks' time.

387
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:27.799
stokes: I think it was June, then Carl, then my client.

388
01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:34.430
Jihoon: I wanted to talk about

389
01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:38.169
Jihoon: Also, but if the decisions already made.

390
01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:44.890
stokes: Oh, sorry?

391
01:03:46.270 --> 01:03:49.430
stokes: No, yeah, you can, yeah, you can, you can share.

392
01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:54.160
Jihoon: Yeah, so, I just wanted to say… share that,

393
01:03:54.380 --> 01:04:03.819
Jihoon: From my understanding, the main reason behind pulling fossil from Klamsterdam was fork scope, which affects some fork cadence.

394
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:12.619
Jihoon: And I do agree that we will also want to respect the process, but in terms of better pipelining perspective.

395
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:24.850
Jihoon: Sfi… I think SFI and Fossil will help us a lot to achieve faster fork cadence, as we can have developers' attention, either it be core devs or

396
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:33.059
Jihoon: APM Fellows, so… Regarding fossil readiness, we had 4 CLs and 1 EL interrupt a while ago.

397
01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:45.049
Jihoon: Nethermind was close to make the intro, but has been busy with other stuff, and then EPA Fellows came up in a bottom-up fashion, and they've built RES and Aragon EL prototypes.

398
01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:59.389
Jihoon: So, as soon as we can have core devs attention by SFI, for example, I expect we can have 8 clients interop very soon, which is more than enough for kicking off the first DevNet.

399
01:04:59.810 --> 01:05:06.250
Jihoon: And yes, this is based on Fusaka, but we already know how to rebaste fossil onto Goloas.

400
01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:17.329
Jihoon: And core devs have estimated development time for the rebase will be roughly a month, once we have working EPS implementation.

401
01:05:22.940 --> 01:05:23.750
stokes: Yeah.

402
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:39.859
stokes: if anything, I think my takeaway from that is that, yeah, there's a lot of work that's gone into this, and so it should be a very straightforward, or let me say, it's a very strong case to be made for it as a headliner.

403
01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:40.900
stokes: Okay.

404
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:54.279
stokes: You know, if we wanted to find some solution that still signals, like, hey, this is, very important and top of queue for core development generally, I think Nick's suggestion of CFI.

405
01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.290
stokes: Today, makes a lot of sense.

406
01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:01.590
stokes: But yeah, Carl and Matt, and then, yeah, we should probably move on to other things.

407
01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:07.120
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, I want to push back against Vitalik a little bit, saying that we're, like.

408
01:06:07.810 --> 01:06:09.740
Carl Beekhuizen: We have a history of delaying things.

409
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:11.120
Carl Beekhuizen: And…

410
01:06:11.320 --> 01:06:17.960
Carl Beekhuizen: in order to, like, making sure that that was also not being shipped. I don't think that's the case here. I don't think anyone talking about

411
01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:24.390
Carl Beekhuizen: This process here is, like, trying to delay fossil for the sake of not getting included.

412
01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:26.910
Carl Beekhuizen: I think it's, like…

413
01:06:28.210 --> 01:06:33.399
Carl Beekhuizen: Like, at least that's my perception. I know there's some people who really don't like fossil that much, but I don't think there are that many.

414
01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.610
Carl Beekhuizen: I think it's more just about

415
01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:41.869
Carl Beekhuizen: questioning whether it's the right thing to do right now, and I think the same has been true for many of the other things we've delayed. It hasn't been about…

416
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:50.350
Carl Beekhuizen: not wanting them at all. It's just been about, hey, we only have limited resources that we can spend on this, and is it the right thing to be doing right now? Is it the most impactful thing?

417
01:06:51.180 --> 01:07:11.019
vitalik: Right, well, hold on, there's two separate arguments, right? One, which is that following the process is good, and the other is the idea that this is a lower priority than 6-second slots, and I think the second one is, like, one that, a lot of people are really against. I mean…

418
01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.800
vitalik: I… yeah.

419
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:30.069
vitalik: I don't know, like, I feel really against it, because, they basically, it's, it feels like the sort of thing where, like, we, really would be just continuing to push, back everything related to censorship resistance more and more.

420
01:07:30.270 --> 01:07:31.950
vitalik: And,

421
01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:50.160
vitalik: Like, that, like… and so I think, like, it is, it is important to separate those two arguments now, right? Because, like, I personally talk to a lot of people who are afraid that, Ethereum is, going into a, kind of… basically,

422
01:07:51.320 --> 01:08:04.139
vitalik: a mode that deprioritizes everything other than acceleration, and it's, like, really important to clearly show that, that's not what we're doing. And, that, like.

423
01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:11.499
vitalik: Basically, the fossil is being eaten, delayed or done in a particular time for good technical reasons.

424
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:23.890
Carl Beekhuizen: I mean, I agree with what you said, I'm personally one of the people who thinks acceptance slots would be more impactful, but do you still really want to see Fossil on Chain at some point?

425
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:30.699
Carl Beekhuizen: I think from the people I've spoken to, I've seen a lot of the opposite opinion. I think

426
01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:37.780
Carl Beekhuizen: a lot of people hear Fossil and think it's just a censorship resistance thing, and then don't understand that there's some nuances there, like…

427
01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:39.980
Carl Beekhuizen: Fossil doesn't, include…

428
01:08:40.130 --> 01:08:52.660
Carl Beekhuizen: censorship resistance for blobs, or fossil has this 8KB limit, so it's not really useful for people that use a lot of data, so it's not useful for the stock people. Things like that, I think, are…

429
01:08:52.790 --> 01:08:55.850
Carl Beekhuizen: A little underappreciated and under-discussed.

430
01:08:56.370 --> 01:08:58.190
Carl Beekhuizen: But yeah, I mean, that's the one…

431
01:08:58.300 --> 01:09:03.139
Carl Beekhuizen: I do hear your points. The second thing I wanted to touch on quickly is just about…

432
01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:08.899
Carl Beekhuizen: What we're talking about here in terms of timelines is, like, we're… the proposal's just to be discussing this again in

433
01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:13.829
Carl Beekhuizen: January, where we're gonna have the headliner process.

434
01:09:14.479 --> 01:09:22.740
Carl Beekhuizen: I don't… there's not like there's this major delay in terms of when we are discussing it, and I don't really see opinions shifting that much between now and then, so I don't think there's, like, this huge risk being taken by

435
01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.640
Carl Beekhuizen: Hustle to be following the process?

436
01:09:27.010 --> 01:09:28.859
Carl Beekhuizen: Anyway, I think my opinions are not on this one.

437
01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:35.009
stokes: Alright, like Client, and then we'll wrap up.

438
01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:42.819
lightclient: Yeah, I just wanted to say, I feel like we're trying to do some process engineering here. Like, it doesn't really feel like the right place to…

439
01:09:42.819 --> 01:09:57.200
lightclient: talk about alternative proposals to fossil, or we're not really talking about technical aspects of fossil, we're just trying to close the fork scoping for Glamsterdam, and then we have this weird aspect of making a commitment for the future, and…

440
01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:07.079
lightclient: It doesn't seem like an open process when we're, like, committing to the next thing, when we've already communicated what the process should be, and so people who might not agree with what the next thing is

441
01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:17.220
lightclient: is supposed to be are not coming onto this call and, like, making alternative proposals. So I think, like Carl said, we're not saying we're never gonna do this, we're just saying, let's follow the process starting

442
01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:26.520
lightclient: when the process starts as soon as possible, which is gonna be January, that's a month away. If it is the most supported thing for the headliner process, then we're just gonna put it into

443
01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.350
lightclient: H-star, regardless.

444
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.339
lightclient: So, I think that CFI is the right thing to do there.

445
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.330
stokes: Caspar?

446
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:36.450
stokes: Most common.

447
01:10:37.330 --> 01:10:39.050
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: I just wanted to say that.

448
01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:47.199
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: The process, in my mind, as of last ACDC was to ask clients whether to SFI or not on this call.

449
01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:54.509
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: And I think clients can take into consideration whether they think it's too much of a deviation from the process.

450
01:10:54.840 --> 01:11:02.940
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: to SFI now, and decline it on the basis of that, but I think we've asked clients

451
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:06.630
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: To form an opinion, and you can just ask them.

452
01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:20.580
lightclient: The point of the process, though, is to communicate publicly about how we make decisions and do operations, and if the clients can always just, you know, pick what they want to do immediately, and not

453
01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.919
lightclient: You know, have an open communication and process about it, then…

454
01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.639
lightclient: You know, what was the point of even saying, this is how we're gonna do things?

455
01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.409
soispoke: No, but it's been open and communicated.

456
01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:33.119
lightclient: It's been open for Glamsterdam.

457
01:11:33.400 --> 01:11:34.180
soispoke: Well, 5 months.

458
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:37.999
lightclient: It's not been… it's been open for Glamsterdam. It's not been open for H-star.

459
01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:43.639
soispoke: I mean, we've literally asked clients again, right? Like, what do you guys think? And they…

460
01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:44.280
lightclient: Again, it's not.

461
01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:44.900
soispoke: Just for clients.

462
01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:56.530
lightclient: It's for the entire community. It's for… it's an open process for everyone involved. It's not just, like, clients who are deep in this thing, who are coming to all the calls to come and say, you know, I want to do this next.

463
01:11:56.760 --> 01:12:15.239
soispoke: What I'm saying is, last time you said, maybe we are afraid it's too… it's just, like, individual decisions, and basically emoji-based inclusion of things, so… and I think the decision was to say, okay, let's actually ask client teams once again, because that's fair, like, we actually need

464
01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.310
soispoke: To ask them their opinions maybe one more time, and now we are doing that, and we don't…

465
01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:28.769
soispoke: care, apparently, because we are asking them, but we don't take into account that… those opinions. So why are we asking them if we just move on anyways?

466
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:38.230
lightclient: I don't know, I wasn't the one who proposed we ask them. I think, and I've said from the beginning, that we should just do the headliner process ASAP and pick Fossil, or whatever, as the headliner.

467
01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:42.690
lightclient: Not these, like, credible commitments that, like, circumvent the process.

468
01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.190
soispoke: But then we are, like, in a very tough situation, right? Because, like, either we go back on what we say.

469
01:12:50.480 --> 01:13:02.689
soispoke: And then, like, you can't really trust what we say, because the point of, like, saying things and trying to get to critical commitments and everything is, like, to stick to it. Or, we go against this

470
01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:14.040
soispoke: process that now seems to be overruling every other aspect, including, like, what importance a feature brings to the table, which is just, like.

471
01:13:14.290 --> 01:13:22.550
soispoke: both situations are, like, there. We need to just choose one, basically. And I think that is up to clients.

472
01:13:22.770 --> 01:13:35.890
soispoke: Probably, and people in this call to decide, and I think there is no concern about, like, the community being completely taken aback by the fact that Fossili will be included in the next fall. Like, they've been asked for 5 months

473
01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:44.770
soispoke: what they thought, they've participated again and again, they keep being very supportive, so I don't think there would be, like…

474
01:13:44.770 --> 01:13:48.070
lightclient: Amsterdam. We didn't start the process for H-star yet.

475
01:13:51.290 --> 01:14:01.400
stokes: Yeah, I mean, maybe just to jump in here, so, you know, I think the intent was we would try to find a way to commit in HECA. I think it should be clear that

476
01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.399
stokes: We are not able to find a way.

477
01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:10.000
stokes: it's… it is contentious. I think in light of that, we fall back on the process.

478
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:14.819
stokes: So, in terms of moving forward, that is what I would propose.

479
01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:20.530
stokes: Yeah, essentially, we just do DFI for Glenshire Dam today.

480
01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.450
stokes: We picked this back up with the headliner process in January for HECA.

481
01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.109
stokes: And, again.

482
01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:34.650
stokes: I think, reading the room, it should be very clear that this is a leading candidate for HECA as a headliner.

483
01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:41.489
soispoke: What do you think about NSCALS?

484
01:14:41.630 --> 01:14:45.320
soispoke: position to SFI without the headliner decision.

485
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:56.569
stokes: Yeah, so again, I think we should be honest about it being a headliner, and because of that, it would be sidestepping the headliner process to do this.

486
01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.369
stokes: Which, you know, I think earlier I was more optimistic that this was…

487
01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:03.059
stokes: You know, something we could do.

488
01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:08.669
stokes: I think even as soon as we had the idea, it became contentious in and of itself.

489
01:15:08.850 --> 01:15:14.519
stokes: So, yeah, like, I think, you know, this is the first time we're doing this headliner process, but lesson learned.

490
01:15:14.650 --> 01:15:18.630
stokes: We shouldn't be trying to… yeah.

491
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:20.659
stokes: Be optimistic in the…

492
01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:25.689
stokes: This way, in terms of, like, pipelining things or trying to move forward before the process has time to play out.

493
01:15:26.430 --> 01:15:27.650
stokes: And…

494
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:33.580
stokes: then yeah, I think that brings us to where we are. I think, again, we just picked this back up in January.

495
01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:35.789
stokes: And move forward with Glancer Dam today.

496
01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:47.450
Trent: That sounds good to me.

497
01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:02.700
stokes: Okay.

498
01:16:03.660 --> 01:16:05.299
stokes: Then, let's do that.

499
01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:11.850
stokes: And again, you know, apologies for any additional thrash or anything.

500
01:16:13.670 --> 01:16:17.539
nixo: Wait, sorry, is this decision to not make a decision?

501
01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:27.239
stokes: the decisions to DFI for Amsterdam, and then we would go back to the process for headliner selection in Perka.

502
01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:36.350
nixo: go back to the decision to make it a CFI or a SFI today?

503
01:16:39.650 --> 01:16:43.899
stokes: we can have that discussion. I think we also need to move on.

504
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:48.309
stokes: I think your proposal to CFI?

505
01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:51.109
stokes: is interesting.

506
01:16:51.570 --> 01:16:56.290
stokes: it does capture the community support, you know, and CoreDev's support today.

507
01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.809
stokes: The proposal was to not do that.

508
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:04.529
stokes: Are you saying you would like to push for CFI?

509
01:17:05.890 --> 01:17:09.570
nixo: I would push for a decision. At this point, I don't even care if it's CFI or F…

510
01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.240
nixo: Specified, let's just make a decision today.

511
01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:18.110
stokes: Yeah, and so what I'm saying is that we should just follow the process that we have.

512
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:22.009
stokes: We reached DF5 for Amsterdam.

513
01:17:22.770 --> 01:17:25.490
stokes: And then we'll open the headliner process in January.

514
01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.960
stokes: Also, we'll be there.

515
01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.660
soispoke: Wait, so it's not even CFI'd?

516
01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.070
stokes: We can CFI.

517
01:17:43.790 --> 01:17:46.470
nixo: See if I… also, a bunch of people have their hands up.

518
01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:54.269
stokes: Yeah, I think, like, Clan and Kesper were from previous clicks.

519
01:17:54.990 --> 01:17:56.170
stokes: Potus?

520
01:17:57.970 --> 01:18:12.569
Potuz: Yeah, so I support what Nex is saying. I think, kind of, CFI in it is uncontroversial. I agree with you that it seems that we cannot make… we couldn't come to consensus into making a credible commitment for next work.

521
01:18:12.950 --> 01:18:17.560
Potuz: But I think there was overwhelming consensus that CFI status was granted.

522
01:18:17.670 --> 01:18:22.199
Potuz: And also, that would be… give the communities at least some signal that we…

523
01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:33.410
Potuz: we agreed to have this discussion, we just couldn't come to consensus on how to signal for the next fork, but we have some form of consensus. It's not that we're completely broken and we cannot agree on anything.

524
01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:36.820
Potuz: And I think CFI was overwhelmingly approved.

525
01:18:38.330 --> 01:18:39.670
stokes: Yeah, okay.

526
01:18:40.110 --> 01:18:42.620
stokes: the CFI for HECA.

527
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.319
stokes: I can make the change to the MIDIP.

528
01:18:45.430 --> 01:18:46.549
stokes: After this call.

529
01:18:47.190 --> 01:18:49.389
stokes: Then we'll pick this back up in January.

530
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:53.159
stokes: So, to play this all back…

531
01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:01.020
stokes: DFI in Glamsterdam, CFI in HECA. We'll start the Hellowner selection process in January.

532
01:19:01.390 --> 01:19:02.320
stokes: Break up.

533
01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:05.760
stokes: Can we move forward with this?

534
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:15.420
stokes: Okay, I'm seeing many thumbs up.

535
01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:18.560
stokes: Please? Well, I don't know.

536
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:28.190
stokes: What I don't want to have happen is this happened a few calls ago, where we made a different decision on fossil, and there were a lot of thumbs up, and then we basically walked that back.

537
01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:35.140
stokes: So, let me just play it back one more time, so we're on the same page, and I know this is taking a lot of time on the call. It's important.

538
01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:39.470
stokes: DFI for… okay, Fossil… DFI for Glamsterdam.

539
01:19:40.190 --> 01:19:40.980
stokes: Okay.

540
01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.210
stokes: CFI.

541
01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:44.460
stokes: For Hecca.

542
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:48.019
stokes: We'll start the headline process in January.

543
01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:52.950
stokes: Where again, all of his support should show up, and I think it will be a very strong contender.

544
01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:54.540
stokes: Or the headliner for ECA.

545
01:19:56.910 --> 01:19:58.920
stokes: I think we should move on.

546
01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:01.720
stokes: We're getting agreement.

547
01:20:01.990 --> 01:20:07.440
stokes: Again, I know this is… been rocky and contentious, and I apologize for that.

548
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:09.529
stokes: I think we're in a good path.

549
01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.050
stokes: From here.

550
01:20:14.290 --> 01:20:15.070
stokes: Okay.

551
01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:16.449
stokes: Thank you, everyone.

552
01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:19.480
stokes: Well, let's move on.

553
01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:27.260
stokes: Okay, we do only have… it looks like 25 minutes left.

554
01:20:27.710 --> 01:20:30.460
stokes: So, let's try to get through the other EIPs.

555
01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:39.530
stokes: I believe the only thing we had to touch on were these three, so 7688, which are the stable container EIPs.

556
01:20:39.740 --> 01:20:46.080
stokes: And we essentially had a question of what to do with 8080 versus 8061.

557
01:20:47.150 --> 01:20:51.969
stokes: I suppose we'll just go in order here. So, with 7688,

558
01:20:52.530 --> 01:20:58.020
stokes: We had said we wanted to take some time to do a little more due diligence on the complexity here.

559
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:01.079
stokes: This would reach into SSD libraries, would also check…

560
01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:08.070
stokes: some consensus types, in Glenser Dam, which, yeah, I think kind of has some pretty big implications.

561
01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:19.370
stokes: Yeah, I would be very curious to hear from client teams if they have updated thoughts on inclusion of 7688 for Glamsterdam.

562
01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.280
stokes: Okay, yeah, Etan, would you like to say something?

563
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:39.779
Etan (Nimbus): I mean, I…

564
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.030
Trent: Can't really hear you.

565
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.600
Etan (Nimbus): Mmm.

566
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.930
stokes: Yeah, your audio's pretty batty, Tom.

567
01:21:54.720 --> 01:21:56.460
Etan (Nimbus): Is this better?

568
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:57.939
Trent: No, it's not better.

569
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:06.930
stokes: Yeah, maybe I can try to help here. So, there's this PDF…

570
01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:10.979
stokes: And if I open it up,

571
01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:16.890
stokes: Okay, so I think this looks like calling out which of the types would change?

572
01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:22.370
Etan (Nimbus): Fairfield.

573
01:22:22.370 --> 01:22:26.500
stokes: Yeah, it's still… I don't know, it's, like, very droppy.

574
01:22:26.670 --> 01:22:32.339
stokes: Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what to make of this either.

575
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:34.440
Etan (Nimbus): Goodbye.

576
01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:45.190
Potuz: It's an explanation of why the CIP… I mean, that PDF at least looks like an explanation of why the EIP is useful, in that it prevents those changes in the generalized indices.

577
01:22:45.520 --> 01:22:51.560
stokes: Alright, so I think we understand the benefits of the feature, though. It's more, like, I think the question is, like, okay.

578
01:22:52.040 --> 01:23:02.950
stokes: how much, like, what's the actual lift to get this implemented, and all the Z libraries, you know, I think they'll need to be tested, and then the question's also, from there, if they need to be audited.

579
01:23:05.410 --> 01:23:10.880
stokes: And yeah, let me, let me rephrase that. They will definitely have to be tested, and the question is, like, what does that imply?

580
01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:16.310
stokes: Do they need to be audited? Do, you know, there'll be fuzzing efforts, etc, etc.

581
01:23:16.570 --> 01:23:20.890
stokes: So, I think it's… yeah, it might end up being a bit more of an ask.

582
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:32.579
stokes: Also, you know, I think getting to a place where we're touching consensus types on top of changing the same consensus types with EPBS and Clemsterdam is a little tricky.

583
01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:36.180
stokes: So it's, yeah, a decision I think we should make lately.

584
01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:41.140
stokes: And… yeah, I mean, I have… my own…

585
01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.349
stokes: opinion, but yeah, I'd love to hear from client teams.

586
01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:48.980
stokes: Totas?

587
01:23:49.330 --> 01:23:56.369
Potuz: I just want to mention one thing about the CIP, which is… and I feel that this is getting sidetracked every time, but

588
01:23:56.790 --> 01:24:08.159
Potuz: the price that we pay by not including this every fork should count as complexity that we should have saved on the previous forks. By having the CIP before, we should have saved

589
01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:20.789
Potuz: complexity on previous forks, and we are always gauging this EIP against the complexity that it takes to implement for the next fork, forgetting how much we could have saved by having it earlier.

590
01:24:27.270 --> 01:24:30.040
stokes: Yeah, Barnabas is asking if PRISM's pro-inclusion.

591
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:36.679
Potuz: I don't think we have a common understanding on the CIP. I don't think we have a common agreement on the team on the CIP.

592
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.790
stokes: Okay.

593
01:24:39.670 --> 01:24:47.960
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think, again, I think we understand the benefits. The concern is just, you know, scope and complexity that ends up

594
01:24:48.740 --> 01:24:50.809
stokes: Becoming more than we think it is.

595
01:24:53.700 --> 01:25:01.269
stokes: Yeah, I mean, on that point, I think it'd be good to hear from, say, Pandops, or maybe the testing teams, if they have a, you know.

596
01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:03.540
stokes: Sense of the lift here.

597
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.860
stokes: Okay, just going over the chat here, so…

598
01:25:27.860 --> 01:25:34.129
stokes: There is generally support from the client teams, which is a good signal,

599
01:25:34.460 --> 01:25:39.379
stokes: Yeah, Solius has a suggestion that basically, you know, we attempt this.

600
01:25:39.730 --> 01:25:47.689
stokes: Which, yeah, I… Don't know if this is the best way to do this,

601
01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.749
stokes: Just given other attempts at process things.

602
01:25:51.010 --> 01:25:53.440
stokes: But essentially, we would,

603
01:25:53.930 --> 01:26:01.339
stokes: CFI, and then when there's room, you know, once it's clear what's, what's possible, then we could think about,

604
01:26:01.630 --> 01:26:03.030
stokes: SFI decision.

605
01:26:05.170 --> 01:26:16.620
saulius: Yeah, just… just a small note. So, I think the current process is a bit, fast, how it works, every 6 months or so. It's…

606
01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:31.170
saulius: kind of, we shifted to, like, one big feature, plus, one headliner big feature, plus some small… some really small, things. And the problem I see is, in this process is that,

607
01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:48.910
saulius: it becomes really hard to fit mid-size features, which are not very small, and also not a headliner feature. So I think this 7688 kind of falls into this category.

608
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:55.200
saulius: And my suggestion, of course, it's not the best in terms of the process, but

609
01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:14.919
saulius: as soon as we know the actual situation with the headliner feature, this time it's going to be EPBS, which, you know, it's still… for myself, it's still not clear how long it will take all the clients to implement and test and so on.

610
01:27:16.020 --> 01:27:23.839
saulius: I mean, if we see that everything is going well, then why not to include this 7688 in Glamsterdam?

611
01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:36.940
saulius: But otherwise, if we see that we underestimated the complexity of EPBS, then, well, the only option is to keep the scope smaller. So that's my view.

612
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.509
stokes: I mean, so the question I'd have then is.

613
01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.370
stokes: how easy would it be to take out? Because I think what will happen is we'll get to a world where there's, like, you know.

614
01:27:46.500 --> 01:27:50.210
stokes: Partial implementation, like, people start moving down this branch.

615
01:27:50.590 --> 01:28:00.099
stokes: And, you know, so this definitely happened with the attestation, EIP impactra, where it ended up being more, yeah, more of a lift than we thought.

616
01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:04.500
stokes: But also, kind of got… The point where it was not worth it to take it out.

617
01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:12.869
stokes: I do think with the CIP, the changes are pretty self-contained, so… yeah, like, it seems like we could just do this work on a branch, and then…

618
01:28:12.970 --> 01:28:17.040
stokes: If it gets to that point, we could just… Discord the branch.

619
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:22.749
stokes: Does that align with client team's view of how they could go about doing this?

620
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:30.190
stokes: Burnabus?

621
01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:43.000
Barnabas: So I was following in the chat, and in the chat, basically every single, CL team, said that they are in favor of, including this, so I do not see a reason

622
01:28:43.110 --> 01:28:43.980
Barnabas: True.

623
01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:49.770
Barnabas: further discuss it. Let's just CFI it now, and then let's move on to the next CIP, because we only have, like, 15 minutes left.

624
01:28:52.110 --> 01:28:52.660
stokes: Yeah.

625
01:28:53.380 --> 01:28:54.180
stokes: Okay.

626
01:28:54.890 --> 01:29:00.549
stokes: That seems fair. So yeah, let's CFI7688 for Amsterdam.

627
01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:02.940
stokes: And…

628
01:29:03.110 --> 01:29:18.259
stokes: Yeah, I think, just, again, for the record, let's keep in mind these concerns are on complexity, and we should go about developing this in a way that it is possible to take out, if we get to a point where we feel like that's the best choice.

629
01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:25.900
stokes: But people do seem to say this is, yeah, a pretty self-contained change, and it's worth reaching for now.

630
01:29:26.510 --> 01:29:28.650
stokes: So, let's do that.

631
01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.390
stokes: Okay.

632
01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:38.370
stokes: So, we will see if I… 7688.

633
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:45.580
stokes: Okay, then we have the next two EIPs here, 8061 and 8080.

634
01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:54.929
stokes: And… So I think at one point, there was just 8061 here. We pulled out a subset into 8080.

635
01:29:55.270 --> 01:30:02.870
stokes: If Francesco's here, I would have a question, because I think, at this point, they're actually just two separate EIPs.

636
01:30:03.020 --> 01:30:05.570
stokes: And I'd like to confirm that.

637
01:30:06.050 --> 01:30:10.380
stokes: But then ultimately, yeah, the question is, we need to decide what we'd like to do.

638
01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:21.180
stokes: The last time we touched on this, 8080, essentially would handle this edge case that we had with withdrawals and consolidated validators.

639
01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:27.300
stokes: There was, you know, pretty broad support for it. The question then was, do we also want to do 8061?

640
01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.010
stokes: Which,

641
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:38.700
stokes: adjust the term limits. And the main thing here is this just provides better staking UX, especially if you're trying to exit the set.

642
01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:48.979
stokes: And I will say on this point, a number of parties have reached out from the community, so there's a comment here on the agenda from Fidelity.

643
01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.819
stokes: Essentially saying that, yeah, this is something they're in favor of.

644
01:30:53.400 --> 01:30:56.340
stokes: I also had…

645
01:30:57.010 --> 01:31:06.940
stokes: someone from Bitwise reached out, who was also in support of the… so I just wanted to, again, add these quotes to the record,

646
01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:12.879
stokes: In terms of their support, you know, as community approval for these… At least for AD61.

647
01:31:14.490 --> 01:31:24.230
stokes: So… From here, yeah, I think we should make the decisions here. I believe I would say…

648
01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:28.730
stokes: CFI 8080 is pretty… non-controversial.

649
01:31:30.200 --> 01:31:32.509
stokes: Then the question is, do we want to do 8061?

650
01:31:37.620 --> 01:31:41.249
stokes: So yeah, maybe to play that back, I would propose we see FY8080.

651
01:31:44.690 --> 01:31:46.000
stokes: Any disagreements?

652
01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:51.410
stokes: Okay.

653
01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.959
stokes: I would also propose that we see FY8061.

654
01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:01.720
stokes: And the main thing here is that it will shorten the week's subjectivity period, which is the main question.

655
01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:04.510
stokes: So, I'm curious what client teams think about this.

656
01:32:12.230 --> 01:32:15.750
stokes: I don't think they are Barnabas. I mean, we talked about this in the last CL call, and…

657
01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:17.999
stokes: Everyone was in support.

658
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:34.230
Dustin: I do have a question regarding ADE61, about, the…

659
01:32:35.130 --> 01:32:44.120
Dustin: person from Fidelity, their… their write-up, and talked about a 7-day, target, for the…

660
01:32:44.230 --> 01:32:50.720
Dustin: OE subjectivity period? Where does a 7-day target come from? Like, what… as, as a…

661
01:32:51.010 --> 01:33:07.589
Dustin: Because… because they framed us as… I mean, on one level, I think the correct approach was to say, what is the target? And then… then as the word, target that, as opposed to just sort of saying, we want to speed things up, and the receptivity period ends up where it ends up.

662
01:33:07.590 --> 01:33:13.660
Dustin: So I… that's, I think, the more principled approach, but where does the 7 days come from, is my question.

663
01:33:16.300 --> 01:33:28.569
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think it's just adjusting the turn parameters and seeing the result, and, you know, for the turn parameters in the IP, you end up with something like a week. But yeah, Francesco, you had your hand up. I don't know if you want to add anything.

664
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:45.369
Francesco: Yeah, I mean, I had my hand up for something else, but yeah, let me just, I guess, reply to this. Like I said in the shot, the 7 days is just a number, it doesn't come from anything, but just, like, the previous number that was, like, 16 days or, you know, 15 days or something, like, doesn't really come from anywhere.

665
01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:56.069
Francesco: Or, like, originally it didn't come from anywhere. But yeah, I guess what I wanted to say, originally was, like, again, this is just something that comes from the parameters that are currently in the IP.

666
01:33:56.090 --> 01:34:11.650
Francesco: we can just pick whatever we want. Of course, if we just pick the current number, then, you know, the IP is kind of pointless, it doesn't do anything. But, you know, it could be 12 days, it could be 10 days, it's just, like, there's a trade-off. Of course, it's not worth doing the IP if we say, oh, let's just reduce the week-side period.

667
01:34:11.670 --> 01:34:17.850
Francesco: From 15 days to 14 days, that's not gonna do basically anything, but again, it doesn't need to be 7 days.

668
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:31.880
stokes: Yeah, and then, just to be clear here, the, you know, I mentioned Fidelity and Bitwise, like, they were not involved with the CIP.

669
01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:34.340
stokes: They just wanted to signal support for it.

670
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:38.360
stokes: Just so that's clear.

671
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.930
stokes: Mmm… Okay.

672
01:34:43.190 --> 01:34:49.809
stokes: Yeah, I'm not hearing anyone say no to this. Actually, okay, no. There was a comment from Lighthouse,

673
01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.839
stokes: Yeah, Kingy, I don't know if you'd like to say more.

674
01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:04.999
kingy_sigp: Just that… just that the adjustments are, you know, it's always non-trivial when we… when we touch the consensus code, and we haven't seen

675
01:35:05.710 --> 01:35:13.760
kingy_sigp: We haven't seen the specific advantages that people would like to, achieve, so… I think that we could…

676
01:35:13.870 --> 01:35:20.390
kingy_sigp: We could go down the CFI path, if that's what everyone else wants to do, just that, it's…

677
01:35:20.670 --> 01:35:26.470
kingy_sigp: It may not be as easy as it looks, and it's something that we… We could easily get wrong.

678
01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:36.650
stokes: In terms of implementation, because I feel like this is something we have pretty good test support for, in terms of the spec test and things.

679
01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.260
kingy_sigp: Sure.

680
01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:46.780
kingy_sigp: I… yeah, sure. Look, if that's the direction everyone wants to go, that's… that's fine.

681
01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:49.800
stokes: Okay.

682
01:35:52.090 --> 01:35:57.739
stokes: it seems like Rough Consensus is leaning towards CF58061, but yeah, anyone…

683
01:35:58.000 --> 01:35:59.900
stokes: I feel like that doesn't represent their views.

684
01:36:03.530 --> 01:36:07.639
stokes: The proposal here is basically to… yeah, we can, like…

685
01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:12.310
stokes: further tweak the parameters to get to, like, the period we want.

686
01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:15.839
stokes: But in terms of making a decision today, we would go ahead and…

687
01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:20.300
stokes: CFI, unless, yeah, the conversation goes elsewhere.

688
01:36:20.580 --> 01:36:21.539
stokes: Greg.

689
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:33.920
Greg K |Lido: Yeah, so I'm a bit, confused. Like, I have the feeling that for all these IPs discussed after Fossil, there was no progress at all since the last ACDC.

690
01:36:34.050 --> 01:36:40.120
Greg K |Lido: So basically, we had CFI'd all those APs, and we were waiting for…

691
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:57.870
Greg K |Lido: kind of progress in the understanding of them from, like, all stakeholders, and I get the feeling that for most of them, like, the input we had now is very small, so I was curious, like, when do… should we expect a really final SFI or DFI decision? Because I was assuming that that was today.

692
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:05.070
stokes: Yeah, so the thing that we needed today is CFI things, or DFI.

693
01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:09.920
stokes: If we DFI them, then, you know, we don't think about them for Glensterdam, and we move forward.

694
01:37:10.650 --> 01:37:14.150
stokes: With the CFI decisions, it's, again.

695
01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:17.209
stokes: Kind of what it says. It's considered for inclusion.

696
01:37:17.430 --> 01:37:21.819
stokes: The framing should be, like, yes, the intent is to put this into the fork.

697
01:37:22.590 --> 01:37:30.680
stokes: From there, just in terms of process and actually, like, making this manageable to deploy, what we prefer to do is…

698
01:37:31.300 --> 01:37:41.859
stokes: target the SFI set on a given DevNet, let's say, and again, to make this manageable, you kind of go one by one, so what that would look like is, again, we're right now focused on EPBS.

699
01:37:43.080 --> 01:37:52.010
stokes: For DevNets, once that is good and stable, then we basically can move VIPs from CFI to SFI, so there's just a process there to get to it.

700
01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:56.830
stokes: I would also push back some, I think.

701
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:00.220
stokes: Yeah, we have made progress.

702
01:38:01.030 --> 01:38:11.769
stokes: again, yeah, I don't think Etan can really speak, but he did, make this, you know, diagram to call out the changes. I think people have had time to think a bit more about the implications there.

703
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:14.410
stokes: So, yeah, we made progress there.

704
01:38:15.570 --> 01:38:17.000
stokes: And…

705
01:38:17.260 --> 01:38:28.510
stokes: Otherwise, yeah, now we're just kind of discussing these last two. And we had already, I think, had a pretty good agreement on CFI for one, and then the question was just 8061 now with weak subjectivity.

706
01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:48.839
stokes: And on that note, what I'm hearing is, yeah, other than perhaps Lighthouse with some concerns, but they're open if everyone else would like to move forward, we would go ahead and see if I…

707
01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:58.279
stokes: 8061 along with 8080, and then, of course, obviously, the exact parameters can be tuned as we go through the R&D process.

708
01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:11.450
stokes: So… That would be the proposal. To CFI7688.

709
01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:15.650
stokes: Cfi 8061 and CFI 8080.

710
01:39:16.290 --> 01:39:20.190
stokes: And… That's what we do today.

711
01:39:22.270 --> 01:39:24.600
stokes: Does this sound good from the client teams?

712
01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:38.470
stokes: Okay.

713
01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:42.440
stokes: No one seems to have an issue, so let's do that.

714
01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:54.050
stokes: And… okay, we just have a few minutes left, so… to round things out, let's move to Hecca and Bogota.

715
01:39:54.630 --> 01:39:56.030
stokes: And…

716
01:39:56.290 --> 01:40:03.099
stokes: I think the main thing I wanted to call out today was, just a proposal here in terms of how to move forward.

717
01:40:03.290 --> 01:40:05.140
stokes: with Scopian there.

718
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:13.529
stokes: So, again, this is following, the process that we've established for Glamsterdam post-Petra.

719
01:40:14.170 --> 01:40:22.439
stokes: And… Yeah, the… the immediate next step is this retrospective period, following the one…

720
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:25.979
stokes: One for Picture, we now have one for Fusaka.

721
01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:29.239
stokes: Which, again, we covered that earlier in the call.

722
01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:45.330
stokes: Then from here, the proposal would be to essentially copy, the process from Glamsterdam, where, again, you know, we have some time for fork, fork focus and headliner proposals, then move into headliner discussion, finalization.

723
01:40:45.430 --> 01:40:50.740
stokes: Then we do non-headliners, and, you know, from there, move to mainnet. So…

724
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.550
stokes: This Ethanitions post here is proposing a way to move forward there.

725
01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:10.770
stokes: And, you know, in terms of the next, critical thing here for HECA, it would have this headliner proposal process starting January 8th. I believe this is the first ACD that we'd have in the new year.

726
01:41:11.110 --> 01:41:12.679
stokes: That would go for about a month.

727
01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:17.530
stokes: Then we would move to outliner selection over the next month, and move forward from there.

728
01:41:18.340 --> 01:41:23.850
stokes: So, that's… that proposal.

729
01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:28.640
stokes: I don't know if people have any… January 5th, okay.

730
01:41:30.010 --> 01:41:37.420
stokes: then yeah, I might need to adjust the date. But that's basically the intent, is that we start the headliner discussion, just with ACD in the new year.

731
01:41:38.770 --> 01:41:40.439
stokes: So… yeah.

732
01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:52.759
stokes: Again, I think this is what we should do. I do think people generally feel like that liner process, you know, is productive in terms of bringing the community more involved and giving them a way to engage more productively.

733
01:41:53.100 --> 01:42:02.770
stokes: So, I would propose we follow a similar process, and yeah, in terms of timing, it's pretty straightforward, just about a month per segment.

734
01:42:03.180 --> 01:42:05.640
stokes: And then we move forward with Hecca and Bogota.

735
01:42:08.430 --> 01:42:10.539
stokes: Any comments or questions on that?

736
01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.340
stokes: Oh yeah?

737
01:42:14.620 --> 01:42:20.980
Leo: Yes, I wanted to, mention that I want to change, I mentioned this in the Discord, I wanted to mention the

738
01:42:21.150 --> 01:42:27.950
Leo: that I, I want to change the name of the star. We have been looking at this, and HECA is the first

739
01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:31.069
Leo: time that this is not really a startup is located in India.

740
01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:34.280
Leo: International Astronomical Catalogue of Stars.

741
01:42:34.820 --> 01:42:36.570
Leo: We look for it, and…

742
01:42:36.890 --> 01:42:49.490
Leo: It's kind of mentioned somewhere in a little corner in a Wikipedia page, but, yeah, and we… if we don't have, proper methodology, we, you know, we are running the risk that

743
01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:52.750
Leo: Maybe in the future, we're gonna have four names that are fake, or the…

744
01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:58.899
Leo: means something weird. So I would like to have a second vote for the name of the star.

745
01:42:59.130 --> 01:43:02.199
Leo: And following to that, the poor mantle as well.

746
01:43:07.030 --> 01:43:12.019
stokes: Okay, so you'd want to… at least the question is if we can change the name, effective.

747
01:43:12.380 --> 01:43:13.170
Leo: Yeah, that's correct.

748
01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:15.610
stokes: Yeah.

749
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:19.159
stokes: I don't know, I…

750
01:43:19.490 --> 01:43:24.239
stokes: kind of personally would say the ship has sailed. I don't know if other people feel like we should change the name.

751
01:43:24.710 --> 01:43:26.870
Leo: And there are some votes on the… on the chat.

752
01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:34.930
stokes: Okay.

753
01:43:40.130 --> 01:43:49.550
stokes: Hmm, okay, so… Let's see… I think in terms of moving forward…

754
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:55.490
stokes: We should take this discussion back to the naming thread that I think you linked here.

755
01:43:56.790 --> 01:44:02.540
stokes: Yeah, I think what I would say is if we really want to do this.

756
01:44:02.860 --> 01:44:08.150
stokes: then we should have an actual suggestion for next ACD, and make the call there.

757
01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:19.489
stokes: So do you think we can do that? Like, essentially, yeah.

758
01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:22.620
stokes: Because it's not part of this official list,

759
01:44:23.330 --> 01:44:29.610
stokes: Sure, we can go ahead and change it if people would like to, but I think also we should go ahead and have a name.

760
01:44:29.870 --> 01:44:31.000
stokes: Soon.

761
01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.669
stokes: So there should be…

762
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:37.189
Leo: There should be a proposal for next ACD next week, and then we can change it there.

763
01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:52.620
Leo: Sounds good, right? But I start a second vote, and I try to mobilize all the core devs to get a vote, and maybe by next week, we already have a vote, and then at that moment, we can decide if we change to the new, you know, most voted.

764
01:44:58.010 --> 01:45:02.860
stokes: Okay, so yeah, I mean, I guess if you can show support for a new name, and you want to bring it to ACD next week…

765
01:45:03.430 --> 01:45:06.080
stokes: then, yeah, I think we have a conversation there.

766
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:09.669
stokes: Yeah, does that sound good to you?

767
01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:12.840
Leo: Yep, sounds good. Thank you.

768
01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:25.439
stokes: And then, I think the last thing, because we are pretty much at time, but I was going to touch on the portmanteau.

769
01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.129
stokes: I will say right now, Hikota, Hakota, however you'd like to pronounce it, is a leading candidate.

770
01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:40.650
stokes: I think we need to pourmanteau also ASAP. So… Yeah.

771
01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:53.279
stokes: I suppose then, let's see if we can get a proposal to change HECA next week, and if so, I'll also try to have a portmanteau to propose also as something we want to lock in.

772
01:45:53.650 --> 01:46:00.579
stokes: And we would go ahead and finalize that, at the latest by next week, and then we can move forward.

773
01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:09.200
stokes: Okay.

774
01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:14.530
stokes: then I think we're at time.

775
01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.740
stokes: Thank you, everyone.

776
01:46:16.970 --> 01:46:22.210
stokes: For joining. I know there was a lot to cover today, and yeah, just,

777
01:46:23.100 --> 01:46:29.200
stokes: Yeah, thank you. Thank you for participating, and I'll see you on the next call.

778
01:46:29.610 --> 01:46:30.699
Shariq Naiyer: Have a good one, guys.

779
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:33.809
Potuz: Alright, guys.

780
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.540
Cayman Nava: Bye.

781
01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:36.730
Pooja Ranjan: Goodbye.
