00:18:52	lightclient:	i’ve said this before but i don’t think we have the capacity for this level of parallelization and the split 33% current fork and 66% fork+1 puts too much emphasis to the farther future fork

00:26:57	Ansgar Dietrichs:	so to summarize, there are three stages:
A) roadmap discussion
B) inclusion / scope discussion
C) shipping discussion

I fundamentally don’t think “A” should be in scope for acd, nor has it ever been historically.
And splitting “B” and “C” out more clearly makes sense in principle, but right now hard forks are so far apart that these stages are only partially overlapping to begin with

market. analysis.
00:39:28	Dustin:	Replying to "I think stakeholde..."

Not sure if this is good/bad, but this is a process designed for a maintenance/bugfixing model of the EVM. People will likely ask for some feature, or precompile, but likely not look at things architecturally.
00:39:42	Josh Davis:	@Marc working on this 🙂
00:40:05	sacha:	Replying to "I think researchers ..."

yes. that was a great first step!

in my experience, they often want to be heard but don't know how to be 

most of the tiem they feel like they're just "told" what to do and at some point i worry it's going to hit an inflection point where they won't be able to do what you expect (e.g. it'll put them out of business) and it'll cause issues (e.g. solana validator mutiny)
00:40:10	Tim Beiko:	My one suggestion would be to anchor to already exists vs. Creating yet another platform that will be abandoned in 18 months
00:40:15	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I think researchers ..."

@sacha I would actually take the other side of this: if you count features since the merge, there have been more staking related features than anything else. specifically because stakers / node operators are the direct customers of client teams, so they have the most direct connection to the acd participants.

compared to say app devs, with no such connection at all. or even L2s.
00:40:16	Dustin:	Replying to "I think stakeholde..."

Also, some of this is already done -- look at what changes various L2s make to their each bespoke custom ancient Geth forks

EL: focus on scaling

seems like the process is working as intended?

I agree with that, and I wonder how much of it we can get from refactoring EM

@Justin Florentine (Besu) Im not suggesting abandoning it, but the current population already has ACD/ethmag. It wouldn’t’t go away
00:47:44	Tim Beiko:	We should never schedule things “between hard forks” 😄

00:47:50	nixo:	i think more because maxeb was expected to be simpler
00:47:51	ethDreamer (Mark):	We decided it because we thought peerDAS was parallelizable and it was further away
00:47:54	Tim Beiko:	Reacted to "i think more because..." with 👍
00:47:55	ethDreamer (Mark):	That was the reasoning at the time

00:48:11	Tim Beiko:	PeerDAS also progressed quicker than expected in Nyota interop, which then got us to add it to Pectra. 

However, I agree we could have “bitten the bullet” there and focused on PeerDAS from the start because it was higher ROI than MaxEB.

IMO “technical readiness” should be 1/N of the things we evaluate when choosing a headliner.
00:48:12	ethDreamer (Mark):	I watched that old ACD recently lol

“parallelizable” is meaningless though, if then not actually worked on in parallel
00:49:13	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "We decided it becaus..."

in practice, fork inclusion is an implementation priority decision
00:49:25	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	when will we finalize the fusaka spec?
00:49:32	Ansgar Dietrichs:	but again, experimentation is necessary, so thank you very much for working this proposal out!

all nitpicking aside :-)

00:50:13	Tim Beiko:	On next ACDE, we should decide what other EL EIPs we want for the next 1-2 devnets

I think same issue as with EOF: we are missing insights into what would be useful there

00:50:25	Mikhail Kalinin:	one of the reasons behind MAXEB was potential decrease of the validator set which reduces the strain on the network. i think it is pretty important for the mainnet security. just wanted to remind that MAXEB isn’t only a UX improvement for stakers

How do we get these insights tho?

great question
