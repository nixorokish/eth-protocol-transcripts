00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.090
Sam Jernigan: Welcome to the 100 degrees

2
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.069
Sam Jernigan: which one of these 2 antiperspirants can stand up to. The heat looks like ordinary.

3
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.499
Justin Florentine (Besu): Good eath clock, friends.

4
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.880
stokes: Hello!

5
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.250
stokes: Let's see. Sorry I had another call. So

6
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.890
stokes: let's give it. Maybe one more minute and we'll kick things off.

7
00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:46.799
stokes: Okay, Josh, are you helping with the stream.

8
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.659
Josh Davis: Yeah, Brittany, when you are.

9
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:50.169
stokes: Alright! Let's go.

10
00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:54.830
Josh Davis: Your life.

11
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.950
stokes: Okay, thank you. Everyone.

12
00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:07.559
stokes: Welcome to Acdc, number 1, 5, 8. The agenda is here. It's issue 1548. And the Pm Repo.

13
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:15.759
stokes: so yeah, today we'll cover some Fussaka things and also open the Glamsterdam conversation.

14
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:19.719
stokes: And yeah, let's go ahead and get into it. So

15
00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.370
stokes: 1st up with Posaka. We have Posaka devnet 0

16
00:09:25.007 --> 00:09:31.599
stokes: Perry, would you be able to give an overview last time? I looked it looked a little little hectic.

17
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.849
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think Barnabas might have the latest on that one.

18
00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.870
stokes: Okay, great part of us. Would you mind updating us.

19
00:09:38.870 --> 00:10:04.125
Barnabas: So we basically set up 0 with being activated in epoch 256, and then every single Bpo will be 256 epochs later. So that will give us one day to observe if the Bpo. Is working as expected. If any clients are causing an issue, and we decided to go up, down and

20
00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:18.220
Barnabas: and so far, every everything seems okay. We had a few clients that that are still missing blocks and some clients that have issues appearing up. But we are actively looking into these issues.

21
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.230
Barnabas: But the concept of Bpo seems to be working.

22
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.970
Barnabas: Okay, okay.

23
00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:25.740
stokes: Okay, that's good news.

24
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:32.289
stokes: Cool anything else on Devnet 0.

25
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:43.529
Barnabas: We had a bit of misconception regarding removing the block count in flow.

26
00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:44.990
stokes: So.

27
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.030
Barnabas: There's a

28
00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:57.689
Barnabas: a clarification that had to be done, and we had to add an additional block schedule for the full fork, basically on the side.

29
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.200
Barnabas: So this, this was just basically saying that, hey in full, we still gonna be using 6 and 9.

30
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:09.570
Barnabas: But yeah, as as I mentioned, this only touched the sales.

31
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.250
stokes: Alright makes sense, and that's already live on Demo 0.

32
00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.850
Barnabas: Yeah, this this was done before the 1st before even full went live.

33
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.020
stokes: Gotcha.

34
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.790
stokes: Okay? Cool.

35
00:11:25.650 --> 00:11:26.530
stokes: Okay.

36
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:36.700
stokes: Then, next up we have on our schedule today to get to a final Sfi set for Fusaka

37
00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.759
stokes: and I wanted to go ahead and cover this now, because it might inform Devnet one scope.

38
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.560
stokes: So

39
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:53.800
stokes: yeah, essentially, the only question we have is Eip 7, 9, 1, 7. This was the one that gives us a proposal. Look ahead.

40
00:11:54.310 --> 00:12:03.799
stokes: and it fixes kind of an edge case in the protocol where the proposal. Look ahead is dependent on the shuffling that mixes in the balances, and these can change an epoch boundary

41
00:12:04.341 --> 00:12:12.199
stokes: this is not great if you need to rely on this proposal. Look ahead, use cases like Pre comps. Obviously come to mind for for this type of thing.

42
00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:15.520
stokes: And yeah, right now, it's Cfi.

43
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:24.550
stokes: And the question then is, if we want to go ahead and sfi this, and if so, we could even think about scheduling onto a devnet.

44
00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.400
stokes: Generally

45
00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:34.600
stokes: the framing has been. Get a stable devnet with these Cfi things. Sorry, sfi things before thinking about.

46
00:12:35.214 --> 00:12:35.540
Tomás Arjovsky | Lambda | Ethrex: Yeah.

47
00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:36.770
stokes: Moving

48
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:44.409
stokes: to just shove more features in but yeah, wanted to open the conversation now, because I think we should finalize what we want to do here today.

49
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.370
stokes: So

50
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:54.730
stokes: yeah, maybe to kick us off. Then I see Lynn is here. I don't know if any of the Eip authors want to make a case for this.

51
00:12:55.050 --> 00:13:04.940
stokes: I think something that would be super helpful is also hearing from the community here, which in this case would be users of Pre comps. Any Pre comp providers.

52
00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:09.489
stokes: And yeah, trying to get a sense of the demand for this.

53
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:13.190
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Yeah, I can give a quick

54
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.320
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: perspective from my side. So I think

55
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.949
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: so. I think, like, if you look at the big picture like

56
00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:24.900
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: we have the rollic centric roadmap, right?

57
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:30.990
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: And I think that was good like it. It makes sense to as a construction like you, post data to l. 1, but execute an L. 2.

58
00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:35.930
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: I think right now there's a lot of people who feel something wrong about the current roll ups

59
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.230
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: like there.

60
00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:42.779
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: It doesn't feel like they're just scaling the old one, or they're just like an execution extension of the old one.

61
00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:47.930
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: I think this is one of the reasons why we have like so much pushback right now, for.

62
00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.820
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: like L twos.

63
00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:55.960
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: and like going back to like our own scaling. And I think a core part of this is that

64
00:13:56.100 --> 00:14:04.509
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: of why it feels wrong is that I think one thing is a centralized sequencer, basically like just having a single server somewhere that's like sequencing your transactions.

65
00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.049
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: It doesn't feel like a natural extension of the old one. And

66
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:10.990
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: yeah, like, it seems to like

67
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:13.789
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: hurts the credible neutrality of the whole thing.

68
00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:17.549
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: And so like, basically, this will locks enable.

69
00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:21.229
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: And I think peace roll-ups are like the way to solve this.

70
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:31.590
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: it enemies will up centric roadmap, but like without the centralized sequencer, it's the only construction that's working right now in Mainnet, where you can actually remove the centralized sequencer.

71
00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:39.910
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: But, like the issue there is that we have very high latency, like we have to wait at least 12 seconds, or

72
00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:44.519
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: because visuals, they can't post every slot. So sometimes like

73
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.529
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: close to a minute, if the demand is not high.

74
00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:56.230
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: So this is why we need pre confirmations, and to actually lower this time to actually have, like a competitive based roll up.

75
00:14:57.250 --> 00:15:00.770
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: And so I think in the end, what I

76
00:15:01.070 --> 00:15:04.310
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: thing is that, like ethereum scaling is very important.

77
00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.929
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Velope is important for Athem scaling

78
00:15:07.360 --> 00:15:10.059
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: and paste roll-ups, I think, is important, for roll-ups

79
00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:14.989
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: and base pre confirmation is important, for base roll ups. So in the end, I think

80
00:15:15.510 --> 00:15:21.056
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: base and like for base pre confirmation, the cip will be like a very good

81
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:27.099
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Oh, it! It's very much needed, like at least to do it in a non hacky way.

82
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:34.729
stokes: Yeah, do you have a sense of how hacky it would be? I think that's a question. At least I have is like.

83
00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:41.919
stokes: you know? I think so. Yeah, the cip aims to like patch kind of a edge case in the protocol

84
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:47.570
stokes: and then to go ahead and trigger it. It's like, yeah, it's not straightforward. So I wonder if there's a sense of

85
00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:51.719
stokes: yeah, I guess how how important is it to fix this? Now.

86
00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:57.730
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Yeah, I think Jason has been looking a lot right now. He's in the call from fabric.

87
00:15:59.335 --> 00:16:00.140
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Yeah.

88
00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.545
Jason Vranek: Yeah, sure, thanks, guys. So yeah, fabric.

89
00:16:04.110 --> 00:16:18.530
Jason Vranek: we're working on 2 goals is one to like help existing. Roll ups become based. And 2 is help. New apps, launches based roll ups. So one of those initiatives was working on these inbox contracts for rollups. And

90
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:33.079
Jason Vranek: yeah, without this eip, it's it's pretty hacky, so like there's nice. I don't want to discount the importance of having look ahead. Stability. But for us, what really matters is allowing the look ahead to be accessible from the Beacon State.

91
00:16:33.661 --> 00:16:54.170
Jason Vranek: Without this, like, the problem we're trying to solve is that we need roll ups to be aware and respect the schedule of pre confers, and to do this they need a view of the look ahead. So without this, there's kind of 3 proposals. One that Tyco is working on right now is optimistic. Look aheads. You have to

92
00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:05.419
Jason Vranek: optimistically post your view of it and add these incentives, or trust like fault proofs after the fact like you can always use eip 4, 7, 8, 8 after the fact.

93
00:17:05.579 --> 00:17:07.440
Jason Vranek: Another proposal is

94
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:28.130
Jason Vranek: to sacrifice real time settlement, and l. 1. Composability, and retroactively determine the canonical L. 2. Head by figuring out who the proposer was. This is simpler, but a lot of the value prop of based roll-ups is real time settlement, and l, 1. Composability, unlocking things.

95
00:17:28.369 --> 00:17:33.120
Jason Vranek: and like a 3rd really hacky approach that might be the simplest on chain is just.

96
00:17:33.530 --> 00:17:51.029
Jason Vranek: You have to import all of the logic to derive the look ahead into your roll up state transition function, which starts to feel kind of like the beam chain effort. So adding the look ahead to the Beacon State just trivializes all these problems and makes it safer and cheaper

97
00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.540
Jason Vranek: to to run these ropes.

98
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.159
stokes: Yeah, that makes sense. Mark, you have your hand up.

99
00:17:59.110 --> 00:18:01.560
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I mean, I was just gonna say.

100
00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.600
ethDreamer (Mark): I think a simple way of looking at the problem is is like.

101
00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:16.099
ethDreamer (Mark): you know, these Pre. Comp. Protocols need to have the proposer on chain ideally ahead of time, and we know that there is an edge case where

102
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.900
ethDreamer (Mark): the proposer can change sort of last minute.

103
00:18:21.296 --> 00:18:27.539
ethDreamer (Mark): And so I mean in terms of getting information on chain. You have a few options you can

104
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.900
ethDreamer (Mark): do.

105
00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:33.100
ethDreamer (Mark): I mean ideally. You have proof that's with the cip, you can actually prove it.

106
00:18:34.810 --> 00:18:41.820
ethDreamer (Mark): if you don't have that, you have crypto economic systems. But in this case, since there's an edge case where

107
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:46.590
ethDreamer (Mark): you know, people can stake on a certain proposer. But then it can change last minute.

108
00:18:47.010 --> 00:19:07.569
ethDreamer (Mark): I mean, I think you you end up with a really complex crypto economic system, because people said the proposal was going to be one thing, and then it ended up being another. Even if that's a rare case. The fact that it's an edge case that could happen makes it like really hard to do that. And then you're you're left with, I guess like you said either implementing

109
00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:17.969
ethDreamer (Mark): like large chunks of the the bacon chain protocol on chain, or just having trust. So

110
00:19:18.590 --> 00:19:22.160
ethDreamer (Mark): it I mean, it just doesn't seem like there's a lot of good options

111
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.069
ethDreamer (Mark): here, if we don't just make it provable.

112
00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:29.200
stokes: Yeah, thanks.

113
00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:40.359
stokes: Okay, so yeah, a number of voices from people working in the space that would use this feature does seem like, there's some demand for it.

114
00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:47.499
stokes: I'd like to get a sense from core devs like how much of a lift this is to go into Fusaka. So I think that's kind of the

115
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:53.470
stokes: big constraint here is, we have pure dos and Fussaka. I think we'd all like to ship that as soon as possible.

116
00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.597
stokes: The question then, is like, is this the right time to include this Vip?

117
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:08.630
stokes: if we yeah risk Fusaka timelines at all, I think that's not great. At least, yeah, we should very intentionally make this make this trade off.

118
00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:15.490
stokes: So yeah, I'm curious. If any client teams have had a chance to look at this, or even have a sense of implementation, lift.

119
00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:30.209
ethDreamer (Mark): It's I mean, people may already know, but it's trivial in lighthouse.

120
00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:35.880
ethDreamer (Mark): I think the so far, what it comes down to is

121
00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:43.910
ethDreamer (Mark): basically, did your do? You already have a variant of the Fusaka Beacon State?

122
00:20:44.528 --> 00:20:50.439
ethDreamer (Mark): Because I know some clients may not, since, as of yet the Fusaka Beacon State has not changed

123
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:56.739
ethDreamer (Mark): from Electra, so it's identical. And so some clients have just reused the Electra Beacon State.

124
00:20:57.444 --> 00:21:11.229
ethDreamer (Mark): So if you already have a Fussaka Beacon State. It should be really fast. It really was quite easy in Lighthouse. If you don't, the question becomes, how much work is it for you to add a Fusaka beacon state.

125
00:21:14.197 --> 00:21:19.589
ethDreamer (Mark): Just for for the devs that haven't looked into this that appears to be the main

126
00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.200
ethDreamer (Mark): The main question.

127
00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:33.540
stokes: Yeah, yeah. Onsgar has a helpful comment here lighthouse and lodestar said above in the chat, that it's a pretty small lift.

128
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.720
stokes: similar for Teku

129
00:21:37.411 --> 00:21:43.660
stokes: and see as a point around testing. And yeah, I guess this is kind of the core thing, at least for me, is

130
00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:54.130
stokes: without this. We don't touch the Beacon state in Fusaka, so we just don't have to think about it. If we do include this, then the Beacon state does change. And so it just increases sort of the scope here.

131
00:21:55.117 --> 00:21:59.880
stokes: That being said, you know, our bread and butter is testing state transition changes. So

132
00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:07.650
stokes: it's not anything. Super novel? Yeah.

133
00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:16.409
stokes: Okay, Otis, do you want to speak to this a bit more? Your comments here.

134
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:25.895
potuz: Oh, I was just saying that, for prism is the same. It's just not as trivial as lighthouse that it's just one line change. But

135
00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:31.960
potuz: I've been told that we have this very well documented, and it shouldn't be a change that would take weeks.

136
00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:48.799
potuz: I think this discussion, however, is kind of irrelevant on the technical side. There's no argument on the technical merit of this cip, nor on the need of the eip, nor the difficulty of the eip. The only question here is, there are many easy changes

137
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.150
potuz: that are not scheduled for Fussaka.

138
00:22:52.899 --> 00:23:02.199
potuz: The question here is, is this going to delay Fusaka testing. Is it going to delay the fork or not? If everyone agrees that there's no delay possible because of this.

139
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:04.169
potuz: then I think there's no complaint.

140
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:16.279
potuz: If there's a risk that this is going to delay Fusaka having, we all have agreed that we wouldn't delay Fussaka under no circumstances, and this was part of our choosing on the scoping.

141
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:19.300
potuz: Then I think it's that's the question that we need to ask.

142
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.550
stokes: Yeah, I agree.

143
00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:25.529
stokes: Sorry if you've had your hand up for a minute.

144
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:35.099
saulius: Yeah. So in transfer it, or to to comment on portals ideas, I think I mean, any change

145
00:23:35.220 --> 00:24:03.470
saulius: actually should affect the delay, or whatever. I mean, it's it's a it's in any case extra work, and in any case extra effort. So I think, whatever we add, even if it's small thing, this almost 100% delays things because it's it's extra stuff. So this is one comment, another comment. I was just thinking

146
00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:17.564
saulius: theoretically, if we have a more predictable look ahead than we have now. There is a kind of theoretical, at least the way I think there is a theoretical

147
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:33.310
saulius: decrease in security in some sense. So I mean, likely it's a very minor or neglect, but but likely there is. So that's that's another point.

148
00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:39.299
stokes: Yeah, thanks.

149
00:24:39.736 --> 00:24:50.500
stokes: There's some good discussion in the chat here. So yeah, I think I'll start here. This is a question by pari, are there any unknown? Are there any unknown unknowns that could come up?

150
00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:58.090
stokes: And yeah, given that, it seems like implementation is straightforward. This is mainly a question of testing.

151
00:24:58.310 --> 00:25:05.589
stokes: There has been some testing already. I don't have the Pr handy, but there is one to the Fusaka specs from Lynn and Co.

152
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:07.559
stokes: With testing there.

153
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.610
stokes: So you know, it's not that. It's like, Oh, we need to go write the test. And maybe there's issues.

154
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:22.259
stokes: We have tests testing can be expanded. And again, this is pretty straightforward. All the client teams here know how to pull down the spec test and and run them. So

155
00:25:23.907 --> 00:25:28.440
stokes: yeah, are there any other things anyone sees that we should consider?

156
00:25:34.750 --> 00:25:35.560
stokes: Yeah, Mark.

157
00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:43.600
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, just an angle that I don't think has been mentioned is sort of like what

158
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.339
ethDreamer (Mark): our main priorities are as a protocol.

159
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:47.590
ethDreamer (Mark): And

160
00:25:48.284 --> 00:25:59.904
ethDreamer (Mark): I think there's pretty widespread agreement that like scaling blobs is one of our main priorities. And that's basically why we don't want to delay Osaka at all.

161
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.810
ethDreamer (Mark): yeah. But I would argue that, like Pre comps.

162
00:26:08.334 --> 00:26:13.655
ethDreamer (Mark): and based rollups are also one of our main priorities for for layer 2 experience.

163
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:26.170
ethDreamer (Mark): and that that's sort of why this eip is being considered, even if there are other eips that are also trivial. I I do think it's closer to

164
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:30.089
ethDreamer (Mark): our our main priority is a protocol, I guess would be.

165
00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:30.810
stokes: Yeah.

166
00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:31.230
ethDreamer (Mark): Let's see.

167
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:45.130
stokes: Yeah, I mean one comment on the other eips thing like we've gone through the process. And this is the only other eip currently, like there are an infinite number of other eips we could be talking about. But this is the one on our plate today. So

168
00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:51.909
stokes: let's let's just focus on this one, but that, all being said, no one has really

169
00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:56.780
stokes: voiced any opposition, and people generally seem like it wouldn't be a huge lift.

170
00:26:57.625 --> 00:27:03.809
stokes: So yeah, I think we go ahead and sfi it, unless anyone would like to dig into that more.

171
00:27:06.050 --> 00:27:11.139
stokes: there is the option of boiling it if we absolutely had to

172
00:27:11.922 --> 00:27:14.739
stokes: say for Amsterdam or some other fork

173
00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:17.489
stokes: that also has a cost. But

174
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.249
stokes: yeah, that seems to be where consensus is at right now.

175
00:27:34.803 --> 00:27:37.280
stokes: Yeah. I was reading Perry's comments here.

176
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:43.627
stokes: I feel like we were taking this the other way.

177
00:27:46.430 --> 00:27:50.520
stokes: I don't know, Perry, do you want to argue for this your your proposal versus the other way.

178
00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:59.030
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think my proposal is just that. First, st we need to have stuff on the test net so that we are

179
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:11.000
Parithosh Jayanthi: make sure that there aren't any problems. But also just reading Tim's message that Sfi just basically means next devnet. So I guess there's a counter argument for what order we do stuff in.

180
00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:15.589
potuz: What's the timeline parry for? To have this in for the next Devnet.

181
00:28:16.427 --> 00:28:22.600
Parithosh Jayanthi: The next one's on June 9, th and Devnet 2. We don't have a date yet, but we would like to have it in June.

182
00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:25.599
potuz: I think we can have this by June 9.th

183
00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:35.850
Barnabas: Ideally. 2 weeks after June 9. We could have dinner, too. And that would be basically what would go to Sepulia and Minnet.

184
00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:48.890
stokes: Okay, so does everyone feel comfortable with targeting devnet one for this? Or should we target Devnet 2,

185
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.690
stokes: yeah. Photos.

186
00:28:54.080 --> 00:29:02.999
potuz: Not sure about other teams, but for us, I suspect that June 9 or 2 weeks after is probably the same, because many of us are going to be in Berlin.

187
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:16.370
stokes: Anyone else.

188
00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.120
stokes: Any client teams want to speak to the timing.

189
00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:30.460
ethDreamer (Mark): This.

190
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.659
ethDreamer (Mark): I'm just, I guess, relevant question.

191
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:41.590
ethDreamer (Mark): Do any of the other existing clients besides prison not already have a a

192
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.930
ethDreamer (Mark): a variant of the Beacon State

193
00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:50.729
ethDreamer (Mark): for Fusaka, even though it hasn't changed yet, because I feel like

194
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:53.809
ethDreamer (Mark): those are the clients that would take longer

195
00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:05.010
ethDreamer (Mark): and and like, I guess my intuition is, if it if prison is comfortable by June 9, th

196
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.550
ethDreamer (Mark): and they have to do the extra work that

197
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:14.259
ethDreamer (Mark): other clients would probably be able to do the same thing. But I guess that depends on the load of the client. But

198
00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:15.820
ethDreamer (Mark): yeah.

199
00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:31.169
stokes: Yeah, I think I would say, just to keep velocity high, just of the general process. We would go ahead and aim for devnet one. So we'd Sfi today.

200
00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:37.670
stokes: this would be your chance to raise any concerns with that timeline.

201
00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:57.970
stokes: Yeah, okay, like Barnabas is saying the chat. No one seems to have any issues. So let's do it.

202
00:30:58.610 --> 00:31:01.609
stokes: We'll go ahead and sify this. Today

203
00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:06.840
stokes: we'll target Devnet one. And yeah, we'll keep moving things forward.

204
00:31:07.110 --> 00:31:07.790
stokes: Cool.

205
00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:14.129
stokes: Let me pull up the agenda. Then for the next item.

206
00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:23.109
stokes: Okay, yeah. I had a good. I had this next just to talk about pure dos

207
00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:26.939
stokes: again, because I figured it might inform the dem not one timing.

208
00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:37.849
stokes: There were some more details came up like more issues and or details of Bpo, and also without our custody around the period feature set

209
00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.009
stokes: as people got into implementation.

210
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:43.549
stokes: I wanted to take some time today to resolve those.

211
00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.960
stokes: So with Bpo.

212
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:54.100
stokes: There was, I think a question around this Pr that would like back port this Vpo idea, I believe that's been closed. So I think we're good there.

213
00:31:54.560 --> 00:32:03.169
stokes: There was also a thread of conversation on discord around. How we want to handle Bpo and the context of networking. So

214
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.229
stokes: there is a proposal to

215
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:23.009
stokes: essentially mix in the Bpo schedule into the fork digest, so that this is legible in the networking layer, and this is good because you don't want to have to like necessarily appear with some other node who might be on a different Bpo than you. So it just keeps the networking layer much cleaner.

216
00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:27.549
stokes: There is an also question at that point. If we should touch the fork version

217
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:36.330
stokes: at that point it kind of becomes a hard fork. And this is, I think, really the question here is like, how much of a fork is the Vpo change?

218
00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:37.780
stokes: So

219
00:32:38.603 --> 00:32:44.380
stokes: let's see, I know, Raul, you were here, and you were looking into this. I don't know if anyone else would like to speak to this issue.

220
00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:50.332
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, sure. So I can give some some extra context here. With regards to the port version.

221
00:32:50.690 --> 00:33:10.829
Raúl Kripalani: the key question here is our vpo forks. Given that the change consensus rules are they treated? Should they be treated as protocol forks? That would mean changing the the fork version. The reason why we came. Why I particularly came to the solution was, at the Emr level. Here is our

222
00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:36.479
Raúl Kripalani: indicating what the next fork version is, and this enables fork signaling, and it enables that appearing so. But they're not indicating what the next fork digest would be so kind of like. The natural solution would be to change the fork version. But then, as we kind of like unravel this, there were more and more deeper changes required specifically to make everything work and line up nicely. We would need to patch the recon state as well.

223
00:33:36.874 --> 00:33:59.629
Raúl Kripalani: Which, like, there is, I think, a kind of like a version of the world where that is desirable, because otherwise would end up, I think creating a secondary path for deploying consensus, breaking views with the network without actually representing, representing them as protocol forks, and I don't know what downstream consequences this could have like potentially in libraries and other tools, and so on.

224
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:16.610
Raúl Kripalani: So that's kind of like the the top, the top node in the decision tree. But then, like downstream from that, there were a bunch of other proposals for the signaling. There was a proposal to signal the next fork, the next Bpa. Fork and the status Rpc.

225
00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:30.489
Raúl Kripalani: Request response. In the response. But the issue with that is that you would need to establish a connection with a peer, to then learn whether they're gonna follow the work or not. So this is costly, so still, like the if we decide to not

226
00:34:30.845 --> 00:34:44.075
Raúl Kripalani: represent them as fork versions and just keep them at the at the 4th digest level. Then what I would recommend is adding here to the enr to indicate what the next Vp of work that's gonna be followed is,

227
00:34:44.679 --> 00:34:54.669
Raúl Kripalani: yeah, that's that's kind of like the the 2 different potential plots that we can go. We can go into either changing the 4th version or

228
00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:01.920
Raúl Kripalani: the fork digest, mixing it with the Bpo's, the next Bpo. Schedule entry.

229
00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.510
Raúl Kripalani: together with an enhancement of new E and R.

230
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:09.160
stokes: Cool. Thanks.

231
00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:15.740
stokes: Yeah. My sense here. And I'm very curious. Your client teams take on this. But my sense here is that

232
00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:28.380
stokes: if we make these deeper changes into like fork version. Then, yeah, it's essentially very close to our fork. And yeah, this could be fine, but it seems a little bit too invasive

233
00:35:28.933 --> 00:35:36.270
stokes: fork digest, I think, makes sense for the pairing arguments. And then, yeah, I wonder if there's like some middle ground? I guess you're saying

234
00:35:36.637 --> 00:35:41.590
stokes: you would. If we went with that approach we would do that, but then also add something to the Nr.

235
00:35:42.536 --> 00:35:46.699
stokes: Which is not a big thing, but it is still a thing.

236
00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:48.940
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, it would be pretty complex.

237
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:52.349
stokes: Sorry. What was that? You're a little quiet.

238
00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:58.090
Raúl Kripalani: Would be pretty compact, but at a byte level it would just be a few bytes, so.

239
00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:02.639
stokes: Right? Yeah, I'm I'm thinking, more. Just end implementation and testing that and everything.

240
00:36:03.722 --> 00:36:08.790
stokes: But yeah, any other client teams have any thoughts on how to handle this.

241
00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:27.710
sean: So in in lighthouse like, yeah. Fork version, change is like a bigger deal causes more changes, fork, digest change is more manageable, doable.

242
00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:35.029
stokes: Yeah, okay, Terrence says, same with prism. And that's my sense as well as

243
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:49.629
stokes: that's probably the right way to handle this is, make the change to the fork digest. So again, it's clear from the networking layer. What's going on with all your peers. And yeah, then having the enr, and maybe we'll maybe you could just reiterate like

244
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:53.219
stokes: that just helps you manage this at the discovery layer.

245
00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.410
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, exactly. The enr is necessary to know

246
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:11.990
Raúl Kripalani: to for 2 reasons for signaling and to discover the right peers that you're that are going to be following the next pork as you. The same next pork as you, so you can. You can continue connected to that one to 4 accommodities.

247
00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:15.550
stokes: Right without having to connect and do the whole handshake and everything.

248
00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.740
Raúl Kripalani: Exactly.

249
00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:17.870
stokes: No.

250
00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:20.230
stokes: Okay.

251
00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:32.870
Raúl Kripalani: Cool. So what I'll do is, it seems like consensus is moving in this direction. So I'll do a second version in the second iteration of this Pr and hopefully later today for folks to review hopefully that will resolve the contention here.

252
00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:40.370
stokes: Okay, great. And this was a Pr to the eip or the consensus specs. Or where did this look.

253
00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:45.200
Raúl Kripalani: To the, to, the, to the eip, and from there we can take a to the consensus standard.

254
00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.880
stokes: Alright, everyone on board with this.

255
00:37:54.080 --> 00:38:01.670
stokes: because I think this was the last piece of vpos again. It sounds like we have them already, and like the core functionality, seems like it's working, which is really cool.

256
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:06.149
stokes: At least we'll know soon enough, and then we'll round this out.

257
00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.569
stokes: Were there any other open questions with, Vpos.

258
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.360
stokes: okay, cool.

259
00:38:20.382 --> 00:38:24.540
stokes: Yeah. Thanks for making this updates roll. And great.

260
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.829
stokes: The other thing that I think we should touch on today

261
00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:33.840
stokes: under Pyrados is this notion of validator custody?

262
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:39.840
stokes: So we had the feature, and just like a quick summary, the idea is

263
00:38:40.415 --> 00:38:53.199
stokes: you have additional custody requirements dependent on how much stake you have. So say there's so many validators on a node with this much stake, as there's more stake than you would custody more columns under periodos.

264
00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:56.519
stokes: This helps with network stability and a bunch of nice things.

265
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:09.475
stokes: The complication, I think, as it is right now, is the way the spec is written currently is, it's a very dynamic process where you should basically follow every change to, you know,

266
00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:15.209
stokes: any validators attached. And this is like a dynamic online process.

267
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:22.799
stokes: I think there have been some implementation issues here. And in that case we should decide if we want to do something simpler.

268
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.860
stokes: just to facilitate shipping.

269
00:39:25.270 --> 00:39:33.799
stokes: With this in particular, you only change the custody set you need to reason about, I believe, every 32. Eth. Right? So like per validator.

270
00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:40.555
stokes: And okay, thanks. Sanskar. Okay, we'll circle back to that.

271
00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:53.479
stokes: But yeah, so the point being is, it would be fairly infrequent changes. And so then there's, I think, a pretty good argument to make that. If this is a more static process, it works well enough.

272
00:39:54.511 --> 00:40:04.060
stokes: Yeah, I guess I'd be curious if anyone has run into implementation issues with the current spec, and if they'd like to. Yeah, essentially

273
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:06.469
stokes: propose, we go with the simpler option.

274
00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.019
stokes: any others comment. It's possible the people who are closest to this are not on the call today.

275
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.299
stokes: so we can handle it. Async. But this is definitely something we should sort out in the next like week or 2,

276
00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.550
stokes: cause it's been this like a long running thread.

277
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:38.690
Barnabas: Yeah, I think, yeah, I think we've been basically going back and forth on this or month.

278
00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.460
stokes: Yeah.

279
00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:51.980
stokes: yeah, it's not a bad suggestion. Osgar. Just take it to the testing call Monday. Cause. Yeah, it looks like we don't have the people here today. Okay.

280
00:40:52.250 --> 00:41:00.660
stokes: I will try to follow up on this Async, just so we can get everything organized. And then, yeah, let's sort this out. Monday.

281
00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.850
stokes: Okay, cool.

282
00:41:07.810 --> 00:41:11.050
stokes: Sorry. I was just checking the agenda. So yeah.

283
00:41:11.700 --> 00:41:17.829
stokes: okay, so with that all in place I did want to check in on Devnet one.

284
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:26.119
stokes: I can go grab a link to the specs. But yeah, essentially, just wanted to touch base. If there was anything we needed to resolve. Otherwise

285
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:32.539
stokes: it sounds like we've added 7, 9, 1, 7 to them, that one. So we can make that update.

286
00:41:33.382 --> 00:41:37.510
stokes: Let's see, we can iron out these things with Bpo.

287
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:47.170
stokes: and we'll decide Valerie custody. But it's also framed as an optional thing. So I think if that doesn't make it until done that, too. That's acceptable, at least.

288
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:52.099
stokes: Are there any other things for Devnet? One specs people would like to discuss right now

289
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:01.746
stokes: we feel good about them.

290
00:42:06.410 --> 00:42:07.130
stokes: Okay.

291
00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.030
stokes: was there, do you want to just ask.

292
00:42:15.350 --> 00:42:32.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, I'm just really just curious. Basically for just some sentiment check in terms of are we feeling kind of the focus getting nicely towards a conclusion here, or like, do we do? We? Are we secretly worried? And we might kind of need some extra time like, what's what's the kind of current state of things.

293
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:50.640
stokes: Yeah, maybe a different way to frame this is once we are now things with Devnet 0. Do we feel like Devnet? One will be at least, do we expect them that one to be pretty streamlined on top of that?

294
00:42:50.790 --> 00:42:55.149
stokes: And then from there would that put us in a place where we feel period office is stable.

295
00:42:55.630 --> 00:43:07.009
stokes: The next big thing after that, once we have something we feel like. A stable implementation of peer to us is then to think about scaling the bob count and ironing that out, which I expect will take over the summer.

296
00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.786
stokes: But yeah, the way I've been thinking about it at least, is

297
00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:18.009
stokes: get stable code. Then we essentially move to perf testing around the blog count. And that lines us up for Osaka.

298
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.840
stokes: You know, Terrence says here, after done that one just testing, testing, testing, testing.

299
00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:33.960
stokes: Okay.

300
00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:45.380
stokes: cool. So I think that was all we had for Fusaka. And yeah, thanks everyone I feel like that was pretty streamlined. I think we're making good progress there.

301
00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.190
stokes: So okay.

302
00:43:48.410 --> 00:44:01.219
stokes: the other thing today was Glamsterdam. And yeah, so some of this might be a little different or new, just given this new proposal we have to think around

303
00:44:02.381 --> 00:44:05.120
stokes: or how we think about, you know.

304
00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.500
stokes: scheduling hard forks, pacing them. And all this stuff.

305
00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:19.280
stokes: So we said we'd move to this sort of regime. Now, where this call is essentially focused on fork plus one, we'd have a lot of the core current fork stuff. Go to the testing call.

306
00:44:19.610 --> 00:44:26.229
stokes: So what that means, then, is, we can now open the thread of Glamsterdam, which is the next work for this call.

307
00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.519
stokes: There's a couple of things here. And I mean, yeah, maybe just to get ahead of this.

308
00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:37.260
stokes: I don't think we should make any decisions today around Glamsterdam, but I did want to start to open the conversation

309
00:44:38.523 --> 00:44:45.860
stokes: the framing that Tim had in his proposal, which I thought was pretty nice, is to start by discussing the the focus of the fork. So essentially, you know.

310
00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:54.890
stokes: she lets me and focus on scaling should focus on ux. There's like a number of high level categories we could frame works around

311
00:44:55.713 --> 00:45:00.819
stokes: for what it's worth. I think most people would say that we should focus on scaling for Amsterdam.

312
00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:06.809
stokes: But I do want to leave some room for that conversation again, just to get things started.

313
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:13.180
stokes: After that there were 2 headliners on the Cl. Side. So far that have been proposed for Glamsterdam.

314
00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:18.219
stokes: I invited the authors of those vips to give a short review today.

315
00:45:18.340 --> 00:45:23.089
stokes: And again, the point is not to decide anything. But just to start the conversation.

316
00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:31.699
stokes: And then, yeah, a key bit, I think. Given all that context is for us to start to discuss today.

317
00:45:32.310 --> 00:45:42.810
stokes: What what community input do we need? I think this is something that came up with our scoping of Petra is not being as in sync with the community. And how to think about that.

318
00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.009
stokes: And so yeah, the the thinking is essentially to

319
00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:57.339
stokes: open the conversation today. And then highlight different input, we feel like we're lacking. And then we can move forward on that for future calls.

320
00:45:58.250 --> 00:46:05.740
stokes: So with that context, yeah, Onzgar, you have your hand up so I'll let you speak.

321
00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:27.799
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I just wanted to say that I think it obviously makes sense to kind of talk here, mostly about the Cl side focus and on on acde more about the El side focus. And I think in some ways the Cl side is a bit easier, I think, kind of across the general priorities that I think right now we we seem to want to to have, and of course we can discuss those as well, but I think mostly it's around

322
00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:52.869
Ansgar Dietrichs: well, scaling the l 1 scaling the blobs, making sure that also Ux and things like sensor resistance are in a good place. And so for Glamsterdam. That seems to just very naturally mean we will have to find some ways to continue the blob scaling that probably will already take up a meaningful portion of the attention on the Cl. Side there might be some El side scaling opportunities that will

323
00:46:53.060 --> 00:47:14.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: require Cl. Help. So, for example, epbs, or some sort of delayed execution. Some variants of that would also be Cl side. So basically, Cl might also be able to help with that one thing that I think explicitly, because I think otherwise. Priorities don't make sense. If you don't say what they do not include, I personally think that on the Cl. Side, we've actually been a bit much on the side of

324
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:26.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: focusing around just like features, for the users of the Cl. Users of the Cl. Are mostly stakers. I think over the last 2, 3 years. We've very much focused on delivering kind of just quality of life. Nice to have

325
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:40.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: features there, I would say we should deprioritize that for a while. I think we're in a good place there now, after Max Cb. There are some proposals right around, like reducing the the withdrawal, time and whatnot. I think

326
00:47:40.780 --> 00:48:04.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: these should very much be in the nice to have category like if we end up having room for that in Amsterdam great, but I think that should not be front and center, and the last thing I would also say is because fossil is already one of the proposed ones, and of course you'll hear arguments for that. I think we all agree. Fossil will have to be shipped soon, I would personally say right now, in the moment we're in time I would prioritize scaling, meaning that there are some arguments that fossil is also very crucial for scaling, because it reduces our reliance on

327
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:28.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: solar building for sensory resistance. And so basically making building a bit more heavy is easier to do after we have fossils. So in that sense, fossil is also helping with the scaling. But I think we should basically, for the short term, be pragmatic about. Does it already constitute a bottleneck that we need to address now, otherwise I would personally wait with fossil, for like one or 2 more hard fogs. But yeah, so that's kind of my general mindset for what Glamsterdam should focus on delivering.

328
00:48:31.290 --> 00:48:32.590
stokes: Okay, thanks

329
00:48:34.975 --> 00:48:43.270
stokes: any general comments on focus. Otherwise I think it might be helpful just to get into these headliner proposals to help ground the conversation.

330
00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:52.020
stokes: Okay?

331
00:48:52.830 --> 00:49:01.780
stokes: So then, I just went in order of proposal here. So the 1st one was 7, 7, 3 2 epbs.

332
00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:12.219
stokes: Put us if you'd like to give a short overview, and I guess, frame it. Then in the context of scaling ux these types of fork focuses that

333
00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.730
stokes: I think we want.

334
00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:21.010
potuz: Sure. Let me just share the couple of slides that I used for the protocol call.

335
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:23.340
potuz: Let me see if I can

336
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:27.810
potuz: do I do this? Here? It is.

337
00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:35.639
potuz: Alright. This is just a couple of slides. Most people here already know the mechanism. So I'm not gonna go over that again.

338
00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.029
potuz: I just want to mention quickly what are the scaling properties of epbs?

339
00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:52.629
potuz: it's simple. The Pbs gives you the following, it removes all of the broadcast of the payload and the blobs from the hot path.

340
00:49:53.110 --> 00:50:03.999
potuz: Instead of like having 2 seconds to broadcast the block, the complete block consensus, execution and blobs. You will have now between 8 and 11 seconds.

341
00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:11.149
potuz: and you will have now between 8 and 11 seconds, with the current slot times to broadcast blobs. The whole thing

342
00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:25.429
potuz: bottleneck today for scaling blobs and for scaling in general. The bottleneck today is bandwidth. There's no other bottleneck that gets even close to bandwidth. So these numbers are just huge changes.

343
00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:37.669
potuz: and this is the only eip that achieves this thing of like completely decoupling the payload from the block and completely decoupling the broadcast of the blobs from the validation of the block.

344
00:50:39.050 --> 00:50:53.639
potuz: So that's the major change that the cip gives in terms of scaling. Of course there are other known scaling benefits which move around the trust assumptions on, on, off protocol

345
00:50:54.130 --> 00:50:59.679
potuz: players. But I've been told not to focus on this today. They are written in this slide.

346
00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:03.139
potuz: Let me just go to the next one

347
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:06.279
potuz: and other features that Dps has.

348
00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:18.929
potuz: It's absolutely, trivially composable with other proposals for scaling both on the El and the Cl. And it's easy, because of the mechanism of separating the consensus from execution. Logic.

349
00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:37.349
potuz: once you have different consensus and execution logic, then you can just tackle both sides independently. So compare, what's the complication of including fossil with other proposals for delayed execution? Of course Cpbs gives you delayed execution

350
00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:53.659
potuz: and compare it with the proposal on how to include this, for epbs for epbs, including fossil, is just trivial. It's just a single bit list that needs to go in the bid, including a block access list, is absolutely trivial. It doesn't even affect epbs at all.

351
00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:13.689
potuz: So there's no changes that are needed. Whenever you want to make changes, either purely on the consensus side or purely on the execution side, because the logic is completely coupled. So that's what Dpbs does. It separates the payload from the block, and it makes it simpler to argue about changes on either side

352
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:32.160
potuz: as it stands today. It only involves Cl changes, it does not touch the El at all. It doesn't even touch the execution engine. If you do this correctly, in the sense that when this execution, when the consensus layer gets the block, it doesn't even talk to the El to validate it

353
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:47.209
potuz: at all. There's no even a single message to the local El. It can be tested in isolation because of this change because of this property. So whatever the El is doing in a fork, we can just test epbs separated at that time.

354
00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:57.330
potuz: It's already been. It's already implemented almost completely. But there are some simplifications that aren't included yet, but it's fully implemented in Taek. One prism.

355
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:59.589
potuz: And well, that's it.

356
00:52:59.800 --> 00:53:11.370
potuz: Let me just have this last slide with some questions that people typically complain about. There are many others. But these 3 I like.

357
00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:31.989
potuz: This is one that I get very common. It enshrines a particular type of auction, and it would just like, Give us this tech debt forever. No, there's no auction in epbs, not at all. The proposer can do whatever he wants. 99% of the pip is separating the block from the payload the auction part. It doesn't exist.

358
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:54.700
potuz: What happens is that the payload has to be signed by someone that's just for simplicity, and that can be changed at any time in the future. In fact, all of the proposals that we have for Aps is execution tickets, and so forth. Rely on the separation of the payload from the block. So they rely already on the feature that epbs produces minimally.

359
00:53:55.110 --> 00:54:06.499
potuz: It is not compatible with existing off protocol mechanism. That's that's just purely false epbs is compatible with anything that happens now, because you can continue doing whatever you're doing. Now, if you wish to.

360
00:54:07.150 --> 00:54:20.629
potuz: Epbs just allows you to do in a different way, but you can just still sign your blocks and your payload yourself and trust whomever external builder is going to produce you a payload if you just signed it blindly.

361
00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:38.479
potuz: it increases protocol complexity. No, I think I already argued that it doesn't. It's true that it's not a simple eap to implement. It takes time to implement on the consensus side, but it actually simplifies the protocol itself. It simplifies it because it separates the concerns of the consensus and the execution.

362
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:53.249
potuz: If you want to read more, these are resources. The 1st 2 are just non-technical, exactly in the same tense that I talked today, and the last one has more than what you wish to to look for on the technical side.

363
00:54:57.570 --> 00:55:06.279
stokes: Cool. Yeah, thanks for the review. So yeah, I think in summary, like, if the framing of Amsterdam in terms of fork focus is scaling.

364
00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:10.280
stokes: Yeah, the argument here is like Pps gives us these pipelining benefits.

365
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:10.680
lightclient: That's.

366
00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.069
stokes: Directly helps us scale.

367
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:17.219
stokes: I don't know if there are other questions from that.

368
00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:25.670
stokes: I did have one question. I believe there's given the way we separate the execution payload from the consensus block.

369
00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:34.179
stokes: There is some impact on how transaction inclusion, latency would be perceived effectively adding a delay.

370
00:55:34.550 --> 00:55:36.169
stokes: Could you speak to that a little bit.

371
00:55:38.090 --> 00:55:42.440
potuz: I'm sorry. Oh, oh, the delay of including execution is including transactions.

372
00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:43.410
stokes: Right.

373
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:58.099
potuz: Yes. So this is definitely an issue. So the issue here is, the following is, if you're sending a transaction today, the builder can produce can include it right at the moment that you're that you're sending it

374
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:05.800
potuz: with the Pbs. There is a delay between what the proposal the proposer has committed to a blog.

375
00:56:05.830 --> 00:56:31.889
potuz: and that block is not revealed yet. However, this delay we're looking into like making the slot shorter, and we believe that we can push this delay to about like one second 1.5 seconds. We have been doing experiments with 6 MB blocks, and they show that we can actually squeeze the time in which the builder has to reveal their payload.

376
00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.829
stokes: Okay. Thank you.

377
00:56:41.830 --> 00:56:42.220
potuz: Party.

378
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:42.730
stokes: How's it going.

379
00:56:42.730 --> 00:56:47.549
potuz: Question about 4 choice. I don't know if you wanted to mention there he is.

380
00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.650
stokes: Rolling. Yeah.

381
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:54.709
potuz: There is. And this is something that people typically ask about. And it's scary, because.

382
00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:58.619
potuz: frankly, because most people don't know what 4 choice is on ethereum.

383
00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:28.160
potuz: and there are a few that actually do know. And they have this concern. And I agree any touch on 4 choice is important, but most of our bugs have not been on 4 choice. Most of the bugs that we have seen, and the important security concerns that we've had had been around the execution engine, and actually the non separation of the consensus and the execution. However, there is a minimal change to 4 choice. The change to 4 choice is that now

384
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:48.429
potuz: today you have a node in 4 choice means that you've seen a block, a consensus block and an execution block, and with the Pbs. A node in 4 choice would mean 3 different things. Either you've seen the consensus and the execution block, or you've seen only the consensus block, or you haven't seen anything.

385
00:57:48.720 --> 00:58:02.739
potuz: So there's this one new feature that you need to account for that a consensus block might have come without a payload that was revealed. But that's the only change. We still rely on proposal boost in the same way as today to

386
00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:16.840
potuz: to enforce the security of the builder and of the proposer. And there's a little mechanism of merge view that I don't want to get into details today. But that's just very minor, which is just counting attestations from the Btc.

387
00:58:19.110 --> 00:58:22.830
stokes: Right and just to clarify. There would be then like 2 proposer boost.

388
00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:25.009
stokes: because you'd have one for the 1st round, and then.

389
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:32.549
potuz: No, there's only no, there's only one. There's no changes to fortress today except the node mechanism that I said

390
00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:38.140
potuz: so. There's only one proposal boost that enforces that the consensus block was there.

391
00:58:38.490 --> 00:58:48.510
potuz: and the builder can actually overload the existence of that boost to not to not produce his own block

392
00:58:48.670 --> 00:59:05.850
potuz: his own payload. There's no changes to 4 choice except this fact that attestations that are tested for a block that did not support the payload then don't count for the full node that has the consensus block and the payload in it.

393
00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:08.290
stokes: Got it.

394
00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:10.120
stokes: Okay?

395
00:59:11.022 --> 00:59:27.467
stokes: And yeah, in terms of process, I will elevate this comment from Onsgar. That essentially, I think now, the framing is to just have an intro to these different proposals we will get, I think, much deeper into the weeds later on in the process.

396
00:59:28.250 --> 00:59:35.860
stokes: So we'd probably then, at that point, want to get deeply into like pros and cons and start, you know, weighing different eips against each other

397
00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:41.129
stokes: today, I just wanted to open the conversation. So yeah, let's just keep that in mind.

398
00:59:42.233 --> 00:59:49.040
stokes: You did mention Potus. There are 2 cl clients who have implemented it. I would assume prism. And what was the other one.

399
00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:51.450
potuz: Teku.

400
00:59:51.590 --> 00:59:59.159
potuz: We had finalizing, and that that accelerated the process quite a bit. Once you have more than one client is very simple to start testing.

401
01:00:01.770 --> 01:00:03.540
stokes: Alright cool.

402
01:00:03.810 --> 01:00:05.569
stokes: Yeah. Thanks for the overview.

403
01:00:06.493 --> 01:00:14.090
stokes: Unless there are other questions for that, I think we'll then turn to the next proposal we have on the Cl side, which is fossil.

404
01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:16.950
stokes: let's see, is tomorrow on a call.

405
01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.070
soispoke: Yup down here.

406
01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.279
stokes: Okay, yeah, take it away.

407
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:25.620
soispoke: Thank you.

408
01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:28.489
soispoke: Can you guys see the presentation.

409
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:29.720
stokes: Yep.

410
01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:45.320
soispoke: Yeah, Hi, everyone. So yeah, I'm and I'm actually very happy to make the case for 8. 0, 5

411
01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.609
soispoke: as a headliner for for Amsterdam.

412
01:00:49.310 --> 01:01:11.859
soispoke: So yeah, I thought I would just start by the explained 5 sort of prompt fossil. What fossil does is basically improving ethereum's censorship resistance? And it does so by enabling multiple validators to ensure that any transaction valid according to the protocol rules is included in ethereum blocks.

413
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:23.539
soispoke: so it does this by having multiple validators that build inclusion lists and impose constraints on the sophisticated builders that we have today.

414
01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:48.130
soispoke: I am going to go through the mechanism real fast, just in case there are like 3 very simple steps that are important to keep in mind. The 1st step is about building and broadcasting the inclusion lists. So it's like you have 16 validators that are randomly selected to become Il committee members or includers.

415
01:01:49.380 --> 01:02:05.600
soispoke: and each of them basically monitors, the main pool, and includes like transactions that are comp pending in the public main pool. In their inclusion list up to 8 kB, which is like around 40 transactions per inclusion list. If if you take the median transaction size.

416
01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:12.160
soispoke: and then you the broadcast broadcast, their inclusion list over the shared between network.

417
01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:27.460
soispoke: And what validators do is they monitor the P. 2 P. Network, and they store the inclusion lists that are broadcast until a deadline. That's the view. Freeze deadline that, and that's 9 seconds into the start.

418
01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:33.560
soispoke: And so at this point they keep forwarding like inclusion lists, but they stop storing new ones.

419
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:42.930
soispoke: Then the second step that's very important is about the builder, that is, including Inclusion List transactions in its block.

420
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:52.809
soispoke: And so what the builder does is it also collects and store the inclusion lists, but it actually has additional time after the view. Freeze deadline

421
01:02:53.245 --> 01:03:00.920
soispoke: just to make sure, like there is enough time for the builder to see all the available inclusion lists that were broadcast by the committee members.

422
01:03:02.330 --> 01:03:18.870
soispoke: and so 11 seconds into the slot. The builder, just like, takes the union of transactions across all its stored inclusion lists and then include them in the execution payload before the full block is just like proposed to the rest of the network by the proposal.

423
01:03:20.555 --> 01:03:40.609
soispoke: And in the last step that's like the enforcement step. Attesters also take the union of transactions from Inclusion list they sold according to like their local view, until the view freeze deadline, and they check whether all these transactions were actually included in the block execution payload by the builder.

424
01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:46.220
soispoke: This is where the folk choice enforced comes from. It's like

425
01:03:46.310 --> 01:03:57.250
soispoke: a testers will basically only vote for the block if it satisfies inclusionist conditions according to their local view. So that's the mechanism.

426
01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:25.110
soispoke: I want to briefly talk about some fossil properties the 1st one is that inclusion list, and the payload can be built in parallel, like during the same slot, which is sort of nice and they only need to be merged towards the end of the slot. And that provides real time, censorship, resistance, which is one thing we like. The second part is like we actually have multiple

427
01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:32.417
soispoke: inclusion is proposals like, that's a very cool and central design consideration, and that allows to

428
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:40.609
soispoke: be quite robust to commitment tax. But it also gets us like a very nice one out of N honesty assumption.

429
01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:52.889
soispoke: and what it means like, we only need one Il committee member to build its inclusion list honestly and include transactions from the main pool without censoring for the whole mechanism to work properly.

430
01:04:53.582 --> 01:05:03.469
soispoke: And the conditional property means that the builder must include all the I transactions until the block is, unless the block is full sorry

431
01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:13.119
soispoke: and the builder is also not constrained on where inclusionist transaction transactions are included in the block or their order.

432
01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:21.950
soispoke: And these 2, like last properties, are like, quite important, just to like prevent inclusion list from being crowded out by Mev transactions

433
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:48.399
soispoke: like, imagine if there is like dedicated additional block space, that is for Il transactions, and that will have to be included like I don't know. At the top of the block, or at the end of the block, we might, we will probably see, like some something like an il boost sort of thing emerge where like, you try to sort of like, include your valuable transactions but using il block space. And so

434
01:05:48.530 --> 01:06:08.190
soispoke: in fossil right now, we avoid this, because the Inclusion List transactions have no ordering guarantees, and they must be created before the builder actually builds the block. They are broadcast publicly. So there is really no point in trying to include your transactions with the fossil.

435
01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:18.789
soispoke: Why, it matters well, I I think it's kind of a useful like. Censorship. Resistance is sort of like a core ethereum value. And today we have

436
01:06:18.900 --> 01:06:23.830
soispoke: more than 80% of all blocks that are produced by like just 2 builders.

437
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:33.230
soispoke: And yeah, it's important to keep in mind that these 2 visitors can arbitrarily decide whether to include or exclude transactions from like most of ethereum blocks.

438
01:06:33.350 --> 01:06:51.229
soispoke: And just by looking at the data you can see like these huge fluctuations in builder censorship. And that's just caused by like one or 2 builders that just suddenly decided to censor more or less based on like the fluctuations of their policies.

439
01:06:51.370 --> 01:07:09.270
soispoke: So what fossil does is like? It actually fixes this by giving power, sort of like back to the more decentralized set of validators to enforce inclusion constraints on builders, basically, and that restores fairness and ensures that theorems remain pretty neutral

440
01:07:10.484 --> 01:07:33.865
soispoke: who it benefits, or I I think it's sort of like clear that it benefits, like all users, by ensuring, like their transactions are just included on chain in a timely manner as long as the network is that congested and without having to rely on like those 2 centralized entities, to not censor them. So I think it's like a big ux thing.

441
01:07:34.530 --> 01:07:41.590
soispoke: and the primary benefits. I think the 1st one is obvious. The second one is actually sort of very interesting, because

442
01:07:41.810 --> 01:07:48.340
soispoke: it allows to scale ethereum without having to impose the constraints on the local blockbuilders.

443
01:07:48.440 --> 01:08:14.400
soispoke: The idea there is like, if you allow validators with fossil to independently enforce transaction inclusion. Then it's a major step towards scaling ethereum throughput because it removes the dependency you have on local builders to preserve censorship resistance at the cost of performance and incentive, and I linked it there. But there is a really good article by Barnaby that goes into more details on this.

444
01:08:14.822 --> 01:08:19.479
soispoke: But there are all these like the improved yeah. Ux that I talked about.

445
01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.939
soispoke: I think when your transaction is sent for today, you have to

446
01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:37.460
soispoke: wait for quite a long time like 7 to 8 bucks, I think. And enforce. You know that that actually drastically reduces the the time to inclusion for transactions that might be sensible. So it is an a improvement.

447
01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:54.079
soispoke: Yeah. So I I think it does like fit quite well with the the ethereum priorities. in terms of I mean it. It. Both are all scaling, and it improves ux so. But that's my perspective. I'm obviously a bit biased.

448
01:08:54.456 --> 01:09:21.159
soispoke: It doesn't scale blobs, so it doesn't like do 3 out of 3. But you know 2 is quite good and a a secondary benefit. That was also brought to me recently. And it's kind of enable. It's nice, like it might actually allow some optimistic roll-ups to shorten the challenge period from 7 days to 2, 3 days. If their Tbs is not too big, but like it's, it's still like a an interesting

449
01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:23.924
soispoke: benefit, I guess.

450
01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:27.516
soispoke: Yeah, I'll just go on. Why, now?

451
01:09:28.279 --> 01:09:42.989
soispoke: I think. Yeah, we've been talking about having is, and like better solutions for censorship resistance. For a while. The builder market is inherently centralized just because of like the Mev and the private order flow dynamics. So

452
01:09:43.598 --> 01:10:10.500
soispoke: I don't think that will change like anytime soon. And, on the contrary. Basically, we've observed, like increasing vertical integration across builders and relays and socials over time. So it's not like looking like it's going into in a super nice direction to be. To be honest, I think, observing how fossil behaves on Mainnet is actually also important to us to make decisions on future local changes. We might want to make

453
01:10:10.891 --> 01:10:33.889
soispoke: for example, like this new idea of like delayed execution with Dkvms. I will. I forgot the link, but I will put it to it is like depending on, like the same view merge mechanism we use for fossil. So it would be nice to see it live on Mainnet and that will inform us on how to to deal with other proposals that are important for future upgrades. We need also fossil to

454
01:10:34.010 --> 01:10:36.359
soispoke: to to ship a case, in in my opinion.

455
01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:52.469
soispoke: And then a very important for why, now I think it, and it's always like understated. But like we are like quite lucky that there is not that much censorship going on on the network right now at the protocol level?

456
01:10:52.880 --> 01:11:12.910
soispoke: and if we wait and things change, and and they can like it could actually make protocol level changes to improve censorship, resistance a lot more difficult to coordinate and adapt. And I think that's a point that needs to be taken into consideration in like the sort of urgency in shipping fossil.

457
01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:26.650
soispoke: And then I'll just finish by the technical readiness. Yeah, so 1st of all, 1st of all, is like the result of like multiple years of research on inclusion list, multiple proposals, new merge mechanism, and and so on.

458
01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:44.000
soispoke: It's now working and like, implemented on, on different clients. 5 clients have worked on it. And it's actually successfully runs on a local with prism loadstar teku and get interoperability.

459
01:11:44.070 --> 01:12:12.910
soispoke: We are now working on the spec test for both the Cl. And the El. We've had 11 possible breakout sessions that have been like, at least for me, like very, very nice and useful and we address like sort of like security concerns around il equivocation. And so there was actually a problem in like a previous eip that was about inclusion lists. We've made sure it's also compatible with account, abstraction, delayed execution, epbs, blocks.

460
01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.339
soispoke: access blockable access lists, and and other like proposals

461
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:19.432
soispoke: on the El and Cl. Side

462
01:12:20.396 --> 01:12:34.859
soispoke: and you can go on Meetforcil dot e dot limo. It's a censorship resistance web website that's using Ens and Ipfs, and there you can find, like an actual update

463
01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:46.370
soispoke: on progress on the implementation side of things, but also like all the resources that are like useful for Fosso, both for, like the current proposal, but also like research directions and everything.

464
01:12:47.166 --> 01:13:03.099
soispoke: Thanks. That's it for me. Thanks. Yeah, thanks a lot to all the co-authors, and but also, like all the client devs and contributors that have worked on this so far. It's been super nice to work with all of you, and that's it for me.

465
01:13:05.890 --> 01:13:07.570
stokes: Great thanks for the review.

466
01:13:08.454 --> 01:13:18.450
stokes: Yeah. So you know, going with this focus or this framing of the focus of Amsterdam as some combination of scaling and ux, then, yeah, we have fossil that

467
01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:23.090
stokes: fits into that category. So, okay.

468
01:13:24.055 --> 01:13:27.859
stokes: any questions, I guess, to close out the segment on fossil.

469
01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.610
stokes: Okay, I think your hand was up for a split second.

470
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:42.780
stokes: Well, that was.

471
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:46.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: Just for comment. I just wanted to say that, like, in a way, it's almost like

472
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:48.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: we should also not over focus on these

473
01:13:48.620 --> 01:14:10.989
Ansgar Dietrichs: these focus areas, right? Like, I think the reason like, I think some people in chat were a bit amused that basically, like fossil, is now being presented as a ux and a scaling benefit. I think it is both, but it is much more crucially also delivering to one of like delivering one of ethereum's core values. And I think it's much more justified through that, like sensitive resistance is at the very core of what ethereum is all about. And one of the core things that also

474
01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:24.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: delivers for L. 2 s. And for everything right? And I think it doesn't need justification through these shorter term focus areas. I think the only the main reason why it is useful to have that conversation. How much does it also help with Ux? How much does it also help with scaling is

475
01:14:24.660 --> 01:14:26.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: to ask the question.

476
01:14:26.210 --> 01:14:43.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: do we need to have that in the next fork? Or is it more? Something that we need to like slot in at the next convenient time. So I still think that conversation we should have once we kind of actually determine the scope of Amsterdam in a month or so. But I just wanted to mention right? Just like this is crucial to the future of ethereum. Definitely, I think we all agree on that.

477
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:47.199
stokes: Right? Yeah. And you know.

478
01:14:47.330 --> 01:14:54.220
stokes: it's, I think, perfectly fine to say that Cr is a focus of a fork, at least as a general statement.

479
01:14:54.928 --> 01:15:01.789
stokes: So we don't need to like gradually stick to just scaling or just ux, as like these, only options for the glen focus.

480
01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:03.680
stokes: Yeah, tomorrow.

481
01:15:05.170 --> 01:15:24.465
soispoke: Yeah, yeah, I I just want to agree fully, like the I don't want to like make it seem like, it's as important for like scaling and and ux, or like, just like going through these lenses as it is for some social resistance. It's it's mostly definitely like a proposal force and social resistance.

482
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:54.420
soispoke: and I think it's like also interesting, because it can lead to these like pretty big improvements, in my opinion, in the future, and like in in scaling, which is interesting to think about. But yeah, I I didn't mean to like sell it as like a scaling eip. I don't think I want to do that, and I don't think it's it's fair. It's like it is a sensorship resistance, eip, and the argument. I think the the more convincing argument for me of why it should be included rather

483
01:15:54.510 --> 01:16:15.260
soispoke: like sooner than later is more about like the we don't know how censorship is gonna evolve on the network. And that's the part that worries me the most not like. Oh, we need to get fossil in because it's gonna unlock like a ton of skating. That's not what the where the urgency is, at least for me personally.

484
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:19.850
stokes: Makes sense. Thanks.

485
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:30.690
stokes: Okay. Then, I think the other thing for today, I did want to try to start building the muscle memory of thinking about getting input from different parts of the community.

486
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:44.330
stokes: So yeah, I assume this is a conversation that will probably also be informed by the execution layer. But assuming, then, we have this focus on scaling, possibly ux.

487
01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:53.040
stokes: maybe cr for Glamsterdam. Then, yeah, I think either of these headliners could make sense in that framing.

488
01:16:53.250 --> 01:17:00.050
stokes: One thing that we've historically, I think, lacked quite a bit is again input from the broader community. So

489
01:17:00.310 --> 01:17:06.910
stokes: I wanted to take some time to discuss and to make it concrete. We can focus on these 2 eips today.

490
01:17:07.485 --> 01:17:08.910
stokes: And just yeah.

491
01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:15.250
stokes: start to start to highlight who you'd want to get input from to help inform the scoping discussion.

492
01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:20.799
stokes: So off the top of my head right now, I think we could pretty easily say that with Upps.

493
01:17:21.316 --> 01:17:31.019
stokes: There are a number of comments here that we're speaking to different people in the Mev ecosystem. So I think we should try to incorporate their input.

494
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:33.860
stokes: And then, yeah, fossil.

495
01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:46.799
stokes: it's kind of a pretty broad set, simply just because it's all users of ethereum. But yeah, we mentioned roll ups. And yeah, I think there are a number of people we could incorporate there.

496
01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:48.910
stokes: And

497
01:17:50.431 --> 01:17:56.449
stokes: let's see, I was just looking at Tim's comment. Here, I think we should assume there will be more. I I don't know.

498
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:59.420
Tim Beiko: More candidates. Cl, head headliners.

499
01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.719
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Barnabas was asking the question.

500
01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:03.780
stokes: Okay.

501
01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:12.399
stokes: right? So yeah, this is again, I just wanted to start the conversation. Today. I assume there'll be more and we'll cover them in future calls

502
01:18:13.676 --> 01:18:18.419
stokes: but yeah, okay, Nixo has a nice cloud here to solo state grocery Pbs.

503
01:18:20.210 --> 01:18:21.440
chanderprakash sharma: Can I ask one question?

504
01:18:23.450 --> 01:18:23.900
stokes: Sure!

505
01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.100
chanderprakash sharma: Yeah.

506
01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:46.080
chanderprakash sharma: so like, as we are implementing thinking about implementing epbs for the ethereum cl. So if we think at the privacy level in because the future roadmap of ethereum is going to be the privacy level. So what are the impacts? It can like to the core protocol have any idea about it?

507
01:18:50.086 --> 01:18:52.269
stokes: The question was, core impacts

508
01:18:52.690 --> 01:18:55.100
stokes: or impact to the core protocol from apbs.

509
01:18:56.351 --> 01:19:12.870
chanderprakash sharma: No question was that like epbs is just like another way of the sensors of resistance compared to other mechanism. So my question is that like, if we, if we encrypt the for example, we are encrypting the blocks and transaction end to end.

510
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:14.949
potuz: I can probably take. I'm not.

511
01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:29.260
potuz: I can probably take this. Justin here might be probably a better person, but I think that all of these primitives for encrypted mempoles already rely on some sort of separation, on some sort of delayed execution.

512
01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:40.479
potuz: An epbs gives you this, so it's tangential. But I think all of the private mempool mechanisms get only stronger when you have delayed execution.

513
01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:43.080
chanderprakash sharma: Okay. Thank you.

514
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:51.980
stokes: Okay, thanks.

515
01:19:52.924 --> 01:20:02.669
stokes: Onsgar has an interesting take here that essentially the strive for community input should be more of an El focus than a Cl focus. I think we can debate that.

516
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:06.169
stokes: I don't know if you had something to add to that, Anzar.

517
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:14.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: No, I mean, of course. Also, we should try it everywhere. I'm just saying I think it's more important on the Yale side, or more of a liking thing on the Yale side.

518
01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:19.620
stokes: Gotcha? Oh, yeah. Potus.

519
01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:30.000
potuz: I think the I mean we have this this idea, that scaling the El means scaling the protocol, and then this the separation of the El and the Cl. But

520
01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:44.300
potuz: we see that one of our biggest bottleneck is networking and scaling. The Cl. Does affect this. So it's very hard to separate this. And we can actually talk about scaling vips on the Cl call.

521
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:55.269
stokes: Yeah. And I guess the general comment, there is as we get closer to a final Glamsterdam scope.

522
01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.719
stokes: you know. I think we will need to

523
01:20:58.090 --> 01:21:05.399
stokes: take these things together. We can't just say, Oh, the sales over here, the else over there, and they just are working off in a vacuum.

524
01:21:05.710 --> 01:21:14.229
stokes: especially given the nature of. Yeah, I think all of these vips we've discussed today have at least some impact on both layers. So

525
01:21:14.510 --> 01:21:18.939
stokes: we will eventually need to take them in consideration. At the same time.

526
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:34.680
chanderprakash sharma: Stocks. I have one request to you. I already mailed to Tim also, and you about like I like, recently joined the core protocol meetings because I was working on layer 2 protocols. Our paper is coming very soon

527
01:21:35.417 --> 01:21:50.039
chanderprakash sharma: so I have one to guess like where the meetings of the all rank. It's fine, because I also discovered the project management repo. But I did not find then I lately find in the discord. So there is a so many channels for it.

528
01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:53.670
chanderprakash sharma: so could you please approve like I got the meeting link in.

529
01:21:57.531 --> 01:22:03.269
stokes: Yeah, I couldn't quite hear you. I think you're asking where you could find information about the Acd meetings.

530
01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.352
chanderprakash sharma: Yeah, actually like

531
01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:20.379
chanderprakash sharma: I mail regarding it like as I read the report, like, I have to mail either the team or you stop about like to join the meeting. But actually I did not find any meeting link there, it only showing like there is the meeting in the calendar.

532
01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:37.580
chanderprakash sharma: But there is a no end meeting link, but fortunately I find through the discord. But many of the time I forgot to join, because the. There is the meeting link in your present in the my Google Calendar. So could you share the calendar or provide me permission to join that.

533
01:22:39.430 --> 01:22:50.970
stokes: Yeah, well, it sounds like you've discovered the process. So yeah, we have agendas in the Pm repo that you've mentioned. And then also, yeah, the meeting information share on discord.

534
01:22:51.570 --> 01:22:57.870
stokes: So yeah, my email is in the agenda. So if you would like to follow up.

535
01:22:58.120 --> 01:22:59.980
stokes: let's just take this offline.

536
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:07.530
stokes: Oh, yeah, I'm in fang.

537
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:15.659
Mingfei Zhang: Is there some time left for me to present my vip like 12 min.

538
01:23:16.330 --> 01:23:21.990
Mingfei Zhang: so I want to make it in a headline in the next folk hard, hard folk.

539
01:23:24.710 --> 01:23:35.749
stokes: Yeah. So I replied, on the agenda about this the way we're thinking about this now is having this process for headliner proposals. So I think ideally, you would have

540
01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:43.139
stokes: I post on these magicians that proposes the headliner. If that fits the scope, and then we could cover in a future call.

541
01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:46.050
Mingfei Zhang: Okay, okay, that's cool.

542
01:23:48.290 --> 01:23:49.410
stokes: Okay, thanks.

543
01:23:51.438 --> 01:23:54.579
stokes: Okay, let's skip back on topic. So

544
01:23:54.750 --> 01:24:03.139
stokes: I did want to highlight different parts of the community that I think we should try to get input from, as we inform the scope discussion.

545
01:24:03.510 --> 01:24:09.459
stokes: And let's see. So we have different map ecosystem people, free Pbs, solo stakers there.

546
01:24:10.347 --> 01:24:13.869
stokes: Probably generally validators across the board.

547
01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:18.620
stokes: And yeah, anything anyone wants to call out for fossil.

548
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:23.959
stokes: I think that would generally just be everyone.

549
01:24:24.910 --> 01:24:28.459
stokes: so that might be a harder set to get a concrete representation of

550
01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:42.500
stokes: okay?

551
01:24:43.185 --> 01:24:54.080
stokes: Yeah, I'll think about how we can get again concrete input from these different parties and incorporate them into future calls, as we continue the Glamsterdam scoping conversation.

552
01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:59.599
stokes: And with that let me just double check.

553
01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:06.450
stokes: Oh, there was a okay, I guess I'll just call this out there's a poll here for the H. Star name

554
01:25:06.870 --> 01:25:08.910
stokes: for the upgrade after Glamsterdam.

555
01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:11.200
stokes: Let me just grab a link here.

556
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:19.859
stokes: There's this post on Ethan magicians. So yeah, if you would like to chime in, you can do so there.

557
01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:29.370
stokes: And okay, yeah, I mean, okay, I see your comments here. I'll follow up with you after this.

558
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:33.960
stokes: But yeah, otherwise, I think that was essentially everything on the agenda today.

559
01:25:34.330 --> 01:25:41.150
stokes: And yeah, unless there are any other comments? Then I will go ahead and say, we can wrap up early.

560
01:25:42.850 --> 01:25:59.629
stokes: yeah, I guess. Generally, just yeah. Be thinking about the different points made today around Glamsterdam, continue thinking about the the framing of the fork, and like, what are the sort of core properties we want to focus on. And yeah, I think, well, maybe I won't speak to next week. But

561
01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:07.219
stokes: yeah, point being is, we will continue the conversation. And yeah, get to a Glamsterdam.

562
01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.389
stokes: Okay? Unless there's anything else. Let's go ahead and wrap up today.

563
01:26:15.140 --> 01:26:16.170
ethDreamer (Mark): Thanks guys.

564
01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:17.390
soispoke: Thanks.

565
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:18.869
soispoke: Okay. Thanks. Everyone.

566
01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:19.880
stokes: See you next time.

567
01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.070
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thanks. Ron bye.

568
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:25.699
chanderprakash sharma: Thank you, everyone. Bye-bye.

569
01:26:27.700 --> 01:26:28.510
potuz: Bye-bye.
