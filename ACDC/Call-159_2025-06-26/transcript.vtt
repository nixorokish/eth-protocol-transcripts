00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.459
Ansgar Dietrichs: Hello! Everyone. Welcome to episode 2 of my experiment in ethereum governance, capture.

2
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.089
Anders Kristiansen: Let's see ya, it's good now.

3
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: Beach the Gulf Golf unless I think you should be muted.

4
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:10.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: Hello! Hello! Let's give it a few more seconds for people to trickle in, Josh. I assume I should let you know again when we want to go. Live.

5
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.599
Josh Davis: Yeah, just let me know when you're ready to start.

6
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.326
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good.

7
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.779
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. I mean, maybe

8
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: we can just get going. I think we have possibly a long agenda to go through. I'm not sure how long it will be, so let's let's go live.

9
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.200
Josh Davis: I knew when you are. You're alive.

10
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:48.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Yeah. Hi, everyone. To the to Acdc today I'm filling in for Alex, who will be back for next Acdc.

11
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah.

12
00:06:51.260 --> 00:07:04.709
Ansgar Dietrichs: we I am. I also guest hosted last week's acde. I'm a little bit less familiar with, intimately familiar with the Acdc topic. So if I kind of make any mistakes, something feel free to just jump in and correct me on anything.

13
00:07:05.368 --> 00:07:08.369
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, let's let's get started. I'll

14
00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: put the link to the agenda in zoom chat M.

15
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:26.670
Ansgar Dietrichs: So 1st up, we wanted to talk about Fusaka for most of today's call, and the 1st topic there is Devnet, 2 Barnabas, I think, wanted to give a status update of where we are at there with the launch.

16
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:44.530
Barnabas: Yeah, sure. So this morning at 10 Am. Utc, we have launched 2. We scheduled to be hit tomorrow around the same time in epoch 256. And then we're going to do a Bpo

17
00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:49.340
Barnabas: every other day. Basically, we're gonna do every other

18
00:07:50.720 --> 00:08:02.000
Barnabas: epoch. 2, 56 is going to be a Bpo change. I have put in the interrupt channel the exact schedule. We're gonna go up. We're gonna go down and we're gonna go up again

19
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:15.980
Barnabas: till we hit next blocks of 20. So far the network looks very stable this morning. I have raised some Cl questions regarding Nfd values and Cgc values and

20
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:35.119
Barnabas: those fixes seem to have came in except for Nimbus, that is still, have a incorrect nft value. But I'm sure nimbus team is already looking into it also. On the nimbus side we seem to have some empty blocks produced by Nimbu.

21
00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.220
Barnabas: and they are also looking into that

22
00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:41.220
Barnabas: that's about it, for now.

23
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:51.400
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Any any other topics on Devnet 2 or any action items we need to get to on on that topic specifically.

24
00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:03.106
Barnabas: So hopefully, you're gonna be able to test everything, including checkpoint syncing and verifying the new status messages. And

25
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.090
Barnabas: yeah, I'm looking forward to that.

26
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:10.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good.

27
00:09:11.061 --> 00:09:37.888
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. Then, onto the next topic. General Ps, updates, they are just the one thing I wanted to briefly get to is on acdt on Monday. We briefly had the announcement of a new Sunset Labs report, but people hadn't really had time yet to have a look, so there wasn't really much discussion. So I just wanted to give it some room again today in case there was any follow up anything people would want to briefly talk about

28
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:46.380
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, I'm not sure. I think we have someone from from Sunnyside labs on the call as well. If you want to say a few words on just the headline, Findings.

29
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:58.409
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah. Hi, so regarding the network bandwidth limits, network bandwidth. We retested with 8 validators.

30
00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:05.187
J Sunnyside Labs: as Barnabas pointed out from the acd call, and we found

31
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:12.680
J Sunnyside Labs: much less bandwidth usage by prison, and we will retest

32
00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:21.589
J Sunnyside Labs: all the other ceos with def net 2 spec. Once devnet 2 is stabilizes. So

33
00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.189
J Sunnyside Labs: yeah, we will give you guys more updates on this.

34
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:37.869
J Sunnyside Labs: And also we've contacted at least one person from every Cl teams if they need something. So please let us know. Then we can run like

35
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:44.089
J Sunnyside Labs: or prepare something for individual teams upon request.

36
00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.440
J Sunnyside Labs: Yep, thank you.

37
00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:53.530
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thanks. Were there any comments at Barnabas? Yeah.

38
00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:58.260
Barnabas: Not regarding this, but regarding the net too.

39
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, sorry. Yeah. Then. Yeah. Let's proceed.

40
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: Go back to that. Then.

41
00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:16.560
Barnabas: Yeah. So I've quickly enabled watchtower on the 2. So this means that if you push a new commit to your existing branch for like a 2 branch

42
00:11:17.084 --> 00:11:22.215
Barnabas: and we trigger an automatic image build, we will automatically pull the images

43
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.929
Barnabas: every 2Â min. We're gonna be checking. If there's a new docker image available.

44
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:35.990
Barnabas: So in case you push now something to the branch that is untested, or something that's broken that might take your entire

45
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:37.760
Barnabas: find offline.

46
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:54.070
ethDreamer (Mark): Just wanna ask if cause Cp doesn't have that branch. But you're saying, if I if we make one, that we can continue to iterate on that. And it will be built automatically. Okay.

47
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.670
Barnabas: Yes.

48
00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:18.738
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Then to come briefly back to the Sunnyside labs. point! Was there anyone who maybe also, or had a look or any any follow up questions or comments regarding the report for Monday. Anything more on this topic.

49
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:24.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: otherwise.

50
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:35.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: are there any general like? We have a few concrete updates to go through in a second open Prs and discussion of Bpo strategy and and spec freeze. But before that, any general kind of Ps testing updates.

51
00:12:46.810 --> 00:13:13.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay? I mean, I assume, just like everyone was waiting for Devnet to. Okay, then let's go to the specifics. We have a few open Prs. We wanted to talk about. Justin had put them into a comment on the agenda. Let me briefly link that that was 5 open Prs. Although the last one is not specific to Fusaka, so we'll talk about that separately in the section afterwards. So it's only the 1st 4 here that we will want to briefly talk about here.

52
00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:30.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: basically just to make a decision ideally today, on like whether to merge or close them. Yeah, I'll just go through through the 4 of them. So the 1st 1, 4, 3, 9, 3 by Anish from Nimbus, I think. If you're on the call

53
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: to briefly talk about this.

54
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:42.410
Dustin: I don't know if Agnesha's I'm

55
00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:45.879
Dustin: I'm here. I'm on the call. It is Agnesia's Pr.

56
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:49.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: Since. Yeah, if you have the context on this then that would be great. Yeah.

57
00:13:52.050 --> 00:14:00.040
Dustin: Sure. So I believe this. This is the one where it removes the the pure, pure sampling, and

58
00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.589
Dustin: like correct me if I'm wrong. Because that's why I'm gonna that's that's my back. And

59
00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:20.340
Dustin: so the idea is, peer sampling was an earlier iteration of a broad design goal that that now is being fulfilled in a in a different way. I want to kind of avoid getting into too details here. I can talk about if people want but that validator custody?

60
00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:27.809
Dustin: And and so it essentially got replaced a little bit by validator custody in its overall role.

61
00:14:28.123 --> 00:14:53.550
Dustin: And and importantly, not a single team. We haven't been testing it. We haven't been deploying it at the most. Anybody is is really kind of saying about this as well. Maybe in some future time. This might be a useful technique again. But but the idea is like, for now we're practically not using it. Don't have this part of the spec. If somebody wants to be introduced, make make it sort of aligned to spec with what people are doing and what we're actually planning on in the near term.

62
00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:00.879
Dustin: If people want to reintroduce this in a future version of pure dos or full dos, or something else, and we can do that. But.

63
00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:11.799
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you. I'm read through the context on this. Does anyone else have comments on?

64
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:18.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, it sounds plausible. This is the general agreement to to match this, or is there disagreement? Or.

65
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:29.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, I guess maybe the better question by numbers from chat is exactly like more, more concrete. Anyone opposed to merging this in.

66
00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then I think the decision is to merge that

67
00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:45.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: awesome. Then the second pr is

68
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:52.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: from Manu, I think. And I think I see I saw you on the call. Right. Could you briefly talk about that?

69
00:15:52.870 --> 00:15:56.056
Manu: Please tell me if my connection is bad, actually,

70
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.549
Ansgar Dietrichs: We'll do, for now it's good for now it's good we can.

71
00:15:59.550 --> 00:16:03.237
Manu: Okay, perfect society is right now.

72
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:15.989
Manu: it is not possible to request a data colon by a root for finalized block. It is only possible to request by Roots Colon for unfinalized block.

73
00:16:16.290 --> 00:16:21.120
Manu: I guess this comes from the copy paste from Blobs, which

74
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:24.349
Manu: itself was a copy paste from blocks, because some

75
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.799
Manu: some clients does not store finalized and unfinalized blocks

76
00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.560
Manu: in the same way in the debit.

77
00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:42.320
Manu: But for the tech columns, I guess it would be very useful to be able to. Yes, to request. Finalize the tech columns by root.

78
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:52.710
Manu: For the reason I describe a little bit more in the pr description, like, if you

79
00:16:53.530 --> 00:17:10.449
Manu: request a lot of data columns by range. But if for any reason there is few scars missing data columns in the response, then you have to generate a bunch of new by range data columns, requests which is not very convenient.

80
00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:19.820
Manu: And if we can request data columns by root, we can just generate only one request for all missing data columns.

81
00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.440
Manu: which is more convenient.

82
00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240
Manu: That's all.

83
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:45.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any comments on this Pr, I think I see lighthouse in favor of merging

84
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: any. Basically, again, any anyone who would be opposed to this Pr.

85
00:17:55.910 --> 00:18:03.782
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then again, we can go forward and merge it perfect. Then onto the 3rd one,

86
00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:13.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: 4, 4, 0, 6. I think that was from Justin. In in a conversation with with people from lighthouse. If I'm not mistaken.

87
00:18:13.702 --> 00:18:19.689
Ansgar Dietrichs: does. Is anyone from from lighthouse with comment on and with context, on the call that could talk about this one.

88
00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:25.759
ethDreamer (Mark): I don't know that it was from us for the clarifications.

89
00:18:26.543 --> 00:18:30.660
ethDreamer (Mark): It was kind of as a result of multiple

90
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:37.970
ethDreamer (Mark): like a discussion among multiple cl clients. But I don't see any issues with this.

91
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:42.589
ethDreamer (Mark): The clarifications are are definitely necessary.

92
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.169
ethDreamer (Mark): I don't think they really change

93
00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:53.152
ethDreamer (Mark): like change. What was what was discussed at

94
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:59.160
ethDreamer (Mark): the Berliner Berlin torat, but they they make it explicit, and they make it visible. So.

95
00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:01.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah.

96
00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:03.210
ethDreamer (Mark): 4, 4, 0, 6, right.

97
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:04.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes, that's right.

98
00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:05.180
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah.

99
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:20.227
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, sorry again, again, context on these. But but yeah, okay, I mean, that sounds like it's it's not really changed. Just justification.

100
00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:29.530
Ansgar Dietrichs: then, yeah, if sounds like, like, is there is there anyone that that has context on the on this? That? The people? Yeah, Francisco.

101
00:19:30.652 --> 00:19:35.969
Francesco: No. Sorry. This is actually about the the 1st pr. Again. So 1st complete this discussion.

102
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:48.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, we'll get back to the 1st one in a second. But then first, st just to stay with 4, 4, 0, 6 anyone who has contacts on this would be opposed to merging

103
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: 4, 4, 0 6.

104
00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:04.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then sounds like we would also be

105
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:14.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: good to go with merging the 3rd one, and then we have a 4th one. But before we get to that, then let's briefly revisit the 1st one. Francesco, you had some comments.

106
00:20:14.714 --> 00:20:23.505
Francesco: Yeah. Sorry I should have said you before, but I I thought Jimmy might be here, and but I think I see, is not an yet sent on this court like earlier this morning.

107
00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:31.122
Francesco: basically like he had expressed that he he doesn't necessarily think that we should get rid of the pure sampling. Spec.

108
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:37.000
Francesco: I think it would be okay to still go ahead and do it. But I think this is a fairly

109
00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:59.650
Francesco: like, I don't think removing this or not removing this is gonna affect anything like, as we kind of said, like, the point of removing is that no one's actually implementing this so I think you'll be okay to make this change whenever. So maybe we can just let this like sit open for a little bit more, and, you know, actually finish the conversation with the middle parties involved. Again. I don't think it's a big deal big deal either way, but.

110
00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:34.929
Dustin: I I personally, I mean, aside from everything else that I find a lot of value. And here I'm not trying to speak on behalf of magnesia or anything. A spec that clearly delineates what is and is not actually real. We have a couple of other corners in the specs here, where, especially in the more experimental ones where they're, they're not actually real. Nobody implemented them ever. And I think those are unfortunate, too. But as this moves into production. I think it's worth being very, very clear

111
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.109
Dustin: about what is real and what is not. And right now this is not real.

112
00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.670
Francesco: Yeah, I mean, I I agree. I think if it stays, it should be like

113
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:53.969
Francesco: somehow made clear that this is not a part of the spec that the the clients are implementing right now, or something like that. I think that

114
00:21:54.540 --> 00:22:10.089
Francesco: the argument for not removing is something along the lines of this is something that you could implement after fully was live without necessarily coordinating with other clients, and and so on and so forth. Whereas I guess if we didn't have it in the spec, that sort of maybe would require

115
00:22:10.811 --> 00:22:14.818
Francesco: yeah. Then re-adding into the spec later.

116
00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:20.904
Francesco: but yeah, I don't know again. I don't have a strong opinion on this. I I am just saying, like Jimmy specifically

117
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:25.180
Francesco: express an opinion against removing it. But

118
00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:37.510
Francesco: but I think you just like this conversation. I think maybe was in a thread. I don't know this kind of thing, that it was a bit lost somewhere, and at least I personally don't find much urgency in changing this, because it doesn't affect at all what what's happening with the

119
00:22:37.854 --> 00:22:46.989
Francesco: the things that people are actually implementing. So I would consider maybe holding off on this for a few more days. But I I don't know. I'm okay. Even if we decide to merge that. That's fine with me.

120
00:22:48.860 --> 00:23:06.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, given that there was quite a bit of support from merging it, I would be, is there basically anyone anyone else that would be would would be in favor of of waiting one more round of comments for a decision here. Sounds like we wouldn't necessarily need need this for for saka work to to move forward, so

121
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:10.910
Ansgar Dietrichs: default, I would still go ahead and merge it. But if if there's anyone else

122
00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:14.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: would prefer to to hold off on this one

123
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:38.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: sounds like, so if if no one is implementing it and in the chat, if if they also, it sounds like Jimmy would not be super opinionated about this. Just had some concerns. So then

124
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:44.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: I would say, unless someone disagrees. Now, I think we would stick with the decision and just merge it.

125
00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:57.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, that's stick with that. And if you feel strongly about this, then

126
00:23:57.660 --> 00:24:10.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: later point in this call like, speak up or otherwise. That's that's the decision merging the pr, okay, then we have one more Pr in this section, the last one. Let me

127
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:14.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: have a look that one was, I think, also from

128
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:26.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: just in in a conversation with Casey, I think, originally, but also maybe several people involved. I'm not sure if either Casey or someone else who has context on this Pr is on the call. I'll put the link in chat.

129
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:30.460
kasey: Is this about 4? 4? 0, 7.

130
00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:34.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: 4, 4, 7. 0, yeah, sorry I should have. I should have mentioned that. Yeah. 4, 4, 7.

131
00:24:34.610 --> 00:24:57.789
kasey: Yeah. So this is just kind of clarifying some of the language around the requirement to disconnect. If the Nfd doesn't match currently says that you must disconnect at the Fork boundary, and what will happen, and and the way things have been worded previously is, if you're not on any of the same topics, and you're not agreeing with fork digest for the purposes of Rpc. Encoding. You'll just

132
00:24:57.790 --> 00:25:06.769
kasey: downscore each other and not have any positive peer score activity, and you'll just disconnect and so like, we can kind of let that happen. And if

133
00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:15.259
kasey: people want to implement this, I think it's I think it's fine, totally, but optional, and it seems like Raoul agrees in the issue, and I think he introduced that word originally.

134
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:25.550
kasey: So the idea is to just clarify that you must not disconnect before. But you know you may. You may, after.

135
00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:30.230
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Mac.

136
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:38.359
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I mean, I I don't know if you said that the existing language was that you must disconnect before, because

137
00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.430
ethDreamer (Mark): if that was the existing language.

138
00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.310
ethDreamer (Mark): I would. Yeah, I would say that this

139
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:49.400
ethDreamer (Mark): oh, at the fort boundary, but not sooner. Oh, okay, none of mine. So

140
00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:54.360
ethDreamer (Mark): I do like the clarification. Yeah.

141
00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:03.389
ethDreamer (Mark): I just thought I thought it was more needed. I thought, the the original language is wrong. It looks like it's just

142
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:08.110
ethDreamer (Mark): clarifying and and adding things sorry.

143
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:10.230
ethDreamer (Mark): But yeah, I do support.

144
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:18.349
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. And would there be anyone opposed to imagining this? Then?

145
00:26:27.730 --> 00:26:36.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, I think, looks like we will go 4 to 4, 4 to 4 and 4 on merging. So we'll also merge. This 4th pr.

146
00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:45.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: perfect. So that's those are the prs, at least the the ones directly relevant to to Fusaka.

147
00:26:45.170 --> 00:27:02.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then next up. Next topic we wanted to talk about is the question of spec freeze for Fusaka. Basically like, are we ready for this? How much close to to it are we? I think, Barnabas, you wanted to say something to to get that conversation started.

148
00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.699
Barnabas: Oh, sorry

149
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:15.926
Barnabas: I thought I was unmuted.

150
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.029
Barnabas: Which conversation.

151
00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:23.709
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, just the question of whether we are ready to do for spec freeze, for for

152
00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: for the Fussaka spec.

153
00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.510
Barnabas: I think we should be.

154
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:39.750
Barnabas: I think we should be ready to freeze this back. Yeah, at at least on the side once. All these 4 Prs are merged in we should be able to have another offer release, possibly

155
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:48.849
Barnabas: office 3, and then going forward, we should be able to do better receipts. That will be. Doesn't specific races.

156
00:27:55.990 --> 00:28:07.819
Barnabas: does it? Any of these cl, devs feel like there's still some open questions regarding pure desktop especially, or Bpo. Spec.

157
00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:14.870
Barnabas: I think there was one more open Bpo question regarding the Max transaction.

158
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:19.479
Barnabas: But that's it's more of a question for next week. I think.

159
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:41.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then, just for my understanding, would that mean that because we will still have a devnet? 3? Obviously so, there would not be any expected changes anymore between Devnet 2 and definite. 3 from the Cl. Spec. Side.

160
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:52.999
Barnabas: Yeah, from the sales back side. Only these 4 Prs, but none of these would be new. As far as I understand, all these clarifications are already included in that. Not too.

161
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.150
Barnabas: And yeah.

162
00:29:01.050 --> 00:29:09.399
Barnabas: these Prs, once they are merged in, we should be basically spec complete for on the sales side.

163
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:22.809
Barnabas: and then physically, could possibly launch in approximately 2 weeks with the adjusted 7, 9 0. 7, and possibly any other vip that needs repricing

164
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:26.979
Barnabas: for Devnet 3, and then devnet 3 should be the frozen spec.

165
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:30.850
Barnabas: and that should be the spec that is touching Mainnet.

166
00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:32.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right and.

167
00:29:32.954 --> 00:29:37.630
Barnabas: Except for Bpo's, because at this point we still don't know the Bpo values.

168
00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:59.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. Yeah, just for clarification for people listening. So we will still like this would only be freezing on the Cl. Side and then on the El side. Basically, we will have another next week where we would then freeze the fully. Freeze the El Specs. There's still a few very last things in flight there for for 3

169
00:30:00.372 --> 00:30:05.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: and then basically that the hope would be that that would be the

170
00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:25.849
Ansgar Dietrichs: the specs that, as part of said that would not include the specifics of the Bpo fog values, even though they might at least some initial Bpo fogs will be rolled out together with the client releases for the main Fusaka fog. But that's still separate forks, basically. So those are specifically not what we're talking about here, freezing. But the Fusaka spec itself. Then

171
00:30:26.671 --> 00:30:30.119
Ansgar Dietrichs: would be frozen from on the Cl side.

172
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:35.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: of course, pending no issues during testing that that actually

173
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: requires to to make changes further changes.

174
00:30:40.071 --> 00:30:48.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is there anyone that feels like we are not ready for that? Is there anyone that still has concerns that? This this would be premature, or are we generally

175
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: feeling good about this?

176
00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:26.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, it sounds like, maybe no one has serious concerns. And so my understanding is that there's a chance. We would want to launch definite 3 before the next Acdc. Right? So if next Acdc is in exactly 2 weeks, it could be that we're launching Devnet 3 before then. So basically that there will be no further Acdc before that aspect is fully frozen. So so, indeed, that this is the last moment in time, basically awesome. But then with that, I guess.

177
00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: unless something unexpected happens, then Fusaka Cl side specs are frozen

178
00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: perfect.

179
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.875
Ansgar Dietrichs: That that was easier than thought,

180
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:53.919
Ansgar Dietrichs: okay, then we can move on to the next topic, the last one for Fusaka, which specifically is exactly about the part that's not frozen, which is the Bpo strategy. So basically like these kind of

181
00:31:54.080 --> 00:32:06.259
Ansgar Dietrichs: tiny parameter. Only folks that we will have after Fusaka. I think there was a Sigma prime blog post, I think. But, Jimmy, but I think Jimmy's not on the call. If maybe someone from Sigma Prime would want to

182
00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:07.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: M.

183
00:32:07.930 --> 00:32:13.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: Talk a little about kind of the the Sigma pine. Thoughts on this to get us started.

184
00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:21.509
ethDreamer (Mark): The the post was mostly about

185
00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:27.279
ethDreamer (Mark): about like wanting to freeze the specs. So I think we more or less

186
00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:33.170
ethDreamer (Mark): just decided that and the Sigma Prime team was in favor of freezing the specs.

187
00:32:35.897 --> 00:32:42.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, sorry about that. I thought I thought reading it. There was also something about basically like

188
00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:47.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: good basing to what's basically shipping I don't know. I thought there was also some.

189
00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:50.949
ethDreamer (Mark): It wasn't suggested, like target for the blobs.

190
00:32:53.400 --> 00:33:05.349
ethDreamer (Mark): that we would ship for up to to maybe 18 blobs at the at the fork boundary, and then maybe have a Bpo for it for 24.

191
00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:09.610
ethDreamer (Mark): But yeah.

192
00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then. Yeah, thanks. So sorry about that. Then then kind of

193
00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:33.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: misplaced that article a little bit. Okay? Then I think Barnabas and Pawri. I'm not sure which of the 2 of you I think you both had some specific thoughts on the kind of the the which Bpos to to potentially bundle with the initial mainnet releases of Fusaka. And

194
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.470
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, basically, the general strategy approach here.

195
00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:50.790
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, maybe I can start with some context, typically for the Neb as well as Electra. We had a bunch of analysis on mainnet that was done to try and arrive at a block. Count that we deem

196
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:52.689
Parithosh Jayanthi: the network can handle

197
00:33:53.139 --> 00:34:14.510
Parithosh Jayanthi: however, with pierdas that changes, we can do all the analysis we want right now. It just won't really mean much for a post peer das world. Which is why our proposal would be to have a very conservative bump immediately. After Fusaka, so that could be Bpo one.

198
00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:27.149
Parithosh Jayanthi: So that would essentially mean we have Fusa. We get roughly, let's say, a week, 2 weeks, whatever worth of pristine data where we can comparedas and post periods.

199
00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:52.010
Parithosh Jayanthi: And then we have Bpo, one that increases blob counts by a relatively small number to give us some scaling short term, and then we can actually do all the analyses that we want on with the main data, and then we can schedule the next 2 Bpo's, which can be a lot more aggressive if required, and in general, I think the plan should be that we can, we should ship

200
00:34:52.100 --> 00:35:09.490
Parithosh Jayanthi: at Max. 3 Bpos, because trying to do analyses beyond that, on how the network might predict might behave in the future is kind of hard. Yeah, we wanted to propose this as a general strategy for Bpos, and see if there was any initial reaction or opinions from clienteles.

201
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:19.620
Justin Florentine (Besu): When you say a small bump for Bpo. One. Is there a number that we have in mind already?

202
00:35:22.007 --> 00:35:24.860
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think we were imagining like 9 12.

203
00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:29.160
Parithosh Jayanthi: But again, it's an open question. I don't think we have a

204
00:35:29.857 --> 00:35:33.790
Parithosh Jayanthi: yeah. The Sigma Prime Post, for example, talks about 18 instead.

205
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:55.930
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think one of the other side effects of this staggered ish approach is that we can also let demand catch up. Faster.

206
00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:12.080
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I want.

207
00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:25.260
pawan: Yeah, when you mentioned that like, post Bpo, one like we can have more aggressive targets if everything looks good like, what numbers did you have any numbers in mind for that as well.

208
00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:52.149
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think that's the tricky bit, because until the data is there, I feel like it's hard to make a prediction. The good thing is Sunnyside labs networks, as well as all the hardening stuff we do over the next one might give us a nice upper limit. And then we can choose how close to the upper limit we're going on subsequent. Bpo's. But yeah, I don't wanna give a number right now and then have to backtrack it once the data is there?

209
00:36:53.696 --> 00:37:13.790
Parithosh Jayanthi: I guess the overall question is, then, are we okay with the blob numbers looking different on test nets versus mainnet. Do we wanna just have all the Bpo scheduled on testnets? What's our strategy? Because I would assume we don't want to go through the whole testnet. Bpo mainnet, Bpo. Cycle for the future.

210
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:25.350
Parithosh Jayanthi: I guess in general, are we okay with test nuts having a different? They they might end up at the same value, but they might have a different intermediate value.

211
00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:49.740
pawan: You're basically saying, test nets have a little more aggressive targets, that's all.

212
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:57.830
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, exactly. So test nets could jump already to 20 blobs, for example, and on Mainnet we might just do 18.

213
00:37:58.490 --> 00:37:59.229
pawan: Make, sense.

214
00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:21.889
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is that something that it would be good to have L 2, or like, basically, if input from people that would want to test blobs at that kind of higher throughput level but whether for them that would be a headache or something, if if those there would be different values between the test nets and Mainnet? Or is that something that if you come comfortable wouldn't be an issue.

215
00:38:31.330 --> 00:38:43.100
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I'm I'm not sure at the moment. It would be nice if we have people testing the higher throughputs on test nets as well, but I I guess, at least on testnet, we can just induce the load, if required.

216
00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:52.010
Francis: I don't think there's any problem with testnet and many that have different configurations.

217
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:59.379
Francis: It's just mainly like for the higher throughput. There might be situations where we cannot submit blobs fast enough, but

218
00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.200
Francis: like we can test that in testing as well.

219
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:23.149
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Some principle, it seems like it might would be an option at least, to have testnets at at different numbers.

220
00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:39.829
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do do we have people like, do we have opinions? So 1st of all, maybe pari, a question in terms of like, what? What do you see as the timeline for decision making on on the Bpo rollout strategy here, like, how how much more time would we have to make these decisions.

221
00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.989
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think, until we start talking about test networks, we can essentially change our mind. It's a

222
00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:53.560
Parithosh Jayanthi: config value that has to be changed and will likely be tied in with the releases that go out for test nets. So

223
00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.509
Parithosh Jayanthi: I guess the next month.

224
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:08.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then, I think maybe today is primarily about flagging this topic. Getting a 1st round of busy people's

225
00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:10.779
Ansgar Dietrichs: opinions and then, yeah.

226
00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:29.709
Ansgar Dietrichs: taking it from there for for next Acdc, is there anyone else that like has specific like opinions on on kind of like initial rollout, like what one Bpo, as I put a chat like I personally kind of like to be 2 2 bpo's that already come with with the Fussaka rollout. But, like. Is there anyone else that wants to briefly present their opinion here?

227
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:43.640
Francesco: A more opinion, a question like, how if we did do this? Separate Bpo like not already scheduled in in Fusaka? How long after Fusaka. Do we think that that would need to be.

228
00:40:45.798 --> 00:41:00.690
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think, at least on the data analysis side, we we try to have one week worth of useful data. And then it takes, let's say, 3 to 5 days to do a good high quality analysis on the data that we've collected.

229
00:41:01.193 --> 00:41:12.149
Parithosh Jayanthi: And there's, I guess, one more caveat. I forgot to mention earlier with Fusaka. There's also some repricing that are required for increasing the gas limit, so that might be another

230
00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:16.322
Parithosh Jayanthi: sort of parameter we're playing around with which leads to this

231
00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:25.069
Parithosh Jayanthi: which leads to me at least, feeling more like we should be conservative because we're playing around with a lot of parameters at the same time.

232
00:41:25.576 --> 00:41:37.040
Parithosh Jayanthi: But yeah, it it, I think in general, is about the release overhead and getting the community to upgrade. I would say, we're looking at like a 1. Ish 2 ish month time, 1, 1 and a half month. Timeline, I guess.

233
00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:50.169
Ansgar Dietrichs: And and just to clarify there, basically because we would say we would decouple the throughput numbers on testnets from Mainnet, we would not have to 1st go through a full kind of update up upgrade cycle for all the test nets. Is that right?

234
00:41:50.170 --> 00:42:07.050
Parithosh Jayanthi: I guess that's the question. Right now. We could, for example, bake in all 5 bpos and have the testnet sitting at 48 blobs, or whatever the upper limit we agree on is. And then we just have to do mainnet, because the test nets are already above the mainnet number.

235
00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:11.839
Parithosh Jayanthi: I guess that would save us a few weeks worth of doing test nets first, st and then Mainnet.

236
00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:23.889
Barnabas: I would actually recommend to bake in the and Bpo. One numbers in the minute releases. Once it comes to that.

237
00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:25.740
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, for sure. Yeah.

238
00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:33.769
Barnabas: So like we wouldn't need to make a different release for Bpo one, and then for Bpo, 2 we could actually

239
00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:40.459
Barnabas: reconsider and and see when it makes sense, and then give like 2 weeks

240
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:46.310
Barnabas: notice, to know the printers to like, roll up the new version.

241
00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:58.460
Parithosh Jayanthi: Exactly so. That is the proposal that when we have the Fusaka releases, it comes with Bpo, one values as well as a timeline baked in, but not for Bpo. 2, 3, and how many ever we decide after.

242
00:43:00.070 --> 00:43:02.470
lightclient: Is there a reason to not include

243
00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:11.890
lightclient: 2 and 3? As, like our optimistic values, we're planning to choose, like, I think the upgrade cycle is quite long for this type of stuff.

244
00:43:12.930 --> 00:43:27.779
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think that's the alternate approach. Then, we just pre select everything, and we decide to, let's say, abort or make another release to change the Bpo values. The question is, which approach do we want right now?

245
00:43:28.678 --> 00:43:30.629
Parithosh Jayanthi: I personally feel like

246
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:37.219
Parithosh Jayanthi: agreeing to a number and then trying to change. It is messier than just agreeing to the number later.

247
00:43:38.290 --> 00:43:42.010
Parithosh Jayanthi: But I can see both ways if we want to be really aggressive.

248
00:43:50.270 --> 00:44:02.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. And I think the good thing is, we don't have to decide that today. But I feel like, kind of it's already clear with the kinds of aspects that we have to weigh here against each other. Also the specific kind of turnaround time for a minute. I mean, put us on chat that

249
00:44:03.382 --> 00:44:21.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: it's maybe a bit too optimistic to think that between client releases and mainnet hard fork we could ever do. 2 weeks might need a bit more for Mainnet specifically. But still, if we can skip the test nets, that still means that the turnaround time, for between client release and and Mainnet Fork would be unusually short at least.

250
00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:43.959
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, any other comments on this topic for today. Otherwise, again, decisions we would make in 2 and or 4 weeks from now on, on the next one or 2 Acdcs.

251
00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:59.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anything otherwise Bpo related that we would want to already have in mind for

252
00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:06.319
Ansgar Dietrichs: for now in between for for devnets or anything basically anything about Bpo related that that is kind of short term, urgent.

253
00:45:19.438 --> 00:45:48.019
kasey: One thing I brought up before was the idea of having a rollback built into the schedule where we we increase, and then we decrease just to make sure that that's a scenario that the system handles gracefully. And I think people push back on the idea of doing that in Mainnet but I think we should consider doing that in at least like sepulia like a a test net where there are things that aren't only El and Cl. Running.

254
00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:50.589
Barnabas: I think we're gonna do that on hold team.

255
00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:10.809
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah. So we have host key as an option for that as well as sepulia. Sepulia is also kind of a weird network, because basically, every validator is a super node purely because it's a very small network. And most people run all of their keys on one host.

256
00:46:11.681 --> 00:46:15.469
Parithosh Jayanthi: So yeah, it's gonna have different patterns, anyway. So.

257
00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:34.754
kasey: Yeah, I don't know if there's any validity to this, but I was also thinking about things outside of El and Cl, that might bake in assumptions about the schedule and that if any of those pieces

258
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:44.269
kasey: is fragile in a rollback scenario, it would be better to find that out when the network isn't already in trouble, was was my thinking. But not not gonna push too hard for that.

259
00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:55.960
Dustin: I would continue to push back against this idea of of Bpo rollbacks as an emergency measure. It is never going to happen.

260
00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:20.270
Dustin: We know we don't have the logistics for this in terms of the deployment or or coordination. Now you can argue that there are certain failure modes where it's like. It's kind of whipping along. And it turns out that we just kind of disenfranchised a few more nodes, and that then eip 7,870 really anticipated, and you know that I can see that kind of scenario. But the idea is something going seriously wrong and like no.

261
00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.469
Dustin: no, please don't plan on that.

262
00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:25.099
Dustin: It's not gonna happen.

263
00:47:27.540 --> 00:47:33.120
Dankrad Feist: I was running back a Bpo different from just making another hard fork.

264
00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:39.639
Dankrad Feist: I think like it's it's an equivalent thing, right just to some new client releases.

265
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:53.419
Dustin: Right. My point is not, of course, either is possible is that neither is an emergency measure. Neither is oops. We push too far too fast.

266
00:47:53.850 --> 00:48:00.969
Dustin: you know. And now let's revert like this is my only point.

267
00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:05.249
Dankrad Feist: I guess if it's not an emergency measure, then like it's also.

268
00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:09.649
Dankrad Feist: then the Ppo is also just fine, like it works.

269
00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.430
Dustin: But they work as well as each other.

270
00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:35.139
Dustin: But but the the basic premise of as Prac. Here's what I'm getting at the basic premise of Let's as practice, for when we might want to do an emergency rollback, etc, etc, etc. Then, like No, I would stop there and say, that's we already screwed up really, really badly

271
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:44.290
Dustin: like that, that is, and and in a way that I is not going to be recoverable in that specific way is would be my would be my claim.

272
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:46.020
Dustin: So

273
00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:56.629
Dustin: it's it's not that Bpos as a mechanism are worse than sort of ordinary hard forks. It's that the question is irrelevant to me.

274
00:48:57.190 --> 00:49:01.690
Dustin: It speaks to an approach that is misguided.

275
00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.040
Marius van der Wijden: Why?

276
00:49:09.850 --> 00:49:10.980
Marius van der Wijden: Because.

277
00:49:12.310 --> 00:49:20.050
Marius van der Wijden: like, if if we if we schedule something that is that is and we'll figure out, it's it's broken.

278
00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:22.769
Marius van der Wijden: and we need to unschedule it right.

279
00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:31.450
ethDreamer (Mark): I think I think, Dustin, you're essentially saying that we'd be more or less testing in prod like.

280
00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:32.210
Dustin: Yes.

281
00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:40.779
ethDreamer (Mark): Like we're we're raising it to a limit, we think is fine. We're not quite sure we're gonna let it be there for a little bit and then quickly switch back. And that's what you're objecting to.

282
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.260
Dankrad Feist: That's not what's being suggested. What's being suggested is using the

283
00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:56.740
Dankrad Feist: previous race. The data from the previous race to like understand, if the next race is safe.

284
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:14.720
Dankrad Feist: I don't think the idea is to like 1st raise. Oh, it wasn't good. Now we're going back down that I don't think that is what's what we're suggesting.

285
00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:19.319
Dustin: No, but but but the argument for doing that was as practice, for

286
00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:42.150
Dustin: indeed doing it as a as an in case measure as I understood it. Maybe I misunderstood this, the proposal, but it was like before the claim or the statement. The suggestion was well, we might have to, and so we should find out first, st if some of these other sort of non elcl ecosystem entities react particularly badly to it. And let's do that before the the network is in crisis.

287
00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.910
Dustin: That's that's why I'm reacting to.

288
00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:57.600
Dustin: I'm not against testing it per se. I see Mary is just posted. What I am against is viewing it as a.

289
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:03.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: A particularly useful escape patch for the network planning as a whole or Vpo planning as a whole.

290
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:09.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: We have maybe to just jump in, because we have several people with raised hands, so maybe go by orders.

291
00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:19.680
Potuz: Yeah. So I think you guys are having 2 separate discussions in parallel. So on the one hand, I think there, there was a suggestion of like shipping.

292
00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:32.200
Potuz: 2 Bpos separated enough so that we can recognize that the 1st one wasn't working as well as we respected the second one might be dangerous, and then that gives us time to

293
00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.369
Potuz: call off the second one.

294
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:42.910
Potuz: and my understanding of I mean, and Casey was suggesting to have an emergency release that would just roll back the previous

295
00:51:43.296 --> 00:52:03.540
Potuz: the previous Vpo and I kind of empathize. I mean, I I agree with the 1st approach, like we have we? We can schedule several of them as long as they're separated. We have enough time to call off the second one without any special mechanics, and I empathize with Dustin's point of view on rolling back and the mechanism to roll back. Because

296
00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:26.750
Potuz: if a Bpo actually happens and it's an emergency situation, then any mechanism to roll back would be exactly the same as just like planning a new hard fork. It would require the same sort of release strategy, and it doesn't. I don't. I don't feel like it's we're gonna gain much by having an emergency mechanism to go back because it sounds to me like it's exactly the same as just a normal, hard fork.

297
00:52:30.550 --> 00:52:32.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right Enrico.

298
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:43.729
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, to me, it's just we have now this mechanism that allows us to change things easier. So on one way

299
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:56.200
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): it's it's wrong that we can say, Okay, based on this, we can then go go on main unsafely. And just because we have this escape patch that can

300
00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:03.590
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): use it. But anyway, if we, we have to schedule Bpos in A

301
00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:28.979
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): in steps right? So there is even a possibility where the previous Bpo is fine when the next one activates, we see some network degradation which is not catastrophic, but still degradation. And we can still plan for the next Bpo that goes that put the the blobs a little bit

302
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:37.429
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): down. So we go back to a better situation, and we buy time to analyze things and improve. So

303
00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.049
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I think, like there are. There is this possibility as well.

304
00:53:42.970 --> 00:53:49.849
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): It's not a full rollback. It's just scheduling something new and and lower down the numbers.

305
00:53:56.370 --> 00:54:13.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense any other comments on either this topic narrowly, or kind of Ppo strategy in general. Otherwise I would also bias towards trying to wrap that up, for now and then we should have that conversation actively Async, between now and Acdc. In 2 weeks, and then, maybe already in 2 weeks. We can

306
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:22.150
Ansgar Dietrichs: finalize our general strategy, maybe with value still pending for the testing or something. But basically general rollout strategy, I think 2 weeks from now would be a good time for

307
00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.919
Ansgar Dietrichs: for decisions on this, but

308
00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:30.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: for today, maybe if there's any further comments, then now would be the time. Otherwise that would move on

309
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:40.470
Ansgar Dietrichs: Shaba.

310
00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:43.150
Csaba Kiraly: Yeah. So

311
00:54:43.530 --> 00:54:48.590
Csaba Kiraly: from my point of view, the the kind of baking in too many values is is very much belief based.

312
00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:53.780
Csaba Kiraly: And and we will have much more data later on. So I

313
00:54:54.380 --> 00:55:01.780
Csaba Kiraly: I don't see a reason to to bacon too many of these, because we can go faster. We can do so, but it's good to agree on

314
00:55:02.410 --> 00:55:07.379
Csaba Kiraly: on the timeline that we want to have. But but I think the baking in is is.

315
00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:13.140
Csaba Kiraly: I just don't see the technical value in in baking in many values, scaling

316
00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:22.319
Csaba Kiraly: because the many bottlenecks that can hit at every point of view. We will see and and we will learn from the mainnet. But we will learn also from tests in the meantime.

317
00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:27.070
Csaba Kiraly: which we can scale up testing. So

318
00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:31.898
Csaba Kiraly: it's not just learning from the previous bump. It's also more testing

319
00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:34.839
Csaba Kiraly: on the higher levels and larger networks.

320
00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:43.239
Csaba Kiraly: Yeah, so I would. I would just bake in one to close it.

321
00:55:45.260 --> 00:55:46.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good.

322
00:55:46.370 --> 00:55:52.527
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I think. Then, yeah, on external code of sec, at least, we will talk about that.

323
00:55:53.290 --> 00:56:06.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: And I think the different proposals are basic categories, either one Bpo baked in 2 Bpos baked in or multiple. And I think we've heard the different arguments already. So now it's about discussing it and coming to an agreement in 2 weeks.

324
00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:15.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. And then I don't see any further resistance. Shaba. If you could unraise yours.

325
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:27.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: then, yeah, then, let's move on to the. I think that was the last point that I had for Fusaka. Is there any other remaining Fusaka points that we would want to discuss today.

326
00:56:44.820 --> 00:57:01.529
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we can move on to the Glam section. That one is a short section. We only have 2 items. The 1st one is just yet one more. Pr, that one is a very old one by Xiaoway that has been open for quite a while. The I think the

327
00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: there was some

328
00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:23.689
Ansgar Dietrichs: questions around what? What basically are the main blockers there? My understanding is that it would be a requirement if we ever wanted to in the future change slot times. I'm not sure if that's the only motivation for the Pr. I'm not sure if someone that has context on this. Sorry? The number is 3, 5, 1 0. You can already see in the number that it's a bit of an earlier one. If there's someone

329
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:27.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: here that has context on that, and could briefly say something about it.

330
00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:42.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: put us.

331
00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:55.729
Potuz: No one's raising hands. The original motivation comes from an eip a pr made on the spec. I think it was Yasik who's proposed it first.st That was about like rearranging this slot

332
00:57:55.730 --> 00:58:15.060
Potuz: like changing the attestation, deadline, increasing it a little bit, realizing that we're wasting time with an idle node during aggregation and aggregation could be made shorter. That raised the problem, that the spec is phrased in terms of intervals per slot.

333
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:28.029
Potuz: And if we have, like a non symmetric slot, like the different intervals, have different timings. Then it would be better just to like, specify each of the deadlines in milliseconds instead of us an interval of the slot.

334
00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:56.000
Potuz: and that's the original motivation for the eip, and it turns out that if we change the total time of the slot anyways, we would need this, and since this is a No. OP. For most clients, except perhaps, like dealing with configuration and dealing with the spec tests. It's a simple eip to merge as long as we don't change the this form of the slot, because essentially, clients don't need to do anything. That's why I believe.

335
00:58:56.180 --> 00:58:59.459
Potuz: but I am in support of merging these assets.

336
00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:18.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, thank you. Is there? Basically, yeah, are there other clients have an opinion? Or to to ask the question, the way I did earlier, like, basically like, Is there any anyone who would be opposed to merging it as is?

337
00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:35.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then Barnabas also asked the question, chat, maybe, is there anyone who would be opposed to, even if they maybe are okay with this being merged? Is, would there any be anyone who would

338
00:59:35.970 --> 00:59:42.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: want to wait with merging this until we have full life on Mainnet.

339
00:59:57.410 --> 01:00:04.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is this silence? Because everyone is okay with merging it? Or is the silence? Because no one else's context, because then otherwise, like, I would just say, we merge it.

340
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:21.980
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah. The only concern, as as said, is some noise around configuration, and I don't know if there is possibility that we start breaking up a little bit. Some interrupt between

341
01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:31.950
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): clients like Mix, Vc. And Vn. Due to this configuration, changes floating around this the only risk that I see

342
01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:37.010
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): to waiting.

343
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:40.220
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Our troll fool.

344
01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:44.669
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Is a reasonable argument.

345
01:00:44.960 --> 01:01:00.249
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Even if I think that we, we have to go, we should go forward with this because it's a very basic thing that we have to do for everything else like slot and epbs. So we need to do that. So the

346
01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.410
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the quick the better.

347
01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:05.530
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But I see some noise.

348
01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:13.900
Barnabas: Could you maybe target Amsterdam branches with this

349
01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:18.879
Barnabas: spec so like any kind of Amsterdam

350
01:01:19.650 --> 01:01:24.149
Barnabas: that we're gonna be launching, it would be built on top of this.

351
01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:26.390
Barnabas: Would that make sense?

352
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:36.169
Barnabas: Because very, very shortly, we're gonna need to start doing the Instagram specific donuts also.

353
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:44.280
Barnabas: even probably before we hit follow, so I would most likely not wait till we hit. Follow to merge this line.

354
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:55.519
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So this is not going back to

355
01:01:55.910 --> 01:02:02.410
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): to phase 0 is something that enables on on a specific fork.

356
01:02:02.530 --> 01:02:03.270
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Correct.

357
01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.400
Barnabas: I think the config would go back to phase 0. Yes.

358
01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:14.999
Barnabas: so like you would need to maintain a different branch that is able to read in a different config.

359
01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:21.410
Barnabas: That would be your Amsterdam branch, or possibly an epbs specific branch.

360
01:02:43.390 --> 01:02:52.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I'm a little out of the loop on this. This sounded reasonable. What Barnabas was saying just now is that a reasonable strategy, basically merging it for the glam saddam

361
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:55.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: branches.

362
01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:15.909
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, if we even have porters and bannabas agreeing, then I think we can't really waste that opportunity. Yeah. Then, I think.

363
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:22.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: basically, if unless anyone wants to disagree, then I think that that's what we would want to, we we want to do here.

364
01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: So merge it. But for for Amsterdam.

365
01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, perfect.

366
01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:41.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: And maybe last, just to double check is that, do you think that that's generally clear what that exactly implies for for people.

367
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.279
Barnabas: I think so.

368
01:03:45.300 --> 01:03:48.800
Barnabas: I guess it's very clear for me, and

369
01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:54.509
Barnabas: we're gonna be the ones doing the glimpse and testing as well. So it should be very.

370
01:03:55.010 --> 01:03:57.599
Barnabas: very obvious for everyone. In my opinion.

371
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:03.119
Barnabas: it's just the question of what we want in Amsterdam. That's going to be the next question. I think.

372
01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:09.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Then let's.

373
01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:10.600
danceratopz: Which is.

374
01:04:11.030 --> 01:04:13.462
Ansgar Dietrichs: Basically for for the Glampson branches and

375
01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:23.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: move forward. We only have one remaining agenda item, which is also for Glamsterdam, and it is a headliner proposal.

376
01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:41.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think it's the last headline of proposal, because my understanding is that the deadline for proposing basically was, is over now, and this was the last one that basically made it in. So starting next Acdc, assuming that we basically do no longer too busy with Fusaka, we can then also open the discussion.

377
01:04:41.648 --> 01:04:52.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: For for picking headliners for today. It was between primarily just the presentation. But yeah, Barnaby, I think you're on the call to talk about shorter slot times.

378
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.690
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yes.

379
01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:55.219
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Can you hear me? Well.

380
01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:56.809
Ansgar Dietrichs: I can hear you. Well.

381
01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.130
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Okay.

382
01:05:00.122 --> 01:05:07.530
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yeah, we've been playing with our proposal. We sent it in pretty late. So thank you all for letting me present.

383
01:05:07.530 --> 01:05:09.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: And we can see your screen.

384
01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:11.490
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Okay, Zuko.

385
01:05:11.610 --> 01:05:20.900
BarnabÃ© Monnot: okay, this is a short presentation to drive home the point that shorter things are better. We're essentially trying to make the case for

386
01:05:21.030 --> 01:05:37.379
BarnabÃ© Monnot: moving to shorter slots for Glamsterdam in particular, moving from 12 second slots to 6 second slots, following an eap that was originally written by Ben Adams and Dunkrat, feist, and Julian and I joined more recently.

387
01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:48.429
BarnabÃ© Monnot: So why do we think 2 X shorter slots are very meaningful. The main message is that this makes ethereum l. 1

388
01:05:48.500 --> 01:06:10.979
BarnabÃ© Monnot: a better confirmation engine, which is essentially the main business of ethereum and its main value proposition to give some examples, it reduces transaction inclusion from 6 seconds on average to 3 seconds. It gives you 2 X censorship resistance from having 2 X block producers per unit of time.

389
01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:25.140
BarnabÃ© Monnot: It gives you lower dex fees for users from having less value picked up by arbitrages, and so more liquidity providers and so tighter spreads it accelerates finality. Time. If we don't change anything

390
01:06:25.270 --> 01:06:32.079
BarnabÃ© Monnot: from the consensus, from what it is today, like 13 to 19Â min to something that's under 10Â min.

391
01:06:32.430 --> 01:06:43.719
BarnabÃ© Monnot: There's many downstream interrupt ux and cost benefits. And there's even more good things that are detailed in the in the proposal.

392
01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:49.109
BarnabÃ© Monnot: So why make this proposal for Glamsterdam?

393
01:06:49.380 --> 01:07:04.390
BarnabÃ© Monnot: I genuinely think that shorter slot would be a great option to to consider slotting it in at the time that Amsterdam is expected to to be released, meaning, after we have ramped up to 48 blobs and to

394
01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:08.520
BarnabÃ© Monnot: hopefully a hundred 1 million gas limit.

395
01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:24.180
BarnabÃ© Monnot: I also think it's a good idea to make this proposal to accelerate conversations about it. I don't think shorter slot time is contentious. I think we all agree that generally we want to move in that direction, so I also don't think it's like distracting too much.

396
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:39.770
BarnabÃ© Monnot: And I also think it's meaningful to have shorter slot in mind when thinking about the values restructuring proposal. So what I'm suggesting is to pipeline our thinking between the 2,

397
01:07:40.210 --> 01:07:41.559
BarnabÃ© Monnot: the 2 proposals.

398
01:07:44.610 --> 01:08:12.270
BarnabÃ© Monnot: How could we achieve it? So I've been. These are like very high, level straw men on the path to to implementation. Let's say, if we did decide to go with the route to include it in Amsterdam, I think we 1st need like a very serious study of attestation and aggregation propagation time in the Eip. The suggestion is 3 seconds for block propagation, 1.5 for attestation, 1.5 from aggregation.

399
01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:25.180
BarnabÃ© Monnot: There's a lot of anecdotal evidence out there that kind of make us reasonably confident that yeah, this is possibly workable. But I think we need to be. Yeah, just much more precise than this.

400
01:08:25.988 --> 01:08:52.409
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Then the second part is, there is a fairly large effort of just retrofitting the client and making the slot time conditional mainly because the chain has been running at some different slot slot time until now. So yeah, I understand that it's not like launching a new chain that just has 2 X slot times, like there's there's overhead that comes from this. And then, of course, testing to to make sure that everything works out

401
01:08:54.710 --> 01:09:13.620
BarnabÃ© Monnot: if we did not decide to do slot times in Glamsterdam, but instead to do that in Htar, and assuming that slot restructuring is what goes in Glamsterdam. So I think the path, then, is a little different. We obviously have a work of doing the slot restructuring, which involves

402
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:36.780
BarnabÃ© Monnot: figuring out the right one, testing, etc. We may not need to be so precise about the attestation and aggregation propagation, time study just because some of the proposals. They pipeline this like they remove some of this stuff out of the hot path. And so, yeah, we may have an easier time figuring out like the right partitioning of the slot.

403
01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:39.609
BarnabÃ© Monnot: There is still, I believe, the work of

404
01:09:39.850 --> 01:09:50.550
BarnabÃ© Monnot: retrofitting the client with this, with this conditional logic, and then still, the testing that needs to happen for the for the slot time. Hard work.

405
01:09:53.580 --> 01:10:21.979
BarnabÃ© Monnot: One thing I want to point out is that over the last week, like we've been looking at the restructuring slots with the length of the shorter slot times, and it brought up some challenges and opportunities which some of them may be relevant. So maybe not. But I just want to point the high level points, because I think they're nice to have in mind. The 1st one is that whenever there are fixed overheads like one of them is, for instance, the attestation and aggregation round

406
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:38.139
BarnabÃ© Monnot: that happens at the end of the slot. These fixed overheads. They get worse, obviously with shorter slots, because if their time is incompressible, then when you have shorter slots, you spend a higher relative share of the slot incurring these these costs

407
01:10:38.370 --> 01:10:46.309
BarnabÃ© Monnot: there may be more ways that are interesting to to get out of some of these fixed overheads like something we discussed a bit was the idea of

408
01:10:46.430 --> 01:11:01.120
BarnabÃ© Monnot: essentially unbundling or pipelining the head vote from the source and target votes, so that the aggregation can be moved out of the hot path. This is also something that we get in epbs with the Ptc. And the attestations being earlier.

409
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:16.320
BarnabÃ© Monnot: And then another thing that I think came up quite a bit when we were discussing. This is this kind of trade-off that exists between the propagation time and the execution time and where we want to be on that frontier.

410
01:11:18.630 --> 01:11:22.539
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yeah, that's it for me. Thank you for your consideration.

411
01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.740
BarnabÃ© Monnot: I'm seeing a very active chat. So sorry I did not see the messages. I think so.

412
01:11:33.740 --> 01:11:44.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: Very primary clarification that people wanted was just that, basically by default. You would also argue for having the throughput per slot right to keep the throughput per time. Constant.

413
01:11:44.650 --> 01:11:57.160
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Correct. Yes, yes, so there are many that would need to be preserved. One of them is the throughput. Another one is the reward rate for stakers like, it doesn't mean you get 2 x, the issuance like you should still

414
01:11:57.290 --> 01:12:06.970
BarnabÃ© Monnot: keep that constant. So yeah, yeah, keeping everything equal unless there's a strong reason that by the time we move to this shorter slot

415
01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:19.729
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Fork, maybe we have scaling opportunities from for for different reasons, but all else equal. We would only want to change the slot time, and not like use that as a Trojan horse for making other changes. Yeah.

416
01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mark, do you have a comment or question.

417
01:12:28.050 --> 01:12:31.119
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I'm I would just like to make some

418
01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:39.745
ethDreamer (Mark): a general statement that I think is useful for everyone that's going to be participating in this debate. I've been participating in it since.

419
01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:45.260
ethDreamer (Mark): since Bill and the bill interrupt, and it's been ongoing, and I just wanted

420
01:12:45.790 --> 01:13:06.929
ethDreamer (Mark): say where I think the debate is from my perspective, and give people a chance to disagree on some just, very general statements, which is that, as far as I can tell, just based on where I I think there appears to be consensus that we want 2 things, and one of those is shorter slots.

421
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.829
ethDreamer (Mark): and the other one is some sort of slot, restructuring and pipelining.

422
01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:25.579
ethDreamer (Mark): people are in various camps on that, but I think everybody wants both of those, and there is also consensus that we can't do both of those things in Glamsterdam itself. And so the debate

423
01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:33.540
ethDreamer (Mark): is more or less about which form of pipelining, and which order to do these things in.

424
01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.250
ethDreamer (Mark): so does anyone disagree with those general statements.

425
01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:50.779
BarnabÃ© Monnot: I agree with them? Yeah, yeah, I think I've heard, indeed, that doing both in the same work is not feasible

426
01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:58.089
BarnabÃ© Monnot: unless I see, like strong evidence to the contrary. I think I would make that assumption, and then I do think it's a matter of

427
01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:01.550
BarnabÃ© Monnot: 1st selection of a restructuring proposal.

428
01:14:02.030 --> 01:14:18.819
BarnabÃ© Monnot: That's where I think, actually having the shorter slot. Timelines can be helpful, even if I also feel that the discussion has progressed quite a bit. And and we have like much higher confidence. So yeah, selection of a restructuring proposal and then ordering between

429
01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:23.870
BarnabÃ© Monnot: shorter slot time 1st or restructuring. First, st I think that's indeed the question. Yeah.

430
01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:30.480
ethDreamer (Mark): I? Okay, I'm glad there's agreement, because I I see the things the same way. And

431
01:14:31.590 --> 01:14:36.629
ethDreamer (Mark): from where I stand I want to get both of these things into ethereum as fast as possible.

432
01:14:39.230 --> 01:14:43.379
ethDreamer (Mark): So I I think there's also one more

433
01:14:43.660 --> 01:14:47.160
ethDreamer (Mark): point of agreement on a limited statement that

434
01:14:49.170 --> 01:15:07.519
ethDreamer (Mark): you know, people may disagree about whether or not this restructuring, the the favored pre restructuring proposal is 7, 7, 3, 2. But I think at this point there is agreement that 7, 7, 3, 2, regardless of what other trade offs you might believe, offers maximal pipelining, meaning that for the same

435
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:14.979
ethDreamer (Mark): slot time you have more blobs and more blocks than competing proposals. And

436
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:20.240
ethDreamer (Mark): I think there's also agreement that you

437
01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:28.110
ethDreamer (Mark): can have shorter slots from 7, 7, 3, 2 than you could for competing pipeline proposals.

438
01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:33.490
ethDreamer (Mark): So I I those are all the statements. I believe that there is agreement upon.

439
01:15:35.085 --> 01:15:37.060
ethDreamer (Mark): There may be others, but

440
01:15:37.650 --> 01:15:41.199
ethDreamer (Mark): I'd like to give anyone a chance to to disagree with that if

441
01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:46.539
ethDreamer (Mark): if that's not true, or if if yeah, you don't feel that.

442
01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. Enrico.

443
01:15:50.880 --> 01:16:02.110
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I just want to make the argument. Why, I think the restructuring in the form of 7, 7, 3, 2 should go 1st

444
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:06.660
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): is because the 7, 7, 3, 2 form

445
01:16:07.090 --> 01:16:15.975
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): is allowing us to decouple the consensus block from the payload and

446
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:26.690
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): no matter, you see, so reducing the slot time, anyway, in some form reduce the network resiliency.

447
01:16:26.890 --> 01:16:32.110
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So in my mental model going in that in buff first, st

448
01:16:32.887 --> 01:16:39.580
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): is wrong, because if you do the decoupling. First, st at least, you

449
01:16:39.790 --> 01:16:53.019
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the argument is having is will be. We will have a much more resilience on the consensus layer, because the block will be much smaller, and the

450
01:16:54.378 --> 01:16:58.010
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the instability might go only on the

451
01:16:58.150 --> 01:17:07.240
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): execution side of it, and we will have a much better consensus. Blocks flow, my dear.

452
01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:21.279
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. Then, just a comment for me as a researcher, not not as host. Basically. Yeah, I, I, personally am not super opinionated in terms of the ordering of of these 2, I do think maybe just as a general comment, I think.

453
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:38.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: while yes, 772 epbs, like we've been talking about for a long time. I think we shouldn't just be too quick in being like. Okay, then, obviously, it should go first.st I think that's probably where we'll end up with, anyway. But I think at least, at least, it's good to like to take the moment of being like, okay, which of the 2 should go first.st

454
01:17:38.150 --> 01:17:39.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: And

455
01:17:39.650 --> 01:17:52.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: the the one thing that I would say is, even if we end up doing slot, restructuring slash epbs, or something like that. First, st it's still a good exercise to already do that while discussing what that would look like in terms of implications for shorter slot times.

456
01:17:52.600 --> 01:18:09.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: And so in particular, Mark's comment, I think that basically, even for shorter slot epbs is optimal or close to optimal for actually making use of the window, and so actually is, in a way especially well positioned to then be shrunk later on. I think that's exactly the kinds of arguments we should look into

457
01:18:10.110 --> 01:18:13.530
Ansgar Dietrichs: M, yeah. And

458
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:21.319
Ansgar Dietrichs: and and the one question I would maybe have for people is just to double check. We always say there's no world where we would ever combine these 2?

459
01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:32.259
Ansgar Dietrichs: Are we certain? I mean sounds reasonable, and we should not do monster fox anymore. But is this something? We are 100% locked in on? Or is there like still a world in which these 2 could be in the same fork?

460
01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:40.110
ethDreamer (Mark): I would love to combine them, but I've heard that Harry's head would explode so.

461
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:45.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, we definitely don't want that.

462
01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:49.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, then let's continue with the comments, Ben.

463
01:18:50.952 --> 01:18:56.050
Ben Adams: I would I would argue, if we can shorten the slot times.

464
01:18:56.583 --> 01:19:00.410
Ben Adams: If that's a possibility, then that should go first, st because that has an immediate

465
01:19:00.810 --> 01:19:03.409
Ben Adams: user experience impact. If we

466
01:19:04.675 --> 01:19:13.609
Ben Adams: if we do delayed execution, that doesn't really change anything or epbs that doesn't actually change anything in the user experience.

467
01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.750
Ben Adams: So I would argue for a shorter slot

468
01:19:18.190 --> 01:19:27.509
Ben Adams: and then bring in epbs or delayed execution, or whatever to afterwards. To then allow us to start increasing gas again.

469
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:34.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mark.

470
01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:45.480
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I mean, I think the counterpoint to that. Is that like number one, we can't

471
01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:51.930
ethDreamer (Mark): have as short slots as we can after epbs is before

472
01:19:52.546 --> 01:20:00.370
ethDreamer (Mark): so like we may be able to get 6 seconds or sometime today, but we would certainly be able to do shorter after Eps

473
01:20:01.190 --> 01:20:08.490
ethDreamer (Mark): so we could be like putting ourselves into a position where the slots are longer than they need to be if we do it. The other direction and

474
01:20:09.980 --> 01:20:11.580
ethDreamer (Mark): I think.

475
01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:20.819
Ben Adams: But you, but you've had. You've had that additional lag that you have to wait an additional hard fork before any any.

476
01:20:21.250 --> 01:20:21.810
ethDreamer (Mark): You too.

477
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:22.770
Ben Adams: Very interesting.

478
01:20:22.770 --> 01:20:28.609
ethDreamer (Mark): Data doing it, doing 2 2 forks where you change the slot. Time is

479
01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:43.680
ethDreamer (Mark): like a lot of extra work. Now, we may not necessarily do 2 forks where we change the slot time, we may just say 6 seconds is fine, but even on top of that there's a lot of work around timing of various things that happen in the slot

480
01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.950
ethDreamer (Mark): that, like handoffs is gonna need to do. And

481
01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:57.110
ethDreamer (Mark): you know, if we did it the other way around. They're gonna need to do it twice. So even if we don't change the slot time twice, they would have to do those timings twice.

482
01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:08.559
ethDreamer (Mark): So that's the main like, I think, basically, the main argument is to sum up something like

483
01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:15.990
ethDreamer (Mark): we get to a world with both of these things slower, doing it the other way around, and

484
01:21:16.580 --> 01:21:22.410
ethDreamer (Mark): maybe, and and getting to an optimal world where of even lower latencies is even slower.

485
01:21:28.730 --> 01:21:48.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. Then, yeah, maybe one more quick one for me. I just wanted to agree to some extent with what Ben just said specifically from the scaling point of view. I understand Epbs has several benefits. Scaling is a big one, but not the only one, but in terms of scaling. Given that we just never really made scaling changes in ethereum in the past, or just for a long time. There is a bit of an overhang right now. So I think.

486
01:21:48.130 --> 01:22:13.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: even without epbs in Glamsadam we would still, out of Glam Saddam, have quite a bit of extra headroom for scaling with access list. If we choose to do that, or and or with just general repricing that, give us more, remove some of the worst cases. So in terms of scaling. Given that we like, if we scale immediately by a factor of 5, there's no usage, anyway, to take immediate advantage of that. So I think, in terms of immediate impact, actually like

487
01:22:13.550 --> 01:22:41.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: delaying and delaying the scaling aspect here until H. Star would probably not really be noticeable for users, because we already still have, like a smooth kind of scaling gradient, where shortest sometimes basically is the thing that otherwise you just don't have. So I do agree with Ben that just from a scaling point of view, basically like versus the benefits that shorter sometimes give, it might actually be that there's a more immediate benefit for users doing it this way around. But again, that's just a very partial argument.

488
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:56.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, that was last time for me making comments. Any other comments that obviously there's also quite a bit in chat if anyone would want to highlight anything out of chat for on the call.

489
01:22:57.787 --> 01:23:04.620
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: So 1 1 thing I'm just wondering. Maybe there was already some study there done

490
01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:27.859
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: what impact would be on the on the end users, because likely a lot of of these systems has a hard coded like a 2012 second slots there, and it could be a quite a big hassle for for these systems to to move to the new

491
01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:29.550
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: slot time.

492
01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:45.410
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yeah, maybe quickly on this. That's 2 things I've identified that might be important to look into is 1st systems like explorers. Them I feel like.

493
01:23:45.610 --> 01:24:00.990
BarnabÃ© Monnot: because there are chains that look like ours like gnosis chain that run at different slot times. There might already be like some infrastructure that is built that is flexible enough to change their assumptions.

494
01:24:01.130 --> 01:24:18.700
BarnabÃ© Monnot: There's probably still some that is not ready, and I think we should identify those. And the second thing is something that was also called out by Terence, and that's included in the headliner proposal. The possibility that some smart contracts may have hard coded 12 seconds

495
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:23.780
BarnabÃ© Monnot: in in their behavior. That seems

496
01:24:24.050 --> 01:24:28.769
BarnabÃ© Monnot: also it's likely that there are some the changes to work

497
01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:35.759
BarnabÃ© Monnot: with proof of work which was viable slot time. So yeah, you would maybe limit the amount of

498
01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:46.159
BarnabÃ© Monnot: the ones. But now I'm seeing that photo says, actually, arbitrum contract itself has this hard-coded assumption. So yeah, okay, maybe there is something to be done. There.

499
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:50.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: Welcome!

500
01:24:51.150 --> 01:24:57.039
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah. So, wading more into, like my personal views on on the debate, I do think that

501
01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:09.490
ethDreamer (Mark): in terms of the ordering of things like that. 7, 7, 3, 2 is just much more mature than shorter slot times for these kinds of considerations. And but I mean

502
01:25:09.690 --> 01:25:12.530
ethDreamer (Mark): me personally, I would also, like

503
01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:18.040
ethDreamer (Mark): my ideal world, is that we do? 7, 7, 3, 2, and we for sure do

504
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:23.786
ethDreamer (Mark): shorter slot times. The very next fork which would give of the

505
01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:27.359
ethDreamer (Mark): stakeholders like the time to prepare for that.

506
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:36.750
ethDreamer (Mark): and and could potentially be like developed in parallel the way that Electra and Fushaka were.

507
01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:40.330
ethDreamer (Mark): if we know what the headliner is, we can do it in parallel.

508
01:25:43.910 --> 01:26:04.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, just because I've heard this concern about, I mean, obviously, like 7, 7, 3, 2 already has the benefit of actually like not just being specs, but but but having having been implemented and and so on in terms of just the general implementation, complexity, testing, complexity of shorter slot times, this has been brought up in the past as a concern for even general Glam. Stamp viability?

509
01:26:04.570 --> 01:26:14.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Are there people that that have opinions and views on, independent of the ordering, and whether we want to do it in Glamsterdam. But like how realistic it would be for shorter slot times to be in Glamsterdam.

510
01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:25.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: as he put us in chat, saying a lot of work, but doable.

511
01:26:33.770 --> 01:26:34.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, put us.

512
01:26:36.190 --> 01:27:01.160
Potuz: So I don't know. I gave enough time to Preston to express his opinion on this. He's the one that's been working on this. It's been working for a few weeks and has a branch that is already passing tests and compiling at least a lot of things that need still to be changed from the point of view of the code base is not something. I mean, people think we just have this constant that you need to change, and that's it.

513
01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:23.090
Potuz: But the second order effects are huge. We have a lot of timing places where you need to deal with like, are we going to reorg this block or not. Is this block actually late? Are we counting attestations for the next slot early or not, because we made a bet that we will reorg this block. And then we decided that this block is not weak. We need to reorg it back.

514
01:27:23.090 --> 01:27:47.650
Potuz: We have cache that those cache has timing expirations. So when are we pruning those cash? We have optimistic syncing that is affected by this. That is one of the largest, most complicated pieces of code. On the Cl side, we have 4 choice that actually should take tracks of timing to decide whether or not the head is is weak or not. So this, besides the blockchain part of it.

515
01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:57.739
Potuz: There's so many places that the slop time changes affect that. It's going to be quite, quite hard to

516
01:27:57.820 --> 01:28:23.829
Potuz: test. However, having said so, I believe if the choices is, I mean I'm I'm of course I'm against having this in Glamsterdam, but I believe that it can be done in a single fork if it's chosen to be one one pr. It's just that. I think that the the number of things that need to be tested, the number of teams that need to be called that. It's it's just daunting to even start thinking about it.

517
01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:27.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: Annabe.

518
01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:32.340
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yes, yeah, yeah. I agree with Potus. My

519
01:28:32.710 --> 01:28:40.050
BarnabÃ© Monnot: question is, how much of that is just fixed work that we have to do, no matter what like, even if we were to restructure first.st

520
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:47.579
Potuz: All of it. So we are already working on it because we believe that we are going to ship this. And that's why, we started working on this

521
01:28:47.830 --> 01:28:48.270
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Okay.

522
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:51.139
Potuz: We will have to do this, anyways.

523
01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:55.940
BarnabÃ© Monnot: Yes, right? Right? Yeah. Yeah. So then, it's really a matter of

524
01:28:56.100 --> 01:29:09.069
BarnabÃ© Monnot: something is more ready now. So we might as well ship that 1st and have this big bundle of work like pipelined with the thing that is more ready. I I think that's reasonable.

525
01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:13.360
BarnabÃ© Monnot: I still to me like, yeah, from my viewpoint.

526
01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:22.270
BarnabÃ© Monnot: the sequence of operation that makes sense from a feature. Perspective is really shorter, slot time 1st and then restructuring. So there's a difference in opinion. Kill, of course.

527
01:29:22.854 --> 01:29:25.100
BarnabÃ© Monnot: But yeah, yeah, I do think

528
01:29:25.670 --> 01:29:34.520
BarnabÃ© Monnot: highlighting the extra overhead of doing, shortening 1st and then restructuring would be helpful to the, to the discussion as well.

529
01:29:34.940 --> 01:29:37.450
BarnabÃ© Monnot: What Barnabas asked in the chat essentially.

530
01:29:42.020 --> 01:29:42.815
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right?

531
01:29:45.020 --> 01:29:58.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, is there anyone with a specific opinion on on that specific question that Bannabas just put in chat, what's the implementation time basically of the 2 different orderings here, if we do. Ep, based 1st and then lower slot times or the other way around, basically, is there anyone that thinks that

532
01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:03.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: just in terms of implementation time, the ordering here matters for those.

533
01:30:03.610 --> 01:30:13.449
Potuz: Yeah, that was the argument that Mark was making. That we seem to disagree. But I don't understand why, because to me this is a no brainer testing the

534
01:30:13.590 --> 01:30:28.060
Potuz: timings on this. Within the slot is going to have to be done and benchmarking. This is going to have to be done twice instead of once. So certainly there's an obvious testing overhead by shipping slot times earlier.

535
01:30:28.530 --> 01:30:35.349
Potuz: So shipping epbs earlier has less impact on the testing team.

536
01:30:37.650 --> 01:30:39.359
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah. So to clarify

537
01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:52.319
ethDreamer (Mark): it, we we are of the opinion that in getting both of these things into ethereum it's long to do, it will take more time doing it the other way around. When you wanna

538
01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:55.050
ethDreamer (Mark): look at I don't. I don't know that.

539
01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:56.020
danceratopz: Do anything.

540
01:30:58.650 --> 01:31:01.470
ethDreamer (Mark): Okay, unfortunately, it has any impact.

541
01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:02.600
danceratopz: But.

542
01:31:04.340 --> 01:31:07.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: Can we have someone mute then?

543
01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:13.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: That? Oh, that that this account that's unmuted

544
01:31:17.190 --> 01:31:35.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: perfect. And okay. Then sorry I didn't want to drop you then, in terms of so because again, like, the idea is not to for today to make decisions. We also kind of only wanted to mostly highlight. This proposal have some light initial discussion just to highlight the questions or areas of disagreement. I think that probably we did quite well now

545
01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:54.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: and then the idea would be again in 2 weeks if if we are still very busy with kind of with Fusaka, that depends a little bit. But in principle. If we have the room, then we will really kind of go into into the discussion of what what we should prioritize for Glam Saddam in 2 weeks, and so ideally kind of people that have

546
01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:08.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: had disagreements on on this topic that were highlighted just now should take the next 2 weeks to basically iterate on that. And so that we we have the most information possible for for starting that discussion in earnest in 2 weeks.

547
01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:19.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect. Then, I think, unless there's any remaining comments, anything that was is urgent that we need to discuss right now. We have only a few minutes left, anyway, but I think we otherwise finished with the agenda

548
01:32:21.090 --> 01:32:22.820
