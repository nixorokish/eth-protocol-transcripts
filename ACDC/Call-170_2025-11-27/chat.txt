00:22:26	Caspar Schwarz-Schilling:	It’s literally CFI’ed for Glamsterdam and we’re about to push it into H*. This is precisely what we’re trying to prevent to happen again. (CFI is not a credible commitment)

Then the discussion goes back to whether it goes into Glamsterdam or not
00:25:56	Barnabas:	I think we need to start rethinking our process, as the current process is way to restrictive, which actually slows down potential decision making. Ideally pushing 2 forks a year, we need a process that allows for more pipelining.
00:25:59	Pari:	We also bypassed process in the past tbh. e.g: 4844, withdrawals and PeerDAS were all pushed as confirmed (or some variation of SFI) before the previous fork was even shipped.
00:26:07	0x:	Replying to "I'm still for FOCI..."

It looks like most of the CL teams are willing to delay the fork if necessary. At least that’s what they wrote in their Hackmd or in their stated preferences

I remember we had the mechanism where the deposit queue was increased based on how many validators we have. 

Ideally we could just have dynamic churn sizes based on validator sizes. So if we have 1M validators we have bigger churn, and if we have less validators, it goes back down.

yea, it’s not touching functionality, just convenience. for professional operators, i think predictable rewards can be accomplished by predictably manually withdrawing. for solo stakers, we don’t really need them to consolidate to have a meaningful impact on validator set size, it’s OK if they stay

00:59:52	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "It’s contentious for..." 

 Faster inclusion might be a great feature but this should be made clearer. People perceive CR as binary and see focil as solving the problem, which it does not. On-chain enshrined privacy does.

it will change the way we merkleize

well, or one SSZ library which can support both
01:24:15	Yann Vonlanthen:	Replying to "For the finality par..."

That’s a good point. We are working on a draft.

Exact trade-offs will also depend on how much we can squeeze out of networking. With new p2p improvements on the horizon, potentially things could be better than expected. In any case more consolidation will  always be better for fast finality, even more so in a PQ world.
01:24:41	Barnabas:	Not really a consensus related question, but we should consider working on making the engine ssz compatible. Maybe this is for a future call, but would like to open this box today, if we get some time in the end.

Well, to the extent one might remove the arbitrary lmits in `List`

probably, but the CL has to support it too

DFI you mean?
01:26:48	lightclient:	Replying to "I thought we were go..."

DFI for glamsterdam, CFI for heka
01:27:49	Dustin:	I mean we can and do
01:28:06	Phil Ngo:	Stating here that we are ok with SFI

yeah

CFI or SFI?
01:28:48	terence:	besides clients teams, what about the community?
01:28:48	lightclient:	Replying to "Nimbus is fine CFI'i..."

We’re asking about SFI
01:28:49	Ansgar Dietrichs:	At best it should be a proposal to be confirmed next week on acde
01:28:49	Barnabas:	SFI != CFI lmao
01:28:53	Dustin:	Replying to "Nimbus is fine CFI..."

SFI is fine
01:29:02	Potuz:	Replying to "I do think it’s a bi..."

I think the biggest issue is that there're teams working on contending
01:29:03	felix (eest):	Replying to "prysm == potuz"

shout out to ethpandaops for maintaining the hive mind
01:29:03	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "I do think it’s a bi..." 

 Agree! Independent of sfi'ing too early
01:29:27	terence:	can we revisit this in 2 weeks and have client teams all have a formal decision?
01:29:42	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I do think it’s a bi…"
@Potuz not sure I understand what you mean?
01:29:45	saulius:	Grandine is fine with CFI'ing FOCIL for Heka.

this UI sucks

I think it's unfair to 6 seconds
01:30:00	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Reacted to "this UI sucks" with 😂

01:30:08	nixo:	Replying to "Grandine is fine wit..."

the question is SFI
01:30:08	Marc:	I’m happy with SFI, need to double check with rest of nethermind team but generally think they support

OK sounds like it’s just going to ACDE
01:31:26	lightclient:	Everyone is okay with CFI, just make it CFI and we can discuss SFI in the future
