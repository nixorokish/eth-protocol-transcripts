00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.610
stokes: Hello.

2
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.060
stokes: Okay, let's give everyone another minute or two, and we'll get started.

3
00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.880
stokes: It is a holiday in the US, so…

4
00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.289
stokes: We might have fewer people today.

5
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.390
stokes: Than usual, but let's see what happens.

6
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.409
stokes: I was laughing with Terrence said.

7
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.340
stokes: And in the meantime… Let me check one thing…

8
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.000
stokes: Okay…

9
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.259
stokes: It's just earlier here.

10
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.849
stokes: Let's see. Let's give it one more minute, and then we'll get started.

11
00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.519
stokes: Okay, Josh, are you helping with the stream? And if so, then we are ready.

12
00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:07.750
Josh Davis: Alright, you're live.

13
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.280
stokes: Okay, thank you. So, welcome, everyone.

14
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:20.810
stokes: This is ACDC number 170. It is issue 1812 on the PM repo.

15
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:30.869
stokes: And, yeah, today, we should touch on Fusaka, the fork is coming up in just a few days, so we'll just touch on a few things there.

16
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.320
stokes: To get ready?

17
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.549
stokes: Then, we'll continue with Glamsterdam, and the big thing there would just be to continue Forkscopin.

18
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.500
stokes: So, let's go ahead and get into things.

19
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.180
stokes: With Fusaka.

20
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:53.700
stokes: So, yeah, first I'm just curious if there are any updates. I know we've been doing some mainnet shutoff forks, anything like that.

21
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.529
stokes: And… oh yeah, please.

22
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:07.080
Barnabas: Yeah, so we started, Ministry of Work 1, yesterday, and we went through full BP01 and BPO2,

23
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:17.379
Barnabas: with basically the same behavioral values that we are planning to do launch on midnight. So we did 15 mix blobs on BPO1, and 21 max blobs on BPO2.

24
00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:26.410
Barnabas: have been, spamming the network, here and there. Sometimes we shut off the spammers, sometimes we relaunch it in order to get,

25
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.389
Barnabas: some transactions from Minnet.

26
00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:36.940
Barnabas: And we have seen very close to 100% participation throughout the past, 24 hours.

27
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:41.099
Barnabas: The oil is looking good.

28
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.510
stokes: Okay.

29
00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:43.919
stokes: Great to hear.

30
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:51.140
stokes: Yeah, Barth has a question if we're using MedBoost, on mainnet Shadow Fork 1.

31
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:53.360
Barnabas: We are not.

32
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:54.640
Bharath: Okay.

33
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.460
stokes: Okay.

34
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.270
stokes: Cool.

35
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:04.420
stokes: So, then in that case…

36
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:13.009
stokes: Unless there are any other updates there. I did want to touch on this mainnet LAN.

37
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:21.330
stokes: Okay, I'm not sure which Chris this is, but they had a question about, Nimbus SuperNodes.

38
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.300
stokes: That seems relevant.

39
00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:40.909
Barnabas: Yeah, so we have been using their 25.11.0 on the Mini Shadow Fork, and that release has been pretty solid. They have made a new release, with the 25.12, that one at the bug.

40
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:51.939
Barnabas: And Nimbus was, gonna come out with a new, release yesterday or today. Yesterday they didn't, so hopefully today we have an update from them.

41
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:57.239
stokes: Okay, thanks. Yeah, Dustin, you have more to add?

42
00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:05.889
Dustin: So, I don't know, so I can respond to this, or if this is just… but yeah, I mean, we are working on this…

43
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:13.320
Dustin: On a do- on a… On release, it fixes a very specific issue that actually,

44
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.569
Dustin: Barnabas and some of the other testing there had found before, and…

45
00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.490
Dustin: That's going, going through final phases of…

46
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:28.439
Dustin: of that. We're… we are truly aiming to get something out as soon as possible on this. We're aware of the timeline.

47
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:36.759
stokes: Okay, great, yeah, cool, yeah, just keep us updated.

48
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:42.529
stokes: I imagine we'll need to update the EF blog post as well, so… yeah, I'll keep an eye out.

49
00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:54.729
Dustin: Yeah, yeah, that's… that's true. So, so this will probably be… first, I don't… this 25.12, by the way, maybe I'm misparsing what was said. We don't have that release, that sort of obviously would be…

50
00:09:54.740 --> 00:10:04.870
Dustin: it doesn't… December doesn't exist yet, but… but this would likely… we would be aiming for a 25.11.1 would be the likely version number on this, but anyway.

51
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.340
stokes: Yeah, thanks. Yeah, again, we'll keep an eye out. Good luck.

52
00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.510
Dustin: Yep, yep.

53
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:22.689
stokes: Great. Then, the next thing was the Husaka mainnet plan, and I dropped a link here in the chat. It's, again, here on the PM repo.

54
00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:38.229
stokes: And the main thing here is just coordinated incident response, so this is, something we added, with Pectra, again, just in case something does go wrong. It's very clear who's responsible for what, and how we can kind of proceed.

55
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:46.940
stokes: So… Some of the client teams have filled this out. Actually, I haven't checked this morning.

56
00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:50.289
stokes: So, okay, there's a few more PRs here.

57
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.620
stokes: And in any case, yeah, please…

58
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.219
stokes: Make a PR, so we just know who is responsible for what.

59
00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:07.299
stokes: And… yeah, I don't think there's much more to discuss here. I've sent messages to each individual client team, so…

60
00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:10.530
stokes: Yeah, just a reminder to…

61
00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:17.719
stokes: Get this ready, and… yeah, then in other… In other news, Fusaka…

62
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:25.080
stokes: We'll go live, in just a few days, so… Very exciting.

63
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.040
stokes: And…

64
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:35.149
stokes: Beyond that, I don't think I had anything. Is there anything else, people feel like we should discuss for Fusaka?

65
00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.000
stokes: Okay, cool.

66
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:57.050
stokes: I'm not sure, if there'll be any sort of, like, launch parties or anything, usually.

67
00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.449
stokes: someone does a livestream situation. So yeah, I guess we'll keep our eyes out for that.

68
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:13.950
stokes: But otherwise, I'm sure everyone will be watching the chain, when the fork happens, and yeah, let's hope for a good fork, and we'll go from there.

69
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:24.580
stokes: Alright, yeah, there's this one here, Nixo posted, and then, yeah, sounds like also another mine's planning to have one, so… cool.

70
00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:29.320
stokes: Should be fun. And again, fingers crossed for a smooth fork.

71
00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:32.710
stokes: Okay.

72
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:37.230
stokes: Then, if we're going to Fusaka, let's turn to Glamsterdam.

73
00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:51.909
stokes: And I want to just start just by asking if there's been any updates on DevNets. So, I know, last time we asked this question, yeah, kind of things are still in progress, and that might still be the case, but I figured I'd ask.

74
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:55.559
stokes: And in particular, I mean, DevNuts for EPBS.

75
00:12:57.780 --> 00:13:04.439
Stefan Starflinger: We've made a lot of progress with the tests, regarding, block-level access lists.

76
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.539
Stefan Starflinger: And I think 3 clients are passing pretty much all the tests now.

77
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:15.560
Stefan Starflinger: And I think we can start with DevNet soon. I'll be testing it in Kryptosis this week.

78
00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.589
stokes: Cool.

79
00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.320
stokes: Any updates on the EPBS side?

80
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:32.239
stokes: I think we had been thinking we would kind of have separate dev nets for the headliners, and then only once those are stable would we merge them into a Glenster Damnet.

81
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:47.049
Pari: Yeah, could we maybe get some updates from the EPBS research crew or plan teams on how the implementations are going?

82
00:13:48.420 --> 00:14:04.760
terence: We can give out the other precision sites, so we have a bunch of PRs that's open for the Beacon spec, and that's, like, in the process of getting reviewed and merged, but so far, most of them are passing the SPAC test. We just need to merge them to develop.

83
00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:10.950
terence: And then that's probably the biggest blocker, for Defnet Zero.

84
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:17.460
terence: And this moment, I think after Fusaka's shift, we'll see more, like, progress on that front.

85
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.530
terence: Yeah.

86
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.690
stokes: Er.

87
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:28.100
stokes: So, Prism and, any other clients?

88
00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.900
stokes: Has anyone else made implementation progress?

89
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.790
stokes: Okay, then yeah, so… That's.

90
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:51.099
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I can talk for tech or test stuff, any thoughts here. So, yeah, we've been…

91
00:14:51.890 --> 00:15:02.540
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): working on APBS in Teco for a while now, and we are merging things in master, which is good.

92
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:10.819
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): couple of weeks, we slowed down a little bit, but we are in a good shape. I think there are some…

93
00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:17.689
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Database-related and fortunate things to do, but most of the flows are actually kind of there.

94
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.330
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So… yeah, we feel good.

95
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:23.390
stokes: Okay.

96
00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:30.609
stokes: And then, yeah, Phil's just saying here, Lodestar, looking more like January, so…

97
00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:38.899
stokes: Okay, yeah, I mean, I think that's understandable, you know, everyone's focused on Fusaka, and otherwise, yeah, different,

98
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.900
stokes: Amounts of progress with different clients.

99
00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:47.580
stokes: King Yi saying here, steady progress in Lighthouse, so… Okay.

100
00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:50.270
stokes: Thank you, everyone.

101
00:15:50.920 --> 00:16:00.810
stokes: And on the topic of ePPS, so, there were actually quite a number of discussions last week at DevConnect around this feature of trustless payments.

102
00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:12.070
stokes: We've discussed this quite a bit on ACD, but I think now, as implementations have progressed, and especially other people in the community have had some time to look more at the feature.

103
00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.279
stokes: There are definitely some questions around the implications of this part of 7732.

104
00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.080
stokes: And…

105
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.070
stokes: Yeah, I think from here, I'll just hand it over to Alex, who wanted to say some things about this.

106
00:16:27.150 --> 00:16:43.940
alex: Yeah, sure. I think you pretty much nailed it. Last week during DevConnect, I talked to more people about it. I noticed that there was, like, various levels of understanding, and as, like, I tried my best to find the latest version of 7732 and what is and isn't possible, and…

107
00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:50.570
alex: make sure that, my view of it was accurate, and started talking to people about it. I noticed that there was definitely some

108
00:16:51.100 --> 00:17:01.960
alex: let's say just contention still within Fuse, actually lots of contention on all kinds of various parts. It mainly centers, I'd say, around process payments, but that definitely isn't the full picture yet.

109
00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:18.490
alex: I did my very best to talk to lots of client teams about this to see if they even wanted to have the discussion, or saw a reason in some of these, at least for me, new perspectives on why you may or may not want to ship this current version of 7732.

110
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:37.039
alex: what's been happening so far is more discussion. I wanted to flag that the next EPBS breakout call, I'm trying to push for and organizing, as a focal point to have some of these discussions and bring in some of the perspectives that, at least from my experience, talking to people, have not been fully hashed out yet.

111
00:17:37.670 --> 00:17:56.549
alex: And that's, I think, most of it. Just that maybe if you want to be involved in that discussion, and you do still see use in the different variants, like 7732 is there, some form of it will definitely go in, it looks like. But yeah, some people want to talk about which form still, and see if there is space. So yeah, you can reach me, I'll put my Telegram in the chat.

112
00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:11.380
alex: next week, December 5th, EPBS breakout call to talk about it, and I'll for sure be trying to make discussion happen already. Like, there's a Telegram channel I can add you to, and maybe Discord. The R&D Discord is also a natural place for some of the discussion to happen, so yeah.

113
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.589
alex: You know where to find me.

114
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:16.389
stokes: Great, thanks.

115
00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:24.000
stokes: So, yeah, if you want to look into this, again, next Friday during the PBS Breakout.

116
00:18:25.660 --> 00:18:31.280
stokes: And otherwise, yeah, there's, Alex's Telegram handle, so laser job.

117
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:32.330
stokes: Thank you.

118
00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:36.530
stokes: Okay.

119
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.360
stokes: And…

120
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:45.909
stokes: From there, and yeah, I mean, maybe just to be clear, I think the intent right now is just to discuss this design a bit more.

121
00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:54.779
stokes: I think we'd want to have that discussion before bringing it back to ACD and making any sort of, you know, decisions around scope or anything of the EIP, so…

122
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:57.540
stokes: Yeah.

123
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:58.930
stokes: Should be good there.

124
00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:02.490
stokes: Okay.

125
00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:08.039
stokes: Then… next up… I'd like to continue fork scraping.

126
00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:15.380
stokes: And… Yeah, so maybe I'll just play back, kind of where we're at.

127
00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.100
stokes: So, we have the headliners, we started scoping for the non-headliners.

128
00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.129
stokes: And… last call, which would have been 2 weeks ago.

129
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.830
stokes: We kind of went through a number of them. Client teams left some opinions on different EIPs.

130
00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:38.289
stokes: We were able to DFI one of them, lost call, I believe it was 8068.

131
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:43.019
stokes: Let me just make sure I have the right number… yeah, 8068.

132
00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.669
stokes: So that was deified, but then we still have quite a number on the CL side.

133
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.099
stokes: And we need to go ahead and pick the set that we would like.

134
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:57.660
stokes: to CFI for Amsterdam. So… I'd like to make progress here today.

135
00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:07.300
stokes: There have even been some changes, because there's kind of a bundle of EAPs that touch on consolidations, and the queues, and how those all fit together.

136
00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:15.169
stokes: Since the last call, Francesco has split something out into, sort of a more streamlined EIP with 8080,

137
00:20:15.770 --> 00:20:18.080
stokes: And in any case, yeah, we'll get to that.

138
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:27.429
stokes: Before we move through all of them, we should touch on Fossil, because this is where we left it during the last call, is that…

139
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:40.280
stokes: you know, due to scoping, and, you know, essentially the extra complexity it would bring to bundle with EPBS due to the testing overhead, the security overhead, all of the above.

140
00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:48.040
stokes: We said that if we could find a way to commit to it for Hecca, Bogota, so the fork after Amsterdam.

141
00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.149
stokes: That feels like a much better decision to make.

142
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.529
stokes: And that's kind of where we left it.

143
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.290
stokes: Yeah.

144
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:03.299
stokes: I guess before we move forward, I don't know if there's anything anyone would like to add around the fossil question.

145
00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:12.199
stokes: I'm not sure if there is. So, okay, then let's just move ahead, so…

146
00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.410
stokes: For this, yeah. So, I talked to some people last week, and…

147
00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:26.239
stokes: again, I think people are generally on board with this. The question is just, like, how do we actually make this credible commitment? So…

148
00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.259
stokes: you know, I think two straightforward options.

149
00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:40.440
stokes: We could either CFI fossil for Heika Bogota, made a meta AIP that, is not merged yet, but it exists, so, you know, we could just essentially make a PR to that PR.

150
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:47.120
stokes: You know, some people might not want CFI, and so in that case, we could also do SFI.

151
00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:50.710
stokes: Yeah, okay, people here in the chat saying, SFI.

152
00:21:51.450 --> 00:22:00.599
stokes: And… yeah. I mean, the thing… the difference here is, like, SFI is, like, a, you know, fairly stronger signal, which I do think mirrors the…

153
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:09.699
stokes: Demand for this feature, again, everyone… I mean, I don't think anyone has spoken against Fossil as an EIP. The question's more just when.

154
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:15.520
stokes: And, sure, you know, marrying that then, I think SFI for Heck of Bogota.

155
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.820
stokes: Makes a lot of sense. Yeah, so… I'd propose we do that.

156
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.820
stokes: Does anyone have any comments to what I just said?

157
00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.370
stokes: Turds.

158
00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:47.820
terence: If you want an SFI fossil, don't you also want, like, other contending, like, EIPs, for example, like, 6-second, or other EIPs that wanna, like, SFI to HACA also have, like, a fair chance as well, meaning, like, opening the floor to, like, restart the process for HACA, something like that?

159
00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:56.710
stokes: Yeah, I mean, this is a very good question. So, yeah, like, you mentioned 6-second slots, you know, there will be other EIPs we want to think about as headliners.

160
00:22:57.170 --> 00:23:00.430
stokes: And this is kind of the thing we need to sort out, so…

161
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:07.520
stokes: We don't want to, like, get ahead of ourselves, necessarily.

162
00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:18.870
stokes: And, yeah, I guess given, you know, the demand for Fossil, I think we could kind of carve out a special case here, where we say, yeah, we move ahead with SFI,

163
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:31.429
stokes: That doesn't mean we, you know, skipped the headliner process for HECA. We would still have that, you know, I think pretty soon. And then from there, you know, essentially the framing, at least to me, would be, hey, you know, this is, like.

164
00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:39.730
stokes: The strongest signal that we're sending is that fossils should be, you know, in the fork. Then from there, we can think about other things that go in the fork.

165
00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:46.630
stokes: You know, we touched upon this last call, but say, for example, there is a lot of demand for 6-second slots in Hecca.

166
00:23:47.460 --> 00:24:02.289
stokes: I think, you know, I do trust that if we start now, then it's much more likely to think about doing both, rather than, you know, say, the situation today with Amsterdam, where, as we saw, we're still very early in the DevNet process for EPBS.

167
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:04.050
stokes: So, again, it feels…

168
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:08.210
stokes: Much less wise to go ahead and sort of put two more headliners into the fork.

169
00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:16.390
stokes: Whereas, you know, I think, at least it feels to me, like there's more room to do this for HECA, especially if we sort of start today.

170
00:24:22.450 --> 00:24:23.670
stokes: So, yeah, maybe…

171
00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:34.480
Dima Gusakov | Lido: The thing is, if we not commit for fossil, but we do EPBS, and then we risk not including fossil, at least in the next hard fork.

172
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:44.590
Dima Gusakov | Lido: It creates a bit of a problem, again, at least for those running, nodes from home, running validators from home, with this, increased,

173
00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:49.609
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Up low at bandwidth for local block production.

174
00:24:49.870 --> 00:25:07.019
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And for me, it's very concerning if we agree on… like, we already agreed on doing EPBS, that's amazing. And if Fossil is not in Glamsterdam, I think it's… it will be a good decision to commit to have it in the next hard work, at least. Otherwise, we create a gap

175
00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:13.439
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And should fossil not make it into the next hard fork, this gap will be widened.

176
00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:24.539
Dima Gusakov | Lido: So, for me, it's kind of concerning to have EPBS without fossil. It's fine to have it, like, in two separate forks, but in two adjacent forks, not…

177
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.900
Dima Gusakov | Lido: But the bigger gap.

178
00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:29.080
stokes: Yeah.

179
00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:33.479
stokes: No, that's fair, and I think that's why we're trying to find a way to…

180
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.340
stokes: signal today that it would go into Hecca?

181
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:44.090
stokes: And that all being said, yeah, there's a number of comments in the chat here around…

182
00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.860
stokes: Yeah, different, different aspects to this.

183
00:25:50.950 --> 00:26:01.710
stokes: Yeah, maybe to drive the conversation forward, so let's say we SFI'd it today, but, you know, the understanding is that we still have the headliner process to consider with other EIPs.

184
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.539
stokes: Does this seem okay to people?

185
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.940
stokes: Yo, Barnabas.

186
00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:18.680
Barnabas: Yeah, so I think we might need to rethink our…

187
00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:37.539
Barnabas: total process, how we decide which EIP should make into which fork. What we need to actually do is, if you're going to be doing two forks a year going forward, then we need to have much better pipelining, so that means that we need to dedicate specific EIPs for N plus 1 fork a lot sooner.

188
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:41.430
Barnabas: And, yeah, we… I think we just, like.

189
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:50.850
Barnabas: just need to change the way we think about the IP scoping, and maybe we can shorten the time for making decisions.

190
00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.650
stokes: Yeah.

191
00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.570
stokes: I mean, okay, so that…

192
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:09.359
stokes: kind of suggest another way forward, if people want to think about this in the context of, like, other EIPs, is we would essentially, you know, do the HECA BOGA telescoping, like, much sooner than otherwise.

193
00:27:10.250 --> 00:27:16.789
stokes: Then the question is, how do we square this with Glencer Dam? And… Yeah, I think it's… yeah.

194
00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:23.410
stokes: It might be a little… little tricky. So…

195
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.370
stokes: Yeah, thinking about what to move… how to… how to move forward here.

196
00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.159
stokes: So, okay, I mean, one thing we could do is just take this as a given.

197
00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:46.400
stokes: I don't know if we're gonna reach consensus on this call today, on Fossil.

198
00:27:46.550 --> 00:27:49.739
stokes: Which means we probably won't finalize the Amsterdam scope.

199
00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:55.409
stokes: But that would be one path forward, is, you know, we could talk about the rest of the EIPs today for your Amsterdam.

200
00:27:55.710 --> 00:28:01.670
stokes: And then from there, we could start thinking about ecoscoping, because, yeah, I agree with you, Barnabas, that…

201
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:08.049
stokes: we don't necessarily have the tools, at least, okay, we do have the tools, because we could CFI, we could even SFI.

202
00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.629
stokes: But… Sounds like that makes some people uncomfortable.

203
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.520
stokes: So… We could start that process.

204
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:24.209
stokes: Then the question is just, you know, if we don't get to a reasonable heca scope that people are happy with, then it would essentially roll back to the clamp stream scoping.

205
00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:27.589
stokes: So… There's some risk there.

206
00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.930
stokes: And yeah, just going from the chat, there's…

207
00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.670
stokes: Certainly just, yeah, I think we're pretty split on this as a group.

208
00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.180
stokes: Like, plant…

209
00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.429
lightclient: Yeah, I just propose that we…

210
00:28:47.670 --> 00:28:53.219
lightclient: start moving forward. I think that it's too contentious to go into Glamster Dam. That's…

211
00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.699
lightclient: You know, objective at this point.

212
00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:00.760
lightclient: And the best we can do is… CFI.

213
00:29:00.930 --> 00:29:11.969
lightclient: For HECA. There's really no other commitment that we can actually make. We can SFI it, but that honestly just dilutes the meaning of SFI, because we really can't

214
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:15.579
lightclient: Decide what is going to go into the fork this far out.

215
00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:20.539
lightclient: And without doing the actual headlining identification process.

216
00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:24.900
stokes: Yeah.

217
00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:34.180
stokes: That does seem like a reasonable path forward to me, just given, yeah, the process we have and how things work.

218
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:43.210
stokes: But that all being said, I know, you know, given the demand for this, I'm open to finding other creative solutions.

219
00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.170
stokes: I think it was Kaspar, so I spoke, and then Anskar.

220
00:29:48.880 --> 00:30:07.780
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: Yeah, I just want to point out that on last ACDC, the discussion was whether fossil should go into Glamsterdam, because there's already pretty broad support from a lot of clients. Obviously, also some voices, a lot of voices against, but point being, the discussion was anchored on whether Fossil goes into Glamsterdam.

221
00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:16.729
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: And as a compromise, We wanted to explore a credible commitment for Fossil in Hakka.

222
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:22.060
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: And if we cannot find that, then I think the discussion needs to go back whether

223
00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:24.769
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: to whether fossil should go into Glamsterdam or not.

224
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:30.350
lightclient: I mean, we can have the conversation of fossil going into Glamsterdam, but…

225
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:32.689
lightclient: it's not gonna go into Amsterdam.

226
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:36.659
lightclient: It's already clear there's too much contention for it to go in.

227
00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:40.539
lightclient: So, there's not really anything else to do, as far as I can tell.

228
00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:45.850
stokes: Yeah, so I spoke.

229
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:53.180
soispoke: Yeah, I mean, I agree. I, I think… Cfi, basically.

230
00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:55.650
soispoke: You know, the process changed quite a bit.

231
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:59.269
soispoke: So it's, it's also, like, hard to follow.

232
00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:13.840
soispoke: you know, when the process changes, and for what reason, but I think it's pretty clear that CFI-ing has become a bit meaningless. Like, it's… for fossil, for example, like, program for them, it's been

233
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:16.770
soispoke: Basically, more of a, like, on hold…

234
00:31:16.910 --> 00:31:31.459
soispoke: status than any sort of, like, credible commitment for inclusion, and we can see that very clearly. So I think… I don't think there is, like, no alternative path, like, I think an alternative path is to SFI for school for HSTAR.

235
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:33.640
soispoke: If not for Glamstadam.

236
00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:41.629
soispoke: yeah, for me, it's just, like, CFI for, for, for Hecker.

237
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:44.859
soispoke: It's not equal to a credible commitment.

238
00:31:45.050 --> 00:31:56.380
soispoke: Like, we are… we are saying we want to get better at pipelining. We are saying the main reason, like, for Soul is not going to be included in Glamstad is, like, for scope and complexity.

239
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.840
soispoke: I think if that's the only reason.

240
00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:05.939
soispoke: And we ship folks on a, like, faster cadence anyways, why wouldn't we able to credibly commit

241
00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.800
soispoke: And improve pipelining to… to…

242
00:32:08.970 --> 00:32:22.069
soispoke: SFI-ing for sulfur for Hecar. I think, like, otherwise, like, you can't just, like, change the process whenever it fits with what you sort of, like, want to include. It just gets very confusing.

243
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:26.550
stokes: Bansgar.

244
00:32:26.670 --> 00:32:27.729
stokes: And then Excel.

245
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:40.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I personally think that the debate is a little bit mis-focused, when, to me, the credit commitment is already a bit of a strange term. I mean, obviously, we like that in crypto, but I…

246
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:48.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: don't think what we want, really, here is to somehow make the process force us to include this in H-star, because

247
00:32:49.030 --> 00:32:50.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: If there ever, like…

248
00:32:50.770 --> 00:33:10.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think it's… it's a super fringe outcome where we all, in the end, in 6 months, are here, and we no longer wanted an age star. If that were to happen, then something clearly must have happened in between that really changed our mind. Maybe someone found a really big flaw in Fossil, or, like, we have a new proposal, and it's not quite ready, or what… who knows, right? Like, it would have to be a very different world.

249
00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:11.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: For us to…

250
00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:22.469
Ansgar Dietrichs: to be in that position, and so it makes no sense to me to really try to find a process tool to basically commit us to including. I think the main level of

251
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:30.279
Ansgar Dietrichs: comfort or confidence that people here were looking for is just, do we, as core devs, all agree?

252
00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:44.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: And I think the answer is clearly yes, right? Everyone here wants it in H-star, and I think that is what matters. I feel like we're kind of, like… it's a complete sidetrack to find a process. It's also a hack of the… like, we should never pre-commit

253
00:33:44.200 --> 00:34:03.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: like, this early on. And if we CFI it now, I think CFI makes a lot of sense. Of course, it doesn't mean it's guaranteed, but it is basically guaranteed, because we all very strongly want it in the fog, and so any work that's starting now for… in preparation of H-star will already make the clear assumption that it will be based on fossil, and I think that's very productive.

254
00:34:06.890 --> 00:34:11.199
stokes: Yeah, and maybe, you know, just to go down the CFI path a bit more, like.

255
00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:23.109
stokes: we could add a note, I don't know, there could be some, like, special designation that, even in the MedAP says, hey, like, you know, everyone expects this to definitely be included, so…

256
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:29.179
stokes: There are ways to, yeah, strengthen, strengthen the language, and hopefully then the commitment.

257
00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:30.850
stokes: Nixa.

258
00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:44.449
nixo: Here's my proposal, is that we… between this call and the next ACDC, we outline the next headliner process, because we've only gone through this… this headliner process once. We don't really have, like, a clear

259
00:34:44.969 --> 00:34:59.700
nixo: consensus of what it has to look like. So instead of this headliner process presenting 8 to 10 headliners that we choose from, we have two decisions to make. The first is, is Fossil the headliner?

260
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:11.010
nixo: That's a yes or no. It's in… it only is a no if people feel strong opposition that in this… in the time between now and H-star, things have significantly changed.

261
00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:24.329
nixo: Second decision is what is the headliner that may accompany Fossil. And this way, it's a… it's a more credible commitment without having bypassed the meanings that we… that we

262
00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:37.379
nixo: outlined for SFI and CFI, while also giving time for people outside of the 68 people in this call to decide what the headliner for H-star is going to be.

263
00:35:40.530 --> 00:35:44.629
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I think that's probably the most, sort of, by-the-book thing.

264
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:51.339
stokes: I would… Be a little concerned that it would be rushed to do the headliners, like, now.

265
00:35:51.550 --> 00:36:01.500
stokes: And then it could be the case that, yeah, we get to a headliner set for Pekka, and fossil's not there, and then it, like, ripples back through everything.

266
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:06.240
stokes: But, that being said, perhaps we should just try.

267
00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:09.810
stokes: And… yeah, I mean, again, I think it's…

268
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:15.180
stokes: I think we have a good sense of what our headliners are that we'd at least want to think about.

269
00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.070
stokes: Tony?

270
00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:29.599
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I would agree with what Amska just said. It feels like CFI-ing would be the right decision, because we don't know, where we are in 6 months, or next year sometime.

271
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:40.900
Toni Wahrstätter: So, yeah, it feels like the commitment the clients gave, which is, supporting it in Amsterdam on a conditional basis, is already a commitment, enough.

272
00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.040
stokes: Okay.

273
00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:58.029
stokes: So, in terms of moving forward, what I would say is that I think we should go ahead and assume, as of this call, that Fossil will not go into Glamsterdam.

274
00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:05.159
stokes: From here, I do think there's a question of, do we want to CFI, do we want to SFI?

275
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:09.730
stokes: Or do we even want to go ahead and just, you know, move through the headliner process for HECA?

276
00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:19.530
stokes: I would propose we take that async, and then try to get to some resolution, again, asynchronously before the next call.

277
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:22.850
stokes: In terms of how to move forward. And…

278
00:37:23.770 --> 00:37:29.350
stokes: for example, I could go ahead and make a PR to the Medi IP in the next week,

279
00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:35.500
stokes: That would, yeah, do SFI or CFI, and that can be a place we can take some discussion there.

280
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:41.549
stokes: Separately, yeah, I can reach out to everyone and try to get a sense of what's the best path forward.

281
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:46.940
stokes: So… Does that seem okay?

282
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.129
stokes: And yeah, I mean, Delight clients…

283
00:37:51.240 --> 00:38:00.620
stokes: point here in the chat about making a decision, I think, you know, this is essentially DFI, but conditional on finding the right configuration.

284
00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.210
stokes: So I spoke.

285
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:08.309
soispoke: Yeah, I mean, I do feel like, at this point, I don't want to, like.

286
00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.520
soispoke: Be difficult or something, but it feels like it's been…

287
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:20.570
soispoke: maybe 6 months, or, like, over… over 6 months, then, like, people… people have supported fossil generally, and…

288
00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:22.000
soispoke: every time…

289
00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:30.950
soispoke: Like, it is a bit contentious, and every time we sort of, like, keep delaying making decisions about it,

290
00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.459
soispoke: And I don't know if, like, sentiment is gonna change from now

291
00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:47.940
soispoke: Compared to, like, two weeks later, basically, so I'm… I'm, like, feels like, you know, like, it's very clear what the trade-offs are,

292
00:38:48.190 --> 00:39:06.219
soispoke: everyone is, like, pretty clear on, like, what people want, and… and… and, like, from now on, like, it feels like every time we have a conversation about Fossil, it's more like, okay, yeah, maybe let's see if I put it on hold. It was, like, that for the headliners, and it's exactly that for, like, the non-headliner EIPs.

293
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.649
soispoke: And then it's gonna be exactly the same for HECA.

294
00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:18.440
soispoke: I just feel like at some point, like, it doesn't really mean anything anymore to delay processes and decisions, so…

295
00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:22.790
stokes: Okay.

296
00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:33.210
stokes: Yeah, I mean, if I had to make a decision right now, I would say DFI for Glenster Dam, and SFI for HECA, and then we just move forward with that.

297
00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:39.190
stokes: And we'll just have to accommodate that for the headliner process, you know, say in a couple months when we get to it.

298
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:45.520
stokes: Okay.

299
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.799
stokes: There's a clap emoji. Is everyone okay with that?

300
00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.499
stokes: I think that seems to be the thing that swears most of the sides.

301
00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:58.289
stokes: Okay. I'm getting a lot of positive reactions.

302
00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:08.020
stokes: So… okay. Then let's do that, and just to repeat it to be clear, DFI Fossil for Glenster Dam.

303
00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.620
stokes: I will make an SFI PR for Hecca Bogota for Fossil.

304
00:40:12.930 --> 00:40:14.810
stokes: And then, yeah, you know…

305
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:22.579
stokes: The point being is this is, you know, I think the strongest signal we can make today, for the headliner process for Hecca Bogota, again, in a couple months.

306
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:25.830
stokes: Yeah, and then we'll move forward.

307
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:34.870
stokes: Again, I… think the sentiment around inclusion is clear, and again, maybe just to make it abundantly clear, like.

308
00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:38.270
stokes: This is the thing people want to ship in Amsterdam.

309
00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:43.079
stokes: They might want to also ship other things, and then it's… they're sorry, in HECA.

310
00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:49.930
stokes: Let me start over. To make it abundantly clear, the sentiment is to ship this in ECA, this being fossil.

311
00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:59.999
stokes: There might be other things we want to ship, and we're gonna have to figure out, you know, how to square those two down the line, but again, I think, given that we're starting today, there's a really straightforward path to do that.

312
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.510
stokes: Okay.

313
00:41:04.850 --> 00:41:05.560
stokes: Great.

314
00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:11.339
stokes: From here, Let's move to the rest of the EIPs.

315
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:17.159
stokes: And, let me just find the agenda. It floated off somewhere.

316
00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:18.769
stokes: So, okay.

317
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:26.099
stokes: From here, yeah, there's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 other CLEIPs for Amsterdam.

318
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.770
stokes: And…

319
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:42.699
stokes: Yeah, I think in terms of moving forward, so there is a bundle of things here around the term limits and consolidations and how they work with exits and all the above.

320
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:50.420
stokes: There has been an update here, because we said we would split out, I think it was a leaner version of 8061 into 8080.

321
00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.610
stokes: Is Francesco on the call? Because he could give us some more context on what he did there.

322
00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.130
stokes: Or if someone else is aware of… oh, actually, Francesca might not be here today.

323
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:08.109
stokes: Okay then we'll move…

324
00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:10.219
Mikhail Kalinin: I can probably speak a little bit on that.

325
00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.180
stokes: Oh, sure. Yeah, that'd be helpful, thanks.

326
00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.340
Mikhail Kalinin: So…

327
00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:23.150
Mikhail Kalinin: Yes, the 8080 is basically, allows to use the consolidation queue, for exits, when the exit queue

328
00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:29.059
Mikhail Kalinin: is longer than the consolidation queue. That's basically what it does.

329
00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:36.700
Mikhail Kalinin: And, it's, also fixed to the problem that the 8071, fixes.

330
00:42:36.830 --> 00:42:46.770
Mikhail Kalinin: And, in my opinion, 88 is strictly better than 8071, so I would prefer it to replace the previous EIP.

331
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:48.270
Mikhail Kalinin: So…

332
00:42:49.350 --> 00:42:49.940
stokes: Okay.

333
00:42:50.010 --> 00:42:53.979
Mikhail Kalinin: And, could someone remind me how Yeah, sorry.

334
00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:55.250
stokes: No, go ahead.

335
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:58.759
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, it just basically does the only this thing.

336
00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:01.490
stokes: Okay.

337
00:43:03.170 --> 00:43:09.510
stokes: Great. And how does 8061 relate to 8080? That part, I haven't had time to dig into.

338
00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:24.570
Mikhail Kalinin: It's, AT61 was proposing to basically do the same, to reuse, to use consolidation queue for exits, but it also does other things, like, increasing the,

339
00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:30.009
Mikhail Kalinin: exit queue. The most recent version of 8061, basically.

340
00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:40.460
Mikhail Kalinin: Keeps the activation queue the same as it is today, but increases the exit queue and also allows to use consolidation queue as the exits.

341
00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:48.019
Mikhail Kalinin: So that's… that's a bit different, the IP. It changes the queue, and it changes the acceptability period.

342
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.380
stokes: Okay.

343
00:43:52.960 --> 00:44:02.739
stokes: So, then in that case, I think it'd be fair to say that we have 8080 to replace 8071, and yeah, that tracks with what I remember from the last call.

344
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:11.210
stokes: I think then we would also want to think about 8061 and 8080 together, so it's not that one replaces the other.

345
00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:20.190
Mikhail Kalinin: Right, so 8080 is an alternative to 8071, but not an alternative to 8061.

346
00:44:20.930 --> 00:44:21.550
stokes: Okay.

347
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:23.179
stokes: Thank you.

348
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:25.680
stokes: Potus?

349
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:33.060
Potuz: Yeah, I just want to remind that there was some pushback against, 8061, and that's why 8080 was,

350
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:46.910
Potuz: was proposed, and we… we were one of the ones pushing against 8061. 80… 8080 seems to us as a better fix for the problem that 8071 would fix, so…

351
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:59.779
Potuz: My personal preference, I'm not sure if President is behind this, but I suspect they are, would be to go with 8080 and GFI 8061 and 8071.

352
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:08.720
stokes: Okay, and just to be clear, we would lose, this change to the trim limits themselves.

353
00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.590
stokes: Right.

354
00:45:09.590 --> 00:45:25.160
Potuz: Right, so the problem with that… well, there was… yeah, there were a few things. I mean, whether or not we had enough of a discussion about the sensitivity period, and also that it touches… I mean, it's a deeper change than the simpler change, just the helper.

355
00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:32.580
Potuz: on updating the churn, and compute the exit, and update the churn that 8080 does. 8080 is a very simple change.

356
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.810
stokes: Okay.

357
00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:48.699
Anders Elowsson: Maybe… Yeah, so essentially, it's sort of an efficient way to ensure that we use the SHARN.

358
00:45:49.010 --> 00:46:04.690
Anders Elowsson: But I haven't really… did you… because as we were discussing, things during the last, call, I felt like the discussion was that, that you guys would, sort of,

359
00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:20.119
Anders Elowsson: maybe… maybe consider what… what kind of weeks of activity you find acceptable, and maybe have some input on that for this talk, or something like this. Did anyone make any further considerations on that? Because, I mean.

360
00:46:20.330 --> 00:46:29.209
Anders Elowsson: Just increasingly showing in general would be positive right now, because we want to ensure that we don't have so long queues. Maybe someone has input on that.

361
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:34.240
stokes: Yeah, does anyone?

362
00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.529
stokes: I'm not sure what DevConnect people have had time.

363
00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:44.209
stokes: But I do agree it would be nice to consider. Greg?

364
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:52.880
Greg K | Lido: Yeah, so I think because the discussion goes to, kind of, the technical details of these alternatives, so I guess what is…

365
00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:09.309
Greg K | Lido: agreement is that, we all agree that we should fix this consolidation queue issue. Like, also, in light of we had identified this and report to Francesco, that, like, this feature is unintended and it exists.

366
00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:27.789
Greg K | Lido: But, like, for both those alternatives, I think there is some kind of extra discussion, so I'm okay, let's say, for 8080, but we also have some extra comments on it, like, not as it is now, but with… after some edits. But yeah, through DevConnect, we didn't have time to properly, you know.

367
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:34.829
Greg K | Lido: review. So, I'm not sure if we can now, like, in this call today, make a final decision

368
00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:49.159
Greg K | Lido: on with CAP, we could keep the agreement that one of those will be here… will be there, definitely, to fix this issue, and perhaps have a specialized breakout call to discuss these technical details, because I don't think that now is the time to discuss

369
00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:53.369
Greg K | Lido: the details of them. I don't know what others think about it.

370
00:47:54.270 --> 00:48:02.970
Greg K | Lido: So they just, like, agree that one of them will be definitely there, we cannot deify all of them, that this will not happen, but, have some

371
00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:06.340
Greg K | Lido: Additional discussion on it, but not now.

372
00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:12.459
stokes: Yeah, I mean, we might want both, just to throw it out there. Anders.

373
00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:27.009
Anders Elowsson: No, I just want to say, yeah, so… so 8080, it gives us both things from… that we wanted from 71 and 61, so it gives us both. So from that perspective, we might be satisfied with just 880, but we can also consider 61.

374
00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:36.709
stokes: Yeah, and maybe just to play back my understanding, we'd want 8061 if we also want to change the… increase the churn itself.

375
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:45.029
stokes: It seems like there's pretty broad agreement on 8080 as a way to fix, this issue that 8071 set out to fix.

376
00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:46.740
stokes: Potus.

377
00:48:47.860 --> 00:49:04.799
Potuz: I'm sorry, I was gonna say your last sentence, that we can probably DFI 8071 right now, and then… I mean, if people still want to delay this discussion, we can discuss later whether we go with 8061 or 8080, assuming that we're gonna take one of the two.

378
00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:09.080
Potuz: So these… these two commitments, I think we can… we're ready to make today.

379
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:15.590
stokes: Yeah, I agree with the DFI and 8070, so yeah, let's go ahead and do that.

380
00:49:19.610 --> 00:49:22.990
stokes: Is there appetite for both 8080 and 8061?

381
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:29.350
stokes: And really, the thing I want us to consider is just increasing the churn limits, which I don't think 8080 does by itself right now.

382
00:49:29.990 --> 00:49:39.910
Potuz: But isn't… so I thought… I haven't checked if 8061 has changed, but I assumed that 8080 was just a subset of 8061, that it's just removed.

383
00:49:39.910 --> 00:49:44.370
stokes: So that's my understanding, yeah. But I don't think it touches the Chinese one, right?

384
00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:48.979
Potuz: I thought 8080 is the substance.

385
00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:57.080
stokes: Okay, that was the… yeah, yeah, I see what you're saying. So the contention was actually with the churn limits, and so we took both the nice things out into ADA. Okay.

386
00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:06.549
Potuz: Right, so 8080, I think, is consensus that is the right fix for 8071, and 8061 might have extra stuff that we may or may not like.

387
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:08.350
stokes: Yeah.

388
00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.900
stokes: So…

389
00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:22.160
stokes: I would actually go ahead and say CFI for 8080, because I think we feel good on that, and I think we'll need another call to think about changing the churn limits.

390
00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.190
stokes: So then I would kind of propose we do that.

391
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:28.720
stokes: I guess the one thing is if…

392
00:50:28.930 --> 00:50:36.529
stokes: the only extra bit of 8061 is the turn limits, and we decide we want that, then we do 8061 instead of 8080, but…

393
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.060
stokes: That seems… yeah, like something we need to figure that out.

394
00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.440
stokes: Yeah. Okay.

395
00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:54.889
stokes: So, maybe in terms of process then, we'll just leave both of them alone, and yeah, the ask would be, we will decide on the next call, so we need to figure out

396
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.829
stokes: How to adjust the turn limits, if we want to do that.

397
00:50:58.940 --> 00:51:01.150
stokes: So… okay.

398
00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.410
stokes: DFO 8071.

399
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:11.990
stokes: 8080 or 8061. We will CFI one of those, or yeah, some combination of things here.

400
00:51:12.270 --> 00:51:19.359
stokes: It just sounds like, even from the chat and what people have said today, we need a little more time to dig into that. So we'll do that.

401
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:29.889
stokes: So… There's a question from Greg, just keep the… Point, that's spec updates.

402
00:51:30.140 --> 00:51:39.180
stokes: Yeah, I mean, so, it just… the thing is, I think the Slack updates we want to make to 8080 would just get us back to 8061, so, like, we can just figure it out.

403
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:44.050
stokes: But I think what we can say today is, like, we'll CFI something between these two.

404
00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.130
stokes: And we will define that something on the next call.

405
00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:48.990
stokes: Two weeks from today.

406
00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:54.229
stokes: So… okay. I think we're pretty good there.

407
00:51:55.050 --> 00:52:01.859
stokes: The next one in this direction of touching, different staking mechanics would be 8062.

408
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:07.900
stokes: This is adding… I think it was, like, a 5 BIPS withdrawal fee, on the sweep for 00…

409
00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.850
stokes: One validators during their withdrawal process.

410
00:52:11.950 --> 00:52:21.049
stokes: This one is interesting. I think, from what I recall from client opinions on the last call, there was kind of, yeah, a mixed, mixed view here.

411
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:27.199
stokes: I will say we had, at least, you know, I saw some of our conversations last week at DevConnect.

412
00:52:27.330 --> 00:52:34.149
stokes: And sentiments seem to be against us, if only because it feels a bit early.

413
00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.870
stokes: The main thing this EIP would set out to do, as far as I see, is drive more consolidations more quickly.

414
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:59.690
stokes: And yeah, again, just talking to different validators and, you know, just generally people in the community last week, it sounds like the issue is not so much that, it's not so much, like, an economic thing that's ruining consolidations, it's more the tooling, and so that seems to suggest people just need more time.

415
00:53:00.110 --> 00:53:04.210
stokes: So, again, I could see something like 8062 at some point.

416
00:53:04.570 --> 00:53:07.070
stokes: Personally, it feels a bit early to do now.

417
00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:09.470
stokes: What do others think?

418
00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.870
stokes: Yeah, Anders?

419
00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:25.280
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, concerning timelines, yeah, so it would be… if we… if we do Glamsterdam in, say, I don't know when it happens, 8… 8 months from now, or something like that.

420
00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:36.879
Anders Elowsson: I think we need to be a bit forward-looking and consider the fact that it's not something that's gonna take place now, it's gonna take place in quite some time, and that

421
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:46.659
Anders Elowsson: once we get to H-star, it's going to have to… have taken quite a long time until we have some incentives in place, and I…

422
00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:55.139
Anders Elowsson: Of course, I agree with the notion that there are plenty of staking service providers that will

423
00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.850
Anders Elowsson: We'll switch over.

424
00:53:58.180 --> 00:54:01.890
Anders Elowsson: to compounding validators. I have no doubt about that.

425
00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:08.580
Anders Elowsson: And that they are working on it right now, but I am also fairly certain that there are

426
00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:28.669
Anders Elowsson: many, many setups and some saying service providers to have a certain proportion of their stake that they do not intend to move over and compound and consolidate. At least, that's the impression I've gotten from the conversations right now. And so my point would be,

427
00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:39.189
Anders Elowsson: That we… we should really signal that we want them to move over, and the way to signal that is to impose a very small

428
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:48.049
Anders Elowsson: the first kind of fear, because as I've said before, it's more profitable for you to stay on

429
00:54:48.060 --> 00:55:06.119
Anders Elowsson: on the sweep validators, if you have, for example, 128 ETH that you're sticking on 4 sweep validators, and you could consolidate into one 128 ETH validator, you would have better capital efficiency, as it is right now, on the sweep validators.

430
00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:11.229
Anders Elowsson: Although it's not, of course, 100% certain that you know what you want to do with that.

431
00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:23.259
Anders Elowsson: additional capital, but we can presume that you, perhaps, will have some profitable avenue for spending that capital, so… so that's just my point that I want to say there, but I'm open to the conversation there.

432
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:26.690
stokes: Okay, thanks. Dima?

433
00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:44.819
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Yeah, so, the problem with OX01 validators and with these, like, it's not just the fact that, some saving providers, or most of the staging providers, are not consolidating validators because it's more profitable for that.

434
00:55:45.010 --> 00:56:00.969
Dima Gusakov | Lido: it is way more to it. So, first of all, like, from the solo staker's perspective, and from the conversations that I also got last week, like, a lot of solo stakers indicated that for them, for example, it is crucial to have predictable income.

435
00:56:00.970 --> 00:56:08.900
Dima Gusakov | Lido: That is… that gets materialized on their execution layer wallet, because at the end of the day, they need to pay bills.

436
00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:21.100
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And with, since most of them are not super nodes capable of having, like, 2K ETH, which we discussed multiple times here, this is a very huge pile of money.

437
00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:42.990
Dima Gusakov | Lido: The only option for them, should they consolidate to all XO2, is to use partial withdrawals, and with the current withdrawal queue, partial withdrawals share this… the same queue, or at least they… I mean, it's not that predictable, so this is the take from solo stakers. They do need sweep, because they do need predictable

438
00:56:43.710 --> 00:57:05.859
Dima Gusakov | Lido: rewards on their execution layer wallet, which is understandable. And that might be solved with, say, custom ceilings for OX02, so that once you consolidate, you can also set the suite threshold, which would for sure be higher than 32 ETH, but at the same time, it will fit your needs. So imagine you are a solo staker with 4 validators, you will be able to set it at

439
00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:16.550
Dima Gusakov | Lido: I don't know, 128 ETH or so, and still do, like, do both, so benefit for the network, because at the end of the day, you cannot consolidate more than you have.

440
00:57:16.690 --> 00:57:40.620
Dima Gusakov | Lido: and you get predictable withdrawals. The same problem, or kind of the same problem, is also true for professional operators. So the second comment here will be from professional operators who work with their clients. And even though at the dashboards it might seem that, I don't know, Figment, P2P, or whoever else, they own a huge pile of capital, and they have a lot at stake.

441
00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:54.970
Dima Gusakov | Lido: internally, this stake is not owned by them, so their clients, they prefer to have control over withdrawal credentials in most cases, which means that if their client does not have 2K ETH,

442
00:57:54.970 --> 00:58:08.789
Dima Gusakov | Lido: It means that for them, again, consolidating validator means changing the conditions or the terms that they have in between them and the client, where, for example, the client was previously getting these rewards on a regular basis.

443
00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:19.570
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And now, with, with their validators being consolidated, but not up to 2K, they will not get this rewards, which would involve, like, changes to, again.

444
00:58:20.250 --> 00:58:42.109
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Oh my god, the contracts, and so on and so forth. And the last thing, and this is probably the thing that I'm the closest to, is for the staking protocols like LiDAR, there are modules, like community staking module, where with the current OX02 design, it's practically unfeasible to transition to OX02,

445
00:58:42.110 --> 00:58:48.130
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Because of the way how bonded validators are, how fractional staking works, because you will need to…

446
00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:57.520
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Have sort of a regular update process or whatever else that would increase bond requirement as the validator balance increases.

447
00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:05.180
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And, for example, without custom ceilings, without any, like, feasible option here to

448
00:59:05.290 --> 00:59:17.640
Dima Gusakov | Lido: have a predictable amount of ETH on the consolidated validator, which is guaranteed by the network, Lido will simply not be able to transition any of CSM validators to OX02,

449
00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:29.500
Dima Gusakov | Lido: Just because of this limitation. So, I would say that even though the… I fully share the intent, and I fully believe that most of the network should be consolidated.

450
00:59:29.650 --> 00:59:49.030
Dima Gusakov | Lido: But there are some parts that cannot be consolidated with the current design of OX02, and we should take it into account. And instead of creating a disincentive for OX01 validators, so that people will be in a situation where their condition got worse, and they are forced, somehow forced to migrate to OX02,

451
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:59.839
Dima Gusakov | Lido: I would propose to think about how can we improve OX02 design so that it will fit the needs of the majority of the ecosystem players, and we will

452
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:14.740
Dima Gusakov | Lido: eventually end up with, I don't know, with evolutionary transition to OX02, rather than forceful transition, where we simply impose restrictions or penalties on the OX0101 validators.

453
01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:18.010
Anders Elowsson: Yeah.

454
01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.700
stokes: Yeah, Anders.

455
01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:26.190
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so I think we are in broad agreement that we should have this, sort of,

456
01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:30.459
Anders Elowsson: User, tunable, ceiling.

457
01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:39.630
Anders Elowsson: So… so I wouldn't, I wouldn't say that, there's any disagreement there, and we can, sort of, for this discussion.

458
01:00:39.890 --> 01:00:48.420
Anders Elowsson: assume that perhaps we will try to achieve that for H star, but my point is that

459
01:00:49.710 --> 01:01:00.929
Anders Elowsson: Well, it's just my… I don't think that we will reach the sort of consolidation that we need, even with such ceilings. And that's why I…

460
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.309
Anders Elowsson: When we have two options, then, for, for, for,

461
01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:20.589
Anders Elowsson: for facilitating consolidation. The one option is to sort of reward, stakers for having larger… larger validators, and the other one, which is proposed done in 1862, is to sort of,

462
01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:35.440
Anders Elowsson: incentivize them to move over and, in that way, consolidate without specifically rewarding bigger validators or smaller validators. So that's essentially the rationale for doing AT62, but

463
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:57.289
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so that's what I wanted to say about that, but I can see, of course, the point can be, like, oh, before… since we do not have, that, that tunable threshold that you can set yourself, then, okay, then we should not do the incentives before that, but the way I see it is also that

464
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:58.180
Anders Elowsson: Hi.

465
01:01:58.320 --> 01:01:59.590
Anders Elowsson: this, yeah.

466
01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:09.709
Anders Elowsson: I fear that we will delay finality… fast finality by not trying to, sort of, be a bit more…

467
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:11.170
Anders Elowsson: Yeah.

468
01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:16.319
Anders Elowsson: forceful on this issue, which will be a big degradation for Ethereum.

469
01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.519
stokes: Bunner to go.

470
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:28.029
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I just want to say that I was resonating to Dima's last comment, saying that

471
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:39.679
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): we should make new things, improve, instead of adding… forcing people to move via penalties. It's just features.

472
01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:48.269
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): That needs to be improved to make everything better on the other side. A part of that, maybe I'm not…

473
01:02:48.700 --> 01:02:54.249
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): fully, grasping the reason why 02

474
01:02:56.130 --> 01:03:08.189
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): has an impact on fast finality. I don't know, if we kinda introduce the least limit on the 02, then we fall into the same category of problem where

475
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:14.830
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): There are a lot of sweeps and withdrawals, and we may have the same problem on 02 as well.

476
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:21.400
Anders Elowsson: Okay, maybe I can explain about Fast Finality very briefly.

477
01:03:21.650 --> 01:03:25.070
Anders Elowsson: Oh, I'm sorry, did I… did I interrupt you?

478
01:03:25.530 --> 01:03:32.930
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): No, no, it's fair, if you can elaborate on that, it will be definitely helpful.

479
01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:45.659
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Well, I don't wanna… I would just wanna double-check if the DEMA idea actually fits the needs of having an improved 02 while being compatible with Fast Finality.

480
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:55.370
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, yeah, no, no, I mean, I totally sympathize with the idea of improving… improving the compounding validator.

481
01:03:55.390 --> 01:04:01.599
Anders Elowsson: I just don't think that it will be enough. So that's… that's why… why I…

482
01:04:01.610 --> 01:04:16.310
Anders Elowsson: I proposed A to C2, because I… I do not think it would be enough, because I know that certain staking service providers, they are locked in… in the… in the sweep… sweep validator, and… and they… they don't want to…

483
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:28.849
Anders Elowsson: And they would… this is just going to be a lot of work to change, and they would prefer to do it. And so then we have options for… okay, and so the reason we want to have a consolidated valid data set is because

484
01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:34.540
Anders Elowsson: in this fast finality design, that the consensus team is working on.

485
01:04:35.100 --> 01:04:57.389
Anders Elowsson: all validators are going to cast their votes on finality within a set time frame, such that we can achieve a faster finality. Right now, we need to go to 32 slots plus 32 slots to reach finality. So that's the reason why we want to consolidate, because then we can use fewer votes.

486
01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:14.129
Anders Elowsson: that's sort of the main… main reason, but… but this design is sort of in flux right now. It's not certain exactly what it will look like, but… but the general… general… generally, just fewer validators will help us achieve.

487
01:05:14.130 --> 01:05:18.089
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): It means that it requires a lower cup.

488
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.829
Anders Elowsson: On the, on the… on the…

489
01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:29.310
stokes: Just a lower number, like, there doesn't have to be a cap, but the smaller the set, the better for finality designs.

490
01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:37.670
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, but if 02 now has a kind of a limit in which it starts withdrawal, withdrawing,

491
01:05:37.850 --> 01:05:44.660
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Let's say, -oh, more than… 266. It means that

492
01:05:46.090 --> 01:05:51.430
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, we are still in this range where we might not have enough

493
01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:58.400
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Enough consolidation, because 266 actually represents just 4 validators.

494
01:05:58.640 --> 01:06:00.710
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Not more, so…

495
01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.560
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, yeah, that's true.

496
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:21.769
Anders Elowsson: That's true, but we will have to sort of… the idea is that we observe that there are only, like, 5,500 nodes on the network, and we want to, therefore, the ideal would be to have, like, 5,500 validators, that's it.

497
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:34.530
Anders Elowsson: And we want to go as close as possible, and then those that only stake 128 ETH, yeah, of course, they will have to then stake 128 ETH and nothing more anyway, so that's perfectly fine.

498
01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:41.819
stokes: Okay, let's jump back to the scoping discussion, but yeah, hopefully that was helpful.

499
01:06:42.310 --> 01:06:59.489
stokes: So, while this was going on, I was also looking at the client opinions from last week, or the last call, and it seemed like most client teams were neutral to against, and yeah, I think also given the arguments today, it's kind of in the same… or in the same spot.

500
01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:04.380
stokes: So, I would propose we… DFI 8062.

501
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:19.489
stokes: But all that being said, as you've seen from the discussion, yeah, there's definitely more to do here, around making 0.2 better, and we can always keep 8062 or something like it for a future fork, and yeah, move forward there if we need.

502
01:07:19.810 --> 01:07:22.100
stokes: Pressure to go to 02.

503
01:07:23.010 --> 01:07:27.510
stokes: So, anyone disagree with, DFI?

504
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:30.920
stokes: Of 8062.

505
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:34.089
stokes: For your Amsterdam.

506
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:42.789
Anders Elowsson: Well, I disagree with it, but I don't, if everyone else agrees, then I don't wanna…

507
01:07:42.790 --> 01:07:43.979
stokes: Yeah, this seems to be…

508
01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.479
Anders Elowsson: They're of concern.

509
01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:47.099
stokes: So, I think we move ahead with DFI.

510
01:07:47.810 --> 01:08:02.029
Dima Gusakov | Lido: The final point to add here, is that, Anders, I agree with you that we do need to have, again, as many consolidations as possible. The problem with, with the current EIP is that

511
01:08:02.030 --> 01:08:21.440
Dima Gusakov | Lido: in the same way as we are currently discussing in the chat, that custom ceilings, and as you said, might not result in a sufficient consolidation, what you're proposing would also likely not result on its own in a sufficient consolidation. So I believe we just need to add, like.

512
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:29.030
Dima Gusakov | Lido: a few more blocks there to increase our chances to maximum. I'm just not super comfortable with saying that

513
01:08:29.170 --> 01:08:43.829
Dima Gusakov | Lido: we will start with penalties before improving UX. So I would rather go with a path where we improve UX, and then, should we see not enough consolidations, we can confidently say, okay, we did our best to improve user experience here.

514
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:48.140
Dima Gusakov | Lido: And, then, guys, okay, now it's time to impose a penalty.

515
01:08:49.290 --> 01:09:04.799
Anders Elowsson: Can I just say that, okay, I mean, yeah, I just want to say that I'm fairly certain that even if we set this variable threshold, it's not going to be enough, and that we need some sort of way to move people over and to consolidate, so…

516
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:16.039
Anders Elowsson: I don't agree with the framing that, oh, let's try this and then see what happens, because I'm just… this is just my personal conviction that I don't think it's gonna be enough.

517
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:20.819
Anders Elowsson: But yeah, if everyone disagrees, then of course, I'm not gonna… Object.

518
01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:30.809
stokes: Okay, so yeah, let's move ahead then with the DFI of AD62 for Glemsterdam.

519
01:09:30.939 --> 01:09:36.479
stokes: And, yeah, from here, again, there's… Different designs to pursue.

520
01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:50.319
stokes: you know, I'll just throw out here, we have a breakout room as an instrument, so, you know, maybe that's one path forward, is a breakout room for this, and then from there, you know, we have some time to work on a different design for a future fork.

521
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:53.590
stokes: Okay.

522
01:09:54.360 --> 01:10:00.209
stokes: So, let me see the list here. We touched on all of these…

523
01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:08.789
stokes: Okay, so then we just have 2 more to get through today, it looks like. So, yeah, let's do 8045, because I think it'll be pretty straightforward.

524
01:10:08.930 --> 01:10:16.049
stokes: 8045 is this EIP that excludes slash validators from proposing. Pretty straightforward, it's in the name.

525
01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:25.330
stokes: Right now, they're not excluded, and especially in situations where there are mass slashings, this leads to, essentially, yeah, let's say degraded performance.

526
01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:27.700
stokes: Because there are just many fewer blocks.

527
01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.149
stokes: And that's not great.

528
01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:45.079
stokes: So, again, going over the client opinions, it looks like there's generally sentiment to move forward with this. It is a pretty small change, and yeah, my only hesitation would just be adding many small changes.

529
01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:50.239
stokes: But, yeah, would anyone like to speak for or against the CIP?

530
01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:53.030
stokes: Notice.

531
01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:56.340
Potuz: Yes, as I mentioned last time,

532
01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:09.980
Potuz: my grudge with this CIP is the fact that today, I mean, to know who's proposing or not, we can use many states within the epoch, not necessarily a checkpoint state.

533
01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.489
Potuz: And these are the kind of things that we cache.

534
01:11:12.990 --> 01:11:29.840
Potuz: Now, the reason is because we only care about being active or about the effective balance. Being slashed is something that happens within an epoch, and this forces us to use a state that has to be the right state to check for proposals.

535
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:49.489
Potuz: This is a change that I'm not completely comfortable with because of this reason, that this forces us to use a state that might not be the state that changed pre… within an epoch. On the other hand, after Fulu, with a look ahead, it sounds that it's safe.

536
01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:52.610
Potuz: But it's… I haven't really vetted it yet.

537
01:11:56.570 --> 01:12:02.379
stokes: It does seem like Proposal Look Ahead, yeah, would get around this, because you can just always check that in the state.

538
01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:07.669
Potuz: Yes, that's if you actually have the state for the right branch.

539
01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:20.719
Potuz: So you need to have at least a state that has the right look ahead. But yeah, so I suspect that it does fix it, but I don't think it's trivial as to say, yeah, this is a very simple change, and that's it.

540
01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:21.310
stokes: Yeah.

541
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:24.809
Potuz: It might bite us as the attestation index did.

542
01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:29.150
stokes: Sure. Barnabas?

543
01:12:30.530 --> 01:12:41.310
Barnabas: Yeah, so I think this would be very good, to be able to recover from an unhealthy network, and this is actually… this was pretty critical in Holsky,

544
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:44.749
Barnabas: So, I would like to see this change in,

545
01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.470
Barnabas: And with the proposal look ahead.

546
01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:59.540
Barnabas: I just don't see the probability of having a validator that gets lashed on the same epoch where, it's gonna be proposing, like, that's not such a big deal.

547
01:12:59.810 --> 01:13:07.620
Barnabas: What the big deal is, is if we have a huge amount of validators that get slashed, that we're gonna be just missing blocks all the time.

548
01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:16.699
Barnabas: So, like, even if… even if you have a validator that is going to be included in the next epoch that gets slashed in the current epoch.

549
01:13:16.830 --> 01:13:23.070
Barnabas: Then, like, yeah, we're gonna be missing one block, but the chance of having that is very, very small.

550
01:13:23.610 --> 01:13:37.850
Potuz: But it's not about that, Barnabas. The issue is not that I am afraid of, like, hitting a proposer that actually just got slashed. The problem is that if anyone gets slashed, and I'm using a state that counted that validator as

551
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:46.210
Potuz: active or not, I might get a different shuffling, and I might get a different set of proposals, regardless of whether or not this guy was included or not.

552
01:13:46.270 --> 01:14:02.899
Potuz: That's the whole point. I need to be careful as to what is the state that I cache to check what the proposals are. If there's only one line, one branch, and we're not for it, the proposal look-ahead immediately gives me this. If I am Fort, I'm not really sure. I…

553
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.800
Potuz: Would need to vet that.

554
01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:11.710
stokes: Okay.

555
01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.229
stokes: So, pending this concern, which I agree we should look into.

556
01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:21.509
stokes: would people, like, do people generally lean towards including this in Amsterdam?

557
01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:30.650
stokes: Because one thing we could do is CFI it today, and basically just, yeah, have this, like, pending…

558
01:14:30.930 --> 01:14:31.950
stokes: to do.

559
01:14:32.070 --> 01:14:33.489
stokes: To verify this thing.

560
01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:40.049
stokes: And if it turns out that there's an issue, like POTUS is saying, then we would just take it out.

561
01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.270
stokes: Or we could change the IP, so there are options.

562
01:14:52.290 --> 01:15:03.039
Potuz: I think we can… we can, like, SFI it if we agree that some people are going to get together and vet that the proposal look-ahead works.

563
01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.610
Potuz: Even if you're, like, syncing from a branch that you haven't, that you don't have.

564
01:15:07.950 --> 01:15:19.539
Potuz: Like, if you manage to sync enough states from that branch until you hit the proposal look ahead, you can use any state that contains that slot. So I think this is true, it just needs to be vetted.

565
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:20.580
stokes: Yeah.

566
01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:32.039
stokes: So, yeah, I mean, that's what I'd say, is we go ahead and put this into the CFI set, and again, this, you know, correlates with how we usually take it, you know, process these things.

567
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:39.969
stokes: If there's a security issue, which this would be a security issue, then, you know, obviously we would adjust or just even take it out, so…

568
01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:47.939
stokes: I think in terms of moving forward, we go ahead and CFI, and yeah, do exactly what Putin said.

569
01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:54.609
stokes: Some people… well… look into this more deeply, and yeah, I will…

570
01:15:54.740 --> 01:15:59.940
stokes: at least do what coordination I can to make sure that someone's actually on it, and that we don't drop this.

571
01:16:01.870 --> 01:16:03.490
stokes: So… okay.

572
01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:05.389
stokes: Are we good there?

573
01:16:10.640 --> 01:16:11.420
stokes: Okay.

574
01:16:11.620 --> 01:16:13.749
stokes: I'm curious what other client teams think.

575
01:16:14.540 --> 01:16:16.719
stokes: Because everyone else has been pretty quiet on the issue.

576
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:25.560
stokes: all I'd really see then is just, the opinions from last call, but again, they were pretty positive, so… okay, we got a lot of plus ones.

577
01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.979
stokes: Okay, so yeah, then CFI… Let me get the number right… 8045.

578
01:16:33.650 --> 01:16:34.570
stokes: Okay.

579
01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:41.689
stokes: Then, we just have one more here, and yeah, then we will have made actually a lot of progress today, which is great.

580
01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:54.390
stokes: So, the last EIP to discuss for today would be 7688, and this, is forward-compatible continuous data structures. This adds stable container into the SSC spec.

581
01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:57.989
stokes: I actually do have a question.

582
01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.539
stokes: with the CIP.

583
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:09.929
stokes: if it were in, does it also imply that we go ahead and change, say, the beacon state or different data structures in Glenster Dam? Like, would we actually go ahead and also…

584
01:17:10.090 --> 01:17:15.270
stokes: Not only introduce this new concept of stable container, but also go ahead and change data structures.

585
01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:33.459
Dustin: Yeah, so the most basic version of this is that it changes some bounded lists into unbounded lists. So it doesn't necessarily change the overall shape of these data structures, but it removes some

586
01:17:33.770 --> 01:17:41.830
Dustin: in many cases, actually kind of meaningless bounds. If you look at the validator limit, that's just some big number.

587
01:17:42.450 --> 01:17:49.019
Dustin: And it removes those things. But it doesn't restructure them in any other way.

588
01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:59.890
stokes: Okay, but yeah, I guess to be clear, like, this isn't just adding this concept to the spec, this would actually, you know, if we include 7688, it would actually be, you know, touching…

589
01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:04.760
stokes: Like, would it just replace every instance of container in the spec with stable container?

590
01:18:07.650 --> 01:18:13.799
Dustin: It… not every. It's… it's… there's some case-by-case aspect, I believe, but… but it's many.

591
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:22.150
Dustin: I mean, it goes through… the EIP goes through and sort of covers the case-by-case aspect again, and this is not… people can read that, but…

592
01:18:24.190 --> 01:18:29.260
stokes: And… okay, cool. Just to play it back then, in terms of sentiment…

593
01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:37.240
stokes: Yeah, I think client teams, some of them were for, some against. There's also…

594
01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:40.550
stokes: A lot of community support, that's worth calling out.

595
01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:46.969
stokes: Even on the agenda today, Ocean from OBOL said, you know, they support this.

596
01:18:47.130 --> 01:18:55.650
stokes: There were a number of, comments from the last call from different staking pools and things that also were interested in this.

597
01:18:56.080 --> 01:19:00.570
stokes: Some other people are here on the call, and yeah, they're also interested in this.

598
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:08.929
stokes: So, you know, I think the thing that has always been the question here is, you know, when is the right time to do this?

599
01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:18.560
stokes: It's certainly nice to have, but Ethereum, you know, will survive without it. So we just have to answer the question, like, yeah, is now the right time?

600
01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:21.760
stokes: I'd love to hear from some client teams.

601
01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:26.620
stokes: And also echo here Barnes' comments, you know, how complex is it?

602
01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:40.250
stokes: even putting aside the code complexity, which would touch SSD libraries, you know, I am very curious if clients think they'd want to get audits of the new code, because again, if there's, like, a bug in this, like, the chain forks, and it's quite bad.

603
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:49.230
stokes: So, yeah, even if, again, the, like, spect is small, I think there are considerations around security here we should take into account.

604
01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.469
stokes: So yeah, any client teams want to chime in?

605
01:19:59.260 --> 01:20:07.899
stokes: Kingitas stay here for Lighthouse. They were originally against it, but now they're more open, given the Miva Fossil to Heka.

606
01:20:11.980 --> 01:20:29.000
saulius: Yeah, so for… from Remdina's side, we… we think that this feature is really great and nice to have, and sooner or later, we… we definitely should have it. But at the same time.

607
01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:39.840
saulius: As seems the consensus is still that we need to ship the hard forks as soon as possible, or essentially fast.

608
01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:49.190
saulius: We think that it's, it's a bit too big feature to, to put that into, into Glamsterdam, so…

609
01:20:49.190 --> 01:21:09.189
saulius: I mean, unless there is shift of thinking that, you know, the longer hard forks are actually not that bad, then we would accept, and we would promote this feature. But unless this happens, I think, it's,

610
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:15.819
saulius: It's not, glamstaden is not the place to put this.

611
01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.020
saulius: Future.

612
01:21:21.620 --> 01:21:22.220
stokes: Okay.

613
01:21:22.400 --> 01:21:23.699
stokes: Other pontofts.

614
01:21:35.110 --> 01:21:40.320
stokes: Enrico here. Tegu in the chat says we're okay with 7688.

615
01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:55.549
stokes: I don't know, yeah. People are generally saying it's slow effort, but again, I think the question, that I would have is hear what Perry said, how large is this feature going to be? And, you know, just put it in the context of everything else.

616
01:21:56.630 --> 01:22:00.240
stokes: Yeah, I… I'm not sure myself.

617
01:22:04.090 --> 01:22:06.950
stokes: Like, what I don't want is to get to a world where…

618
01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:12.070
stokes: you know, this is something like that decision change in Petra, like POTUS mentioned earlier, where…

619
01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:18.930
stokes: again, it might look simple, but as we get into it, it's way more effort than we think. And again, it's like, I do think…

620
01:22:19.750 --> 01:22:25.899
stokes: yeah, there's performance implications, as Terrence mentioned in the chat, and then definitely security here.

621
01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:43.999
stokes: Yeah, Barnabas proposes VCFI, and then, yeah, basically we can take it out if it looks like it's too big.

622
01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:52.669
stokes: I would want to do that sooner rather than later, if we do do it. But yeah, it does seem like generally there is support for this.

623
01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:07.450
stokes: And one thing that would be nice is I think Etan is the champion, and he's not here, which is unfortunate, so…

624
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:12.660
stokes: If we CFI, that gives, yeah, I guess, more time.

625
01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:16.970
stokes: For him to come make a stronger case.

626
01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:33.580
stokes: Okay, I guess the other thing is we'll still need one more call to finalize the churn EIPs, so we could just pause on this for now, and…

627
01:23:34.420 --> 01:23:38.250
stokes: I will reach out to Etan and try to make sure he's at the next call.

628
01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.609
stokes: Then we can decide there.

629
01:23:41.410 --> 01:23:50.180
stokes: But I can say, yeah, people lean towards including the cell, but this might also give people some more time to look into the full complexity.

630
01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.149
stokes: So how about we do that? So…

631
01:24:02.530 --> 01:24:05.370
stokes: Again, I think we made a lot of progress on most of the EIPs.

632
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:15.130
stokes: we would still have, I believe it's just some question of 8061 versus 8080 on the next call, and then also, 7688.

633
01:24:20.570 --> 01:24:25.290
stokes: And we'll… we'd be… we would be making final decisions on those EIPs on the next call, so…

634
01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:36.059
stokes: Okay, no one seems to have any issue with that.

635
01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:44.689
stokes: Okay, so let's do that, and then just to summarize, yeah, I think people lean towards including 7688.

636
01:24:45.010 --> 01:24:48.709
stokes: And from there, we can move ahead with the fork.

637
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.910
stokes: Okay.

638
01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:58.100
stokes: Barnabas had a question here… oh yeah, SSC and the engine API, yeah.

639
01:24:59.330 --> 01:25:01.910
stokes: Do you want to say something, Barnabas?

640
01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.520
stokes: We have a few minutes.

641
01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:21.720
Barnabas: Sure, so the idea would be that, we should probably drop JSON, just because the number of blobs we're planning to put out in the next, year, and ideally, we should probably have the engine API to support FLZ, and make, all the calls,

642
01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:23.790
Barnabas: In… in binary, basically.

643
01:25:27.570 --> 01:25:28.360
stokes: Yeah.

644
01:25:28.950 --> 01:25:31.249
stokes: I agree that's something we should do at some point.

645
01:25:32.550 --> 01:25:42.549
stokes: Okay, there's a few other things, I think, to call out from the agenda, but then let me play back the Glamster name decisions, just so they're all clear.

646
01:25:42.920 --> 01:25:52.769
stokes: So, with Fossil, We will SFI for Hecca Bogota, and DFI for Glamsterdam.

647
01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:58.920
stokes: 47688, gonna make a call on the next ACDC.

648
01:25:59.130 --> 01:26:05.860
stokes: And the ask there would be to get a better sense of the total complexity and what's really involved.

649
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:11.619
stokes: 8045, we said we would go ahead and CFI today.

650
01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:20.809
stokes: Although there is this caveat that if it turns out that there's some issue with how this feature works across forks and complicating client implementations, we would pull it out.

651
01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:37.200
stokes: 8061 and 8080. Again, we're going to look a bit more into the observativity and figure out exactly what's the best thing to do there. We'd answer this question on the next call, and essentially do one or the other.

652
01:26:37.330 --> 01:26:41.150
stokes: Or find some resolution between those two.

653
01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:46.549
stokes: 8062, we decided to do DFI for Amsterdam.

654
01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:49.940
stokes: And 8071, we decided to DFI.

655
01:26:51.220 --> 01:26:56.270
stokes: So, I believe what I said was correct. I ally client.

656
01:26:58.070 --> 01:27:11.980
lightclient: We didn't really get the decision to SFI fossil for HECA. Like, we were kind of discussing different things, and it didn't seem there was a decision to do the SFI, it seems like.

657
01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:15.709
lightclient: That wasn't what was agreed upon?

658
01:27:18.310 --> 01:27:20.579
stokes: Mmm, I think it was.

659
01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.370
stokes: We said DFI for…

660
01:27:23.370 --> 01:27:24.920
lightclient: Pull all the client teams.

661
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:34.690
stokes: Yeah, well, just on this call. So, you know, this is what I believe I said earlier in the call, and there were a bunch of thumbs up at the time.

662
01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:44.199
lightclient: But, I mean, we can't just, like, decide things based on some chat emojis. Like, we didn't ask individual client teams if they want to SFI it.

663
01:27:44.470 --> 01:27:49.789
lightclient: And I feel like, at minimum, we should ask the client teams verbally if they want to SFI for HECA.

664
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:52.740
stokes: Okay.

665
01:27:53.530 --> 01:27:54.360
stokes: Prism.

666
01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.640
Potuz: We haven't had this discussion, Bottus wants to SFI it for Tekken.

667
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:13.560
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): we were for it in Glamsterdam, so we are.

668
01:28:14.010 --> 01:28:14.780
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): break.

669
01:28:17.550 --> 01:28:19.219
stokes: Sorry, what was that? I just missed it.

670
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:28.240
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We were in favor for considering them in fossil in Amsterdam, so we definitely are.

671
01:28:28.520 --> 01:28:29.400
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): In February.

672
01:28:29.630 --> 01:28:31.859
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Let's see if I aim for HECA.

673
01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:36.929
stokes: Okay, I guess the question is also, though, if you're okay with SFI.

674
01:28:38.790 --> 01:28:41.530
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, yeah, for, for HECA, yes.

675
01:28:42.070 --> 01:28:42.720
stokes: Okay.

676
01:28:43.650 --> 01:28:48.899
stokes: Lodestar? Or yeah, Sean unmuted, so, Lighthouse.

677
01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:54.299
sean: So just for me, like, me personally, we haven't talked about this particularly in the lighthouse, but the…

678
01:28:54.510 --> 01:28:57.240
sean: I feel like it should be CFI, not SFI.

679
01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:02.119
sean: I agree with, like, Klein's point that it kind of dilutes SFI, because, like.

680
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:05.170
sean: Is it, like, are we actually committing that hard to it?

681
01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:12.190
stokes: It seems like we went to today, but… Okay.

682
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:13.210
stokes: Sure.

683
01:29:13.210 --> 01:29:15.199
sean: Yeah, just personally, yeah.

684
01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:25.660
stokes: Yeah, And… okay, nimbus, I think Dustin had a comment in the chat that he's fine with SFI.

685
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.410
stokes: Lodestar says they're okay with SFI…

686
01:29:28.410 --> 01:29:30.710
lightclient: Nimbus said they're fine CFI-ing.

687
01:29:32.710 --> 01:29:38.209
Dustin: Either is fine. No, no, no, either is fine. I responded, yeah.

688
01:29:38.210 --> 01:29:38.590
lightclient: Yep.

689
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:39.160
Dustin: Yep.

690
01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:47.350
stokes: Okay. Grandine, I think that was the last one.

691
01:29:55.270 --> 01:29:59.269
stokes: Solius, are you okay with SFI of fossil and HECA?

692
01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:02.920
saulius: I just wrote on chat.

693
01:30:03.080 --> 01:30:04.230
stokes: Oh, I missed it.

694
01:30:06.250 --> 01:30:11.660
stokes: Well, CFI or SFI? Like, this is the distinction that we need to… Subtle.

695
01:30:23.070 --> 01:30:24.200
stokes: Yeah, Potos.

696
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:39.089
Potuz: Trent just said the right thing. It seems that we're taking input from individuals instead of, like, teams, and to be frank, when Matt raised this point, I… my understanding from the call also was that this was kind of contentious.

697
01:30:39.150 --> 01:30:53.049
Potuz: That there wasn't a decision. And even it's kind of strange to make such a decision within this group, that the whole Yale teams are not, and particularly the teams that are, like, that were pushing for other headliners are not here.

698
01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:01.059
Potuz: Even though it's definitely my personal preference to make sure that Fossil is, it's…

699
01:31:01.230 --> 01:31:04.020
Potuz: Sounds weird, it wasn't my reading of the call?

700
01:31:05.690 --> 01:31:06.360
stokes: Okay.

701
01:31:07.410 --> 01:31:13.060
stokes: Yeah, I thought we all had agreement on this earlier, but…

702
01:31:13.700 --> 01:31:17.640
stokes: Especially if you want EL input, this is something we could take to next week's call.

703
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:27.269
stokes: I think this does kind of… yeah, we walk back a little bit in terms of scoping progress.

704
01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:31.270
stokes: But… Yeah.

705
01:31:32.550 --> 01:31:41.649
stokes: I mean, yeah, not… like Plan suggests here, if everyone's okay with CFI, just make it CFI, but then there's some pushback against that, so…

706
01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:46.799
stokes: Although I think, to be clear, the clients seem to all be okay with CFI.

707
01:31:49.210 --> 01:31:54.190
stokes: modular the points raised around, yeah, individuals versus clients, and then also the EL side of things.

708
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:02.349
stokes: Did you have a hand on, sorry?

709
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:07.220
stokes: Okay, I guess not.

710
01:32:07.220 --> 01:32:21.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, yeah, I just wanted to propose, but it doesn't matter so much, but, like, we could next week on ACDE get a signal, and then maybe make the SFI decision in two weeks, because I feel like, in a way, it's more appropriate to make the final decision on the ACDC side.

711
01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:32.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: But that way, basically, everyone, also maybe anyone from the ACD, from the CL side that's not on the call today, has two more weeks. We can think it over the implications of, kind of, an early SFI decision.

712
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:38.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Get the Yale takes, and then make a decision in two weeks, I personally think that would be most appropriate, but yeah.

713
01:32:40.650 --> 01:32:42.500
stokes: Okay, that works for me then.

714
01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:43.950
stokes: So…

715
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:52.410
stokes: Okay, then Fossil, I think we're on the same page now, that, yeah, we need a little further consideration.

716
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:57.639
stokes: We'll take this to next week's ACD and see what the sentiment is there.

717
01:32:57.950 --> 01:33:04.899
stokes: And then we'll revisit this two weeks from today, and make a final call there, along with the other EIPs that I called out.

718
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.750
stokes: Okay.

719
01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:15.390
stokes: Let's see, we have, like, one minute. There are a few more things…

720
01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:24.409
