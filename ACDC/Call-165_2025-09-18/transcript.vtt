00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:34.810
stokes: Hello, everybody.

2
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.619
stokes: Let's give it one more minute, and we'll kick things off.

3
00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.920
stokes: Okay, Josh, are you helping with the stream today?

4
00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.360
Josh Davis: Yep, you're alive.

5
00:06:51.210 --> 00:07:01.400
stokes: Okay, thank you. Hi, everyone. Welcome to ACDC 165. This is issue 1716 in the PM repo.

6
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:11.169
stokes: And the main topic for today will be Fusaka, with a few other minor notes for Amsterdam, but yeah, let's go ahead and get into it.

7
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.250
stokes: So, to kick us off.

8
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:20.530
stokes: It'd be good to touch on Fusaka, DevNet 3, and DevNet 5, and yeah, kind of where we're at there.

9
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:23.490
stokes: I wonder if, Perry or Barnard,

10
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:29.000
stokes: Barnabas or Perry have any, updates there, or anything they'd like to call out?

11
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.059
Barnabas: Sure. Let's start with DevNet 3. DevNet3 has been,

12
00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:48.729
Barnabas: mostly very stable during this past week. We are over 96% participation now. Teams are still pushing out fixes into their trunk branches, and they get automatically deployed onto this network.

13
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.380
Barnabas: We haven't been doing any kind of…

14
00:07:52.730 --> 00:08:01.469
Barnabas: attacks or any splits in this past week, because we have been mainly focusing on Cosaca.net 5, in this, past week.

15
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.239
Barnabas: 7 at 5?

16
00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.080
Barnabas: Started out with,

17
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:15.699
Barnabas: 1,500 nodes, and we did a fulloo last week's Thursday, then we did a BPO a day after the birds.

18
00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:24.449
Barnabas: the… Went up all the way to 72 max blobs, and we did 48 on the day before.

19
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:27.960
Barnabas: Unfortunately, we had a…

20
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:39.139
Barnabas: bug in the configuration, which led to the full node getting a super node flag, which basically meant that our full nodes were

21
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.089
Barnabas: At 100% bandwidth utilization pretty much all the time.

22
00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.250
Barnabas: Which led to quite some issues.

23
00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:56.890
Barnabas: Yesterday, we fixed this by wiping all the full nodes and re-initializing their databases and their… and this also reset their, CGC value.

24
00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:13.970
Barnabas: And we ran an analysis with, 15 max blobs, 21 max blobs, and then 33 max blobs, one more time. But, because of the time window, it's so short between, that time and ACD,

25
00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:21.529
Barnabas: The numbers are not really, representative of, Of many, many slots.

26
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:30.500
Barnabas: Full nodes are representing 90% of the number of nodes, but only 10% of the validators on DevNet 5.

27
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:43.359
Barnabas: Nevertheless, some from our team did an analysis. Pari just linked it in the chat. Hopefully, most of you had the time to take a look before the call.

28
00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:53.230
Barnabas: And the conclusion of our, analysis was that, max values of 15 and 21,

29
00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:57.740
Barnabas: seem to be reasonable for BPO1 and 2.

30
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:09.210
Barnabas: And next value of 32, might lead to struggles into publishing blobs without any V-release or full nodes, with limited bandwidth.

31
00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:26.759
Barnabas: We certainly will have to do another analysis. It's probably going to be physical.net 6, maybe a couple of weeks from now, but, we feel like we should be good to go with Holosky and with these, BPO numbers.

32
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:37.940
stokes: Okay. Yeah, thanks for the update. Yeah, this analysis, looks pretty good. I'm just looking at it now, but…

33
00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:47.709
stokes: everyone definitely take a look there, and… yeah, at least I think that will then confirm, these first two EPOs, which I think was the main thing we wanted.

34
00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.350
stokes: So… yeah.

35
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:57.909
stokes: Any other known bugs, with any of the clients, or any issues we should touch on with the DevNets?

36
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:06.249
Barnabas: Yes, Prism has a known bug that they are investigating right now, that leads to a bunch of, often, blocks.

37
00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:14.030
Barnabas: We are rolling out a fix, or a potential fix right now. I'm not sure if they have anything more to share.

38
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:27.879
Manu: Yeah, I can share something. So yes, we have a bug in prison with a lot of orphan blocks. It seems to be only the case with high blood count and locally

39
00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:33.700
Manu: build block, so there is no issue if it is… if there is MEV, or no issue with low block count.

40
00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:41.120
Manu: We are still in the process of narrowing down the root cause. What just we know right now is

41
00:11:41.190 --> 00:12:00.699
Manu: When we produce the blog, the blog is produced in very well fashion, like a few hundred milliseconds after the start of the slot. And what we see at the end is when we broadcast, the columns, the tech columns are broadcast very late, into the slot, like 6 or 7 seconds.

42
00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:09.520
Manu: So there is something fishy between… after the end of the blog bidding and before the start of the data collection broadcasting.

43
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:16.250
Manu: And yes, we are in the process of finding the root cause in this process.

44
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.089
Manu: That's all I have to say.

45
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:33.239
stokes: It seems like this is a regression. Does that track with your understanding? Or do you think something… do you think something new was introduced that caused this, or is this a regression from what we had in the past?

46
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:41.979
Manu: Actually, possibly, it's not a regression possibility, it's an issue which is here for a long time. However, if I'm not wrong, we…

47
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:47.140
Manu: the best… We mainly tested,

48
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:58.730
Manu: high blood count with MEV, which does not cause any issue, and I think we really started to see the issue when we… when, you know, MEV was deactivated on the…

49
00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:08.010
Manu: On the… on the DevNet 5, with high blood… high blood count. So, possibly, it's not so… it's maybe something totally unrelated to pureness.

50
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:17.810
Manu: A bug which was here from, you know, a long time, but which was not visible with a low, low blood count.

51
00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.220
Manu: Yep.

52
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:23.620
stokes: Yeah, frozen period?

53
00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:44.410
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so I think this could be, just kind of like a potential lead here, could be the fan-out mechanism. So basically, when you're a builder, you are forced to publish to 128 subnets, simultaneously, which means that you need to have peers in all those subnets that are peering… that you're peering with, that are part of your mesh.

54
00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:56.939
Raúl Kripalani: And this usually requires a little bit of preparation ahead of time to make sure that, you know, given a particular peer count, active peer count, you have sufficient density of peers in each of those subnets.

55
00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:04.560
Raúl Kripalani: I am aware, I think we've been looking into the Prism codebase as well, and the peer-to-peer networking team, and we did find out some events in which

56
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:16.440
Raúl Kripalani: Prism can, like, spend 5 to 6 seconds or something like that, discovering peers when it doesn't have sufficient peers, and if this is part of the critical path, that could justify the delay that you're seeing here.

57
00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:26.340
Raúl Kripalani: And this goes, like, in general, as an advice, I think, to all CL clients, is ensuring that, you're correctly

58
00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:43.330
Raúl Kripalani: Predicting when you're gonna be up for builder duty, for proposal duty, and if you're gonna… if you're a local builder, then ensuring ahead of time that you have sufficient peers in your meshes, so that when the time comes, you don't spend any time actually conducting the discovery during the critical path.

59
00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:48.839
Manu: Yeah. So, so for information in a presumably, as soon as

60
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:59.500
Manu: We… we have one active validator. We ensure to have, at least 6 peers, in our fanhood for our data collection subnets.

61
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.189
Manu: So we don't compute, nor are we going to…

62
00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:10.610
Manu: Are we going to propose a block in one way? Just, yes, if we know we have validators, we always make sure that we have peers in all the technical subnets.

63
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:14.610
Manu: Paramount.

64
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.129
Manu: Yeah.

65
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.760
Manu: So normally, I mean, we don't have to search for a new peer when proposing a block.

66
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.810
Manu: And if we do, we have luck for that, and it doesn't seem to be the case. But, yeah, I will double-checked, for sure.

67
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:50.859
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, one of the things I wanted to mention was, in the past, we would either have MEV completely running throughout the lifespan of the network, or we would have it turned off. We didn't really have a fine-grained mechanism to change this, mid-BPO, for example.

68
00:15:50.860 --> 00:16:14.040
Parithosh Jayanthi: But now we've added a scripting approach, so if a BPO lasts for one day, then 12 hours of the day is gonna be with MEV and 12 hours without MEV. So just in case any client dev is looking at a DevNet and wondering why there are no MEV proposals, it's probably because we've disabled it, so that we can test both local block building as well as MEV workflows for all blob numbers.

69
00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:26.910
Manu: And, yeah, and additionally, and from additional information, currently, I know that I checked one hour ago, DevNet3 had LED on.

70
00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:32.130
Manu: And DevNetri has no issue about offhand blocks for poison.

71
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:37.340
Manu: And, yeah, the next 5 had MED off, and there was a lot of orphan issue.

72
00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:53.529
Barnabas: DevNet3 has a significantly more share of super nodes, though, and also much less blobs. They have a next blob count of 20 at most, and I think 50% of the network is super nodes.

73
00:16:53.950 --> 00:17:03.720
Barnabas: I'm… on DevNet5, it's also possible that some of your peers will be only peering with other non-super nodes.

74
00:17:04.270 --> 00:17:11.689
Barnabas: So, peering will be significantly more difficult to… to find enough peers on…

75
00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.649
Barnabas: enough columns. That has all the columns that you need, basically.

76
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.479
Manu: Okay, I will double-check that.

77
00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.599
Manu: Should not be the issue, but yes, worth to check again.

78
00:17:22.609 --> 00:17:31.379
Barnabas: We might need to increase the default peer count on some of the CLs, but I think Lighthouse also increased from 100 to 200.

79
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:36.630
Manu: Yeah.

80
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:44.090
stokes: Okay.

81
00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.100
stokes: Anything else on the DevNets?

82
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.290
stokes: Okay.

83
00:17:54.690 --> 00:18:06.249
stokes: If not, then, next on the agenda, so there was an issue that came up with CKZG. Justin had a note here in the chat, I don't know if you want to add anything to that, Justin, otherwise I can,

84
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:08.050
stokes: Give a summary.

85
00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:10.639
Justin Traglia: Nothing really to add, just that…

86
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:21.340
Justin Traglia: there was a misunderstanding of how, Blast used points at infinity, or… yeah. Pretty much we fixed it with a new release, shouldn't be an issue anymore.

87
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:27.180
stokes: New release of CKTG.

88
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:32.069
Justin Traglia: That's correct. Version 2.1.3.

89
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.770
stokes: Okay, gotcha.

90
00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:39.649
stokes: And… The understanding is that everyone should be using 2 and 3.

91
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.359
stokes: Or at least not using 2-12.

92
00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:43.680
Justin Traglia: Correct.

93
00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:45.650
stokes: Okay.

94
00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:58.200
stokes: I don't remember if there's a way to link this in the specs, but there either should be, or… yeah, I think we should make this clear somehow.

95
00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:02.369
stokes: How have people handled this in the past?

96
00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:05.359
stokes: What was that, Felix?

97
00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.370
Felix (Geth): Sorry, I don't think it's necessary to, like, link specific library versions in the spec.

98
00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.799
stokes: Fair. So then we should just remove 212 from the repo?

99
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:24.550
Justin Traglia: You mean, like… or what do you mean, exactly?

100
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:28.490
stokes: Well, it sounds like 2 and 2 is just broken, right?

101
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.780
Justin Traglia: Yeah, sure. You wanted me to, like… Okay.

102
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.980
Justin Traglia: Remove it as a release from TKZG?

103
00:19:35.410 --> 00:19:42.289
stokes: Yeah, I mean, I want to prevent what happened, where I think some clients upgraded to it, because there was a new release, and then it caused some issues.

104
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:50.110
Justin Traglia: Yeah, I mean, we can discuss it. Personally, I don't think that's necessary, but .

105
00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:51.470
stokes: Right.

106
00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.409
stokes: I'll follow up with you later, then.

107
00:19:55.060 --> 00:20:01.270
stokes: Then… I guess that's everything there. Just be aware of that.

108
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:05.490
stokes: Okay.

109
00:20:05.970 --> 00:20:13.620
stokes: Let's see here, let me look at the agenda. Okay, so, yeah, if that's everything we need to talk about in the DevNuts,

110
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:17.180
stokes: The next thing I wanted to bring up was the testnet schedule.

111
00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.059
stokes: So, I have a proposal here.

112
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:23.520
stokes: And… let me just run through it, and then we can discuss.

113
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:32.040
stokes: So… The proposal would be next Monday, which is the 22nd of September, effectively code freeze.

114
00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:42.919
stokes: This could be, like, a branch or some commit on, say, you know, a trunk branch, but ultimately, you know, this would be the code that would go into releases for testnets.

115
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:49.119
stokes: If we have code freeze then, I believe the PandaOps team is willing to do some validation on this code.

116
00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:51.870
stokes: Just to make sure things, you know.

117
00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:58.109
stokes: look okay, and yeah, maybe once I'm done talking, they'll have something to add here. On that point.

118
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.050
stokes: But essentially, aim for Code Freeze next Monday.

119
00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:11.549
stokes: Then if we aim for testnet releases for all 3 testnets on the 25th, which I believe is next Thursday… let me just double check that…

120
00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:13.260
stokes: It is…

121
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:21.369
stokes: Then from there, we would aim, following sort of the process stuck that we had, at something like 2 weeks,

122
00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.780
stokes: For every testnet from there.

123
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:38.619
stokes: So then, Heleshky would be on 2nd of October, Sepoli on 16th of October, Hudi on 30th of October, and there are fork epochs that align with all the different parameters we need, here on the repo.

124
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:50.820
stokes: And… I guess one thing to note is the Sepolia fork that would work on the 16th of October is during ACD, so I'm not sure if we want to move that.

125
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.619
stokes: Even assuming we can, you know, agree to the schedule here.

126
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:56.949
stokes: But that was something to flag.

127
00:21:57.190 --> 00:22:09.289
stokes: And, yeah, one other note, we would use the BPO schedule from .NEF5. Again, it sounds like from the analysis we had, we can at least validate these first two BPOs with the numbers that were given.

128
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:16.030
stokes: From there, I think everyone knows the deal. You know, if there's a test network and it doesn't go well.

129
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:28.089
stokes: This is basically, you know, everything after that's on pause. If everything does go well, then even when we get to the last testnet with Hoodie, mainnet would be, you know, 30 days after that, so…

130
00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:38.829
stokes: That's a proposal, it keeps things moving, and yeah, also generally follows this process document that we've been discussing over the last few ACDs.

131
00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:45.549
stokes: So… I see… yeah, Christine here put this in the chat, thank you for that.

132
00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:52.379
stokes: And, okay, yeah, Barnabas, do you want to discuss your adjustments?

133
00:22:53.150 --> 00:23:08.499
Barnabas: Right, so my adjustments would be that we don't do a fork on a non-Wednesday, basically. Okay. Wednesdays are probably the best, most suitable days for a fork, because it allows us to debug before and afterwards as well.

134
00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:16.389
Barnabas: And it doesn't clash with ACD as well. My proposal would be we would do Holsky.

135
00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.800
Barnabas: Fusaka on the 1st of October.

136
00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:28.519
Barnabas: Then, a week after that, we do the first BPO, then a week after that, we do the second BPO. Then, a day after that, we do Sepoya Fusaka.

137
00:23:28.730 --> 00:23:44.439
Barnabas: And, we basically just keep repeating this pattern, throughout all the different testnets. So we wait one week for each BPOs, and, we're gonna ship all the BPOs before we proceed for the next testnet,

138
00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:45.470
Barnabas: book.

139
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:55.369
Barnabas: So this allows us to run analysis on the different testnets, just to make sure that everything is still looking good before we, pull the trigger.

140
00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.730
stokes: Yeah.

141
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:10.370
stokes: Okay, I mean, yeah, I'll validate the numbers you have here, but… That seems reasonable.

142
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.999
stokes: I think, most importantly, I would like to hear from the clients what they think.

143
00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:28.520
stokes: I reached out to a number of different, I think I reached out to every client team over the last couple days, and I think generally they're okay with this. I think the main thing to figure out for now is just really next week, in terms of code freeze and releases.

144
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:32.160
stokes: But yeah, I'd love to hear, if anyone

145
00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.040
stokes: Has an issue with this, or thinks we should make adjustments somewhere.

146
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:58.240
stokes: So, I've gotten thumbs up from all the client teams before, so if no one says anything, I will just assume it's still thumbs up.

147
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:07.249
stokes: Okay, now there's a lot of thumbs up on the Zoom screen.

148
00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:11.470
stokes: So… Okay, that's very exciting.

149
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.250
stokes: Does anyone…

150
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:22.779
stokes: I guess one question here is… yeah, like, do we just go with Barnab as a schedule?

151
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:29.669
stokes: I'd have to look and see… But it seems good.

152
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.700
Barnabas: All the epochs are on the boundaries.

153
00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.470
Barnabas: So…

154
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.250
stokes: Okay, yeah, that's mine.

155
00:25:37.250 --> 00:25:42.960
Barnabas: The official room fight, also, I made sure that the BPOs are on the boundaries as well.

156
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.590
stokes: Okay.

157
00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:53.330
stokes: Yeah, I guess what we could do, because this might take a little double-checking async, is just also have this finalized by…

158
00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.620
stokes: Monday, along with Code Freeze.

159
00:25:56.070 --> 00:26:03.540
stokes: And… I would say lean towards go with this, unless someone wants to say otherwise.

160
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:05.490
stokes: But yeah, I just…

161
00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:17.440
Parithosh Jayanthi: The next step needs to be a PR to the ETH clients repository, updating and setting the forks, and then we can make sure that all the clients have, looked at that before we merge it in.

162
00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:19.450
stokes: Yeah.

163
00:26:20.690 --> 00:26:22.379
stokes: Okay, yeah.

164
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:24.659
stokes: Oh, Barnabas says you can do that. Great.

165
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:29.810
Barnabas: So, cool, yeah. One more thing that,

166
00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:41.769
Barnabas: I suggested that we're gonna have different release deadlines, instead of trying to get everyone to include all the timelines in the release. I'm not sure if they want to.

167
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:44.080
Barnabas: But, like, we could have a…

168
00:26:44.830 --> 00:26:54.300
Barnabas: you could basically have all three raised deadline by the 24th, then Sepolia raised deadline a week after that, and two weeks after that, the Holy One.

169
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.889
Barnabas: I'm not sure if it's really needed.

170
00:26:57.110 --> 00:27:02.610
Barnabas: Or whether we just want to pre-schedule everything in one release.

171
00:27:04.410 --> 00:27:11.960
stokes: Yeah, I think it's simpler for everyone if there's just one release, but… Yeah, I guess so.

172
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:14.910
stokes: I'd love to hear from clients how they feel.

173
00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.430
stokes: Is that helpful for anyone?

174
00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:32.379
Ameziane Hamlat: So, for Basic side, it would be helpful, because we are working on some performance improvements that we would like to include for Fuseka.

175
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:40.009
Ameziane Hamlat: So we may need to have a different release between the one for Holesky and…

176
00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.899
Ameziane Hamlat: Let's say the one for a hotel, for example.

177
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:55.760
Łukasz Rozmej: So, I think, like, we can definitely do one for all, but we might,

178
00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.109
Łukasz Rozmej: Also, like, do some service releases after that,

179
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:06.320
Łukasz Rozmej: But I think that's fine, and that should also be fine for Bess, so I don't really see this being a conflict.

180
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:19.720
Łukasz Rozmej: I think if we can agree that it's probably fine to have a release that supports… as a baseline that supports all testnets, but then have subsequent releases after that. That shouldn't be a problem.

181
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.359
stokes: Okay, so, well, everyone will aim to have one release, but then, yeah, if things update, then that's all perfectly fine.

182
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.880
stokes: Okay.

183
00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:38.779
stokes: Cool. Does everyone feel good about this?

184
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:48.529
Matthew Keil: Yeah, I can second that sentiment, that, we're ready for a release, and, but the flexibility in case something comes up during test sets.

185
00:28:49.490 --> 00:28:52.109
Matthew Keil: To be able to put one more out before mainnet.

186
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:58.809
stokes: Yeah, I mean, you can always, I think, Cut a release.

187
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.940
stokes: But just for the test nights, given there's so many, sometimes it's simpler just to aim for one, but…

188
00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:12.480
stokes: Yeah, definitely, we should be able to accommodate, At least 3.

189
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:14.310
Dustin: I mean…

190
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:33.719
Dustin: Practically, this means that there's… unless there's a… things go catastrophically wrong, there will not be a schedule delay. That's not necessarily good or not necessarily bad, but… but once those releases are out there, and now…

191
00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:49.889
Dustin: Essentially, the dynamic that happens is it becomes partly as risky to delay the release, even if you think it might go wrong, than it is to… the fork schedule, than it is to keep it going and just make it a…

192
00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:59.890
Dustin: an emergency fix, if all of the releases are scheduled at the same time, and this has happened before. So, I mean, as long as people go into that knowingly, that's…

193
00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:02.849
Dustin: Fine. I don't know. It's a choice.

194
00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.429
Dustin: But…

195
00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:11.330
Dustin: And this is… but this is one reason why I know the… in other discussions, this has been…

196
00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.529
Dustin: Yeah, a trade-off discussed.

197
00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:25.390
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I would say it's fine. I think,

198
00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:30.690
Marius van der Wijden: Because these testnets are only run by a very small

199
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:44.779
Marius van der Wijden: group of people, we can always ask them to just use the newest release. Yeah, and the important thing is that we don't bake in the mainnet release into the tested release, so that the mainnet release will be

200
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.740
Marius van der Wijden: must be a different release. And I think that's… that's it.

201
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.630
stokes: Yeah, sounds good to me.

202
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.380
stokes: Okay.

203
00:31:02.610 --> 00:31:08.100
stokes: Again, I know this has been a huge lift to get here, so, I guess congrats, everyone.

204
00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.549
stokes: And let's hope the test notes go well.

205
00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:19.100
stokes: So… Cool, we'll get this PR up for the schedule…

206
00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.520
Barnabas: Should I make the schedule then based on the timelines that I've suggested?

207
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:30.959
stokes: Yeah, I think so. I'll double check, just to make sure, you know, things are aligned to these boundaries and stuff, but yeah, let's go ahead and go with what you had.

208
00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.230
stokes: It looks good.

209
00:31:36.930 --> 00:31:44.320
stokes: Cool, okay. Anything else on Fusaka? I think this is pretty much…

210
00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.970
stokes: what we have today, on Fusaka, just because, yeah, we're in the process.

211
00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:50.449
stokes: Anything else?

212
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.499
Parithosh Jayanthi: The audit went live, do we wanna maybe mention that?

213
00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.989
stokes: That would be good. Frederick, I don't know if you have something to say there, otherwise…

214
00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.629
stokes: I can go try to find a link to it.

215
00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:10.979
stokes: I don't have one handy.

216
00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:27.169
stokes: Here, I'll just… oh yeah, thanks, Justin. Okay, so yeah, I was looking at this blog post here. So…

217
00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:34.720
stokes: Yeah, you know, every upgrade, we usually do one of these security competitions, we have one live for Fusaka.

218
00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.850
stokes: There's a $2 million bounty here.

219
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:45.979
stokes: And, yeah, check out the post, especially if you are in the security space and listening to this recording, or watching it live.

220
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:53.300
stokes: This is super useful. We've found things in the past that, you know, are direct impacts to mainnet security, so…

221
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:58.419
stokes: This is a super good program, just to find any lost bugs lingering.

222
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:04.140
stokes: And… yeah, I think that's all I have to say. I don't know if anyone wants to add anything else.

223
00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:13.720
stokes: Mario says it projects 20,000 submissions by the end of the contest.

224
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.869
stokes: I don't know where that number's coming from.

225
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.830
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, that… I don't know that…

226
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:19.260
stokes: odds.

227
00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:32.779
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, the algorithm is kind of weird, but there have been some submissions, and the security team is looking at them, but we also want to encourage all the client teams to look at them as often as possible.

228
00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:43.369
Marius van der Wijden: So, yeah, these things don't go stale, and we don't receive, like, duplicate submissions because the code hasn't been updated.

229
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:45.980
stokes: Okay.

230
00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.530
stokes: Cool.

231
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.220
stokes: Anything else on Fusaka?

232
00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:16.290
Barnabas: One more thing, like, it would be very good to get an update on, backfill from different clients, because I think this was one of the main points that we, still have to ship.

233
00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:22.599
Barnabas: I think Lighthouse now has working backfill, but I'm not sure about any other client teams that have,

234
00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.960
Barnabas: finished implementing Backflow.

235
00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:31.770
stokes: Okay, Bota says Prism has it.

236
00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.519
stokes: Yeah, there's an implementation they're working on.

237
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:47.010
Fredrik: I can say something more about the competition quickly. There is, for the client teams, so they're aware,

238
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:50.159
Fredrik: There's a bit of an issue right now with the…

239
00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:54.289
Fredrik: Judging aspect, but that's gonna be fixed.

240
00:34:54.570 --> 00:35:01.070
Fredrik: Tomorrow, most likely, so that's… Brian teams can provide comments, and

241
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:16.700
Fredrik: yeah, feedback on the severity levels, etc. And then, yeah, if you need any more people from your team to have access to the competition, to provide this feedback, then you can just reach out, and we will get everyone added.

242
00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:22.640
stokes: Alright, thanks.

243
00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:32.710
stokes: Yeah, Barnabas, back on the backfilt topic, do you just want to follow up async?

244
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:34.149
Barnabas: Yeah, sure.

245
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.209
stokes: Do you have any other questions right now? Okay.

246
00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:41.230
stokes: Did we want to touch on this earliest available slot thing? Because that also did come up.

247
00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:55.260
Barnabas: I'm happy to bring it up, but I think that can also be discussed.

248
00:35:55.420 --> 00:35:56.610
Barnabas: Oh, awesome.

249
00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.500
stokes: Okay.

250
00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:06.119
stokes: Another comment here in the chat from Solus, Grandine also has backfill, merged very soon.

251
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:08.650
stokes: Cool.

252
00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:19.589
stokes: Then with that… Glamsterdam, and then, yeah, a few announcements from A.B. Kotap.

253
00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.529
stokes: Let's make sure I say that correctly.

254
00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:32.220
stokes: So yeah, with Amsterdam, I think the main thing to keep in mind for now is that we said we want to have non-headliner EIPs proposed.

255
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:39.299
stokes: by Fusaka Midnight Releases, which, with the schedule today, gives you some more clarity on when that would be.

256
00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:50.269
stokes: So that's good. Otherwise, yeah, I don't think we really need to get into it, just because I think we should all stay focused on Fusaka for the time being.

257
00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:54.400
stokes: Yeah, if there's, like, very brief…

258
00:36:55.040 --> 00:37:00.709
stokes: announcements or something anyone would like to provide around breakouts or something, I think that's admissible, but…

259
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:04.659
stokes: Otherwise, I think that's all we really need to say there.

260
00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:13.670
stokes: Then, on the announcements I mentioned, so… we do have an ETH Magicians post here.

261
00:37:14.030 --> 00:37:18.739
stokes: for the name for H-star, Which, yeah, I forget…

262
00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:22.210
stokes: Okay, there was a poll… here, let me grab the link here.

263
00:37:24.850 --> 00:37:30.849
stokes: There was a poll here, and I guess, yeah, we just need to actually make the decision at some point.

264
00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:35.310
stokes: So yeah, take a look there if you want to chime in.

265
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:43.340
stokes: And there's another request here for a name for the replacement testnet for Sepolia.

266
00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:48.869
stokes: I will… Share this, because it was added to the agenda.

267
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:52.350
stokes: I…

268
00:37:52.550 --> 00:38:01.039
stokes: Myself, I'm not convinced we need to replace Apolia, even though I know that was sort of what was written down with, this LTS situation.

269
00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.160
stokes: But I think that might be a conversation for a different day.

270
00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:12.389
stokes: So, in any case… Following the schedule, yeah, we would basically sunset Sepolia,

271
00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:18.460
stokes: Soon-ish, and then there would be some replacement, and this post is just asking for a name for the replacement.

272
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:37.389
Parithosh Jayanthi: I do want to maybe make a point here, we're still helping a lot of people migrate to… from Holsky to Houdi, so we don't want to add to the chaos and immediately have everyone also migrate from Sepolia. So, even though Sepolia is supposed to be end-of-the-year

273
00:38:37.390 --> 00:38:54.980
Parithosh Jayanthi: terminated, I think we will add, like, a decent grace period. We'll probably update wording, and even if there is a replacement test for support here, we'll make sure that both are running at least for a considerable time, so that no one's, overburdened with having to migrate their entire stack.

274
00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.490
Parithosh Jayanthi: Multiple times in a year.

275
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:02.629
stokes: Yeah, that sounds good to me. I mean…

276
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:09.840
stokes: Yeah, again, maybe a topic for a different day, but I am not sure why we need to actually tear down Sepolia at this moment.

277
00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.170
stokes: But yeah, again, different, conversation.

278
00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:23.650
stokes: In any case, yeah, I think what Perry said stands, so there'd be plenty of grace period, just so there's not, yeah, more pressure there.

279
00:39:28.210 --> 00:39:33.740
stokes: Okay, with that, this was everything we had on the agenda today.

280
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.610
stokes: Anything else?

281
00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:49.459
Barnabas: I would like to discuss, Glamsterdam testing, and, possibly splitting up, all DevNet 0 and EPPS DevNet 0, and keeping them

282
00:39:49.880 --> 00:40:00.999
Barnabas: separate as long as we basically can, and we want to. Personal has a 90% done implementation that would support,

283
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:08.500
Barnabas: the block access stuff, and I think, we can just basically do a prism-only,

284
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:16.330
Barnabas: DevNet for all the ELs that would be supporting it, and that way we don't have to burden any of the other CR devs with this.

285
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:19.919
Barnabas: And they can implement it whenever they want.

286
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:28.540
Barnabas: So, at least for the first couple of iterations of, while DevNets, I think we can just have it with Prism.

287
00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:33.599
Barnabas: And then, on the other side…

288
00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:43.739
Barnabas: So that would not trigger any EPPS testing, and then we could have the EPPS testing without the ball testing, basically.

289
00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:55.000
Barnabas: I just want to make sure that all the CR teams are focused on EPBS testing and writing EPBS stuff, and so we can start testing in parallel as soon as possible.

290
00:40:56.110 --> 00:41:02.049
stokes: Yeah, that part makes sense. I was gonna ask, is this okay with the Prism devs? Like, are…

291
00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.539
stokes: Can they produce something that's good for BLs?

292
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.970
Barnabas: It's already done. Like, it's 90% done.

293
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:10.540
stokes: Okay.

294
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.850
stokes: Okay.

295
00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:24.430
stokes: Okay, and yeah, just to be clear, that would have the EPPS features in it, and they would do BLs on top of that with EPPS?

296
00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.610
Barnabas: No, it's without the PPS.

297
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.529
stokes: Okay, interesting.

298
00:41:34.030 --> 00:41:34.860
stokes: Cutters?

299
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:48.220
potuz: Yeah, so the issue is that, block access lists, without EPBS requires a change in the beacon state, and this is the problem, and why we were petitioned on having different branches.

300
00:41:48.310 --> 00:42:03.269
potuz: With DPBS, block access list doesn't require any changes on the beacon state, because we've removed the header, the execution payload header from the state. So now, in the future forks, whenever we change the payload, we do not need to change the beacon state anymore.

301
00:42:12.330 --> 00:42:17.480
stokes: Okay, Francesca's also asking in the chat here, we might not need CL changes?

302
00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:18.170
stokes: For BL.

303
00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:20.850
Francesco: Yeah, it's just what was just said by Purdus.

304
00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:23.240
stokes: Oh, sorry, okay.

305
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.420
stokes: My bad.

306
00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:36.919
Barnabas: Yeah, but the question is, can we… can we check, ER functionality without… like, testing any EPBS functionality.

307
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:48.830
stokes: So what would that look like? It would be a Fusaka release with no PPS on top?

308
00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.649
Barnabas: Yeah, so the PR that I linked is that.

309
00:42:55.200 --> 00:43:01.319
Barnabas: It's basically implement EIP7928 as gloss fork without concentrating.

310
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:12.800
stokes: Okay. Does this work for the AL teams, then? Because then, yeah, they can use this for the CL, and then we can move ahead on VL DevNets.

311
00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:22.030
stokes: Podos, did you raise your hand again?

312
00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:31.930
potuz: Yeah, so I was… I wanted to suggest, I mean, it's absolutely fine to use this branch now, but I would suggest that as soon as we have some minimal implementation of EPBS,

313
00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:47.229
potuz: that we can… if we could, switch to doing this on top of EPBS, because maintaining this branch, even though it's mostly generated code, it's going to be a mess. It's… I mean, it's… it changes everywhere. Whenever you change the beacon state, it changes everywhere.

314
00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:58.839
potuz: So I think it would be better if we switched to doing block access lists on top of EPBS so that we maintain a single… and we actually start merging into our main branches these changes.

315
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:07.870
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, we just need it for now, so that we can unblock stuff. We don't need to maintain this long term. The moment EPBS has minimum viable

316
00:44:07.870 --> 00:44:26.539
Parithosh Jayanthi: client support, we're gonna switch over to that. We just want to ASAP start with block-level access lists, and also just for the other CL teams, you guys don't have to do anything. We just need one CL team to take on the topic, because that will unblock us, and the rest of you can continue work on EPBS, and

317
00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:28.619
Parithosh Jayanthi: Mudge everything later.

318
00:44:38.260 --> 00:44:38.940
stokes: Right.

319
00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.739
stokes: So it sounds like we have a plan, then. We can use this PR here, 15712.

320
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:54.980
stokes: And move ahead with BLs, and then, yeah, I guess another sort of point here is not having this become, like, a persistent branch.

321
00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:59.660
stokes: Plan being to get things merged sooner rather than later.

322
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:03.699
stokes: And… yeah, okay.

323
00:45:04.930 --> 00:45:05.979
stokes: Are we good there?

324
00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.440
stokes: Marvis?

325
00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:22.910
Barnabas: Yeah, I have just one more thing. So, if we can have, client releases, done by maybe next week, Monday or Tuesday or something like that, and we plan to do a shallow fork.

326
00:45:23.290 --> 00:45:28.749
Barnabas: And this shadow fork is going to be for Hudi, one for Sepulia, and one for, Koski.

327
00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:44.189
Barnabas: And then… probably we can also do a mainnet shadow fork, but maybe not next week. So ideally, as soon as the client teams are ready, please let us know, because we would like to have this shadow fork up and running as soon as possible.

328
00:45:48.020 --> 00:45:52.210
stokes: Yeah, there was also a question here from James, about this, so…

329
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:59.250
stokes: I don't think it matters to you, but would you prefer a release, or, you know, is, like, a commit okay?

330
00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.760
stokes: Or is it more up to the team?

331
00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:05.440
Barnabas: I would personally prefer a release, yeah.

332
00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.679
stokes: Okay. That might take a few more days, though. And is that okay?

333
00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.239
Barnabas: When do client teams plan to have OSCI releases, if we plan to roll it out by the 1st of October?

334
00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:26.290
stokes: So, I think, generally, we're aiming for Thursday next week.

335
00:46:27.850 --> 00:46:28.490
Barnabas: Okay.

336
00:46:28.590 --> 00:46:35.340
Barnabas: Yeah, I mean, we can do… we can do that. If we have, releases by next Thursday, we can do host t-shadow work next week, Friday.

337
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:52.040
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, so maybe some, context on that. We already have all of our Shadow Fork, playbooks up and running. I'll run them through a mock version tomorrow, so that when the client releases are done, it should take us a matter of, let's say, hours before we'll have the Shadow Fork update.

338
00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.570
stokes: Okay, so I guess the point is that…

339
00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:13.470
stokes: Pandops will do some validation here with shadow forks and things, as soon as they have, you know, something from your client team,

340
00:47:13.870 --> 00:47:17.940
stokes: Yeah, I think from there, like, if we can hit Monday, that's great.

341
00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:27.470
stokes: the reason to separate, like, code freeze on Monday from, say, a release on Thursday was just as… was just because some of the clients, I think, have a few days to, like, soak the code before they make a release.

342
00:47:28.210 --> 00:47:33.019
stokes: So… Yeah, but then I guess you're also saying it's fine if you don't get that…

343
00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.789
stokes: And implementation until Thursday, right, Barnabas?

344
00:47:39.630 --> 00:47:40.440
Barnabas: Yeah, that's fine.

345
00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:41.809
stokes: Your thumb is still up.

346
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:43.530
stokes: Okay, cool.

347
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:47.070
stokes: Everyone clear on that?

348
00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:48.710
stokes: Any questions?

349
00:47:49.960 --> 00:48:00.110
Dustin: I'm wondering on Guido, I mean, has this been tested at scale? I mean, I say as Nimbus was what Nimbus and Techu were a couple of the clients who discovered this, Nimbus was…

350
00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:13.010
Dustin: exposed to this in the DevNets for a while, and we were performing worse because of this. This was fine-ish on the DevNets, that's what they're for. We don't… but typically, we would not want to do a release with…

351
00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:24.460
Dustin: who knows? I mean, especially if it's BLAST and CKCG at the same time. I would say, except for emergency situations, this is precisely the kind of

352
00:48:25.830 --> 00:48:44.419
Dustin: dependency bumps that I would wait till just after a release like this to do, so we had not just two days, but weeks, or at least a couple of weeks, which is clearly not going to happen in this case, for this to, soak, to use the verb people are using here.

353
00:48:44.910 --> 00:48:48.720
Dustin: So, that… there's some wariness on my end from that, I'll say.

354
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:57.220
stokes: Yeah, because you're concerned with an issue in the newest CK, did you release?

355
00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.380
stokes: Or just simply doesn't that time?

356
00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.140
Dustin: Become Lindy. Yeah.

357
00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:15.590
Dustin: Yeah, that… well, if it were only the CKZ Geo, it actually wouldn't be as bad, because, if it… that only really affects Fusakra to begin with, then that's a lower stakes thing for now. That's test ad only.

358
00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:33.349
Dustin: But we don't do test and only releases if we don't have to, and we won't have to otherwise here. And so this will also be a mainnet release, not the Fusaka fork mainnet release, but the mainnet release. And BLAST is a absolutely critical dependency.

359
00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:41.500
Dustin: we don't update with P2P, like, 3 days before a release either. That's… Stupid high risk.

360
00:49:43.570 --> 00:49:56.400
Dustin: why… I don't know that we would update Blast, and that's why I asked before, and got the answer from, Justin, saying, well, no, like, they go together. And they don't… Blast doesn't have a release out yet.

361
00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.790
Justin Traglia: That's true. This is just hybrid from my end.

362
00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:10.229
Justin Traglia: Would you prefer if we make a new CKG release that adds back the pointed infinity filtering to CKZG, so that you do not have to update BLAST?

363
00:50:11.550 --> 00:50:12.250
Dustin: Yes.

364
00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:13.990
Justin Traglia: Okay.

365
00:50:14.890 --> 00:50:19.710
Justin Traglia: We'll do that. I think that'd make… Everyone felt better, so…

366
00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.320
Justin Traglia: Yeah, consider that done. I'll do it today.

367
00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:24.240
Dustin: Okay, great.

368
00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.030
stokes: Okay.

369
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:39.050
stokes: Anything else?

370
00:50:47.250 --> 00:50:50.710
stokes: Okay, if not, then let's go ahead and wrap up today.

371
00:50:51.550 --> 00:50:53.380
stokes: Good luck with MSACA, everyone.

372
00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.940
stokes: And I will see you next time.

373
00:50:57.440 --> 00:51:01.170
stokes: Oh, this is a fun question from Perry. Did anyone do anything cool to celebrate March Day?

374
00:51:03.050 --> 00:51:05.789
stokes: I imagine we were all working off Osaka. I did.

375
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:10.480
stokes: Yeah.

376
00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:13.650
stokes: Okay, I'll see y'all next time. Thank you.

377
