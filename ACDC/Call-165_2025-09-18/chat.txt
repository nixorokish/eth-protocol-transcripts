00:12:40	Raúl Kripalani:	This could be related to the fanout/discovery mechanism
00:12:43	Justin Traglia:	Worth mentioning that there was a bug in ckzg v2.1.2 due to a misunderstanding of how blst handled points-at-infinity in their pippenger msm function. We’ve fixed this with a v2.1.3 release. Existing spec tests didn’t find this because there was a different code path for higher blob counts. We’ve added a new test for this too.

00:15:24	potuz:	yeah I doubt fannouts peers is the issue here
00:15:44	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops...."

question though, for test 1: I am pretty sure we already knew that local building for low-bw nodes (so 50 Mbit) would have feasibility limits, but that we would be okay with locally set caps on max included blobs.

So that should specifically not be a bottleneck to go to 32 blobs or beyond
00:17:41	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops...."

Yup, I think we had a few other issues that made 32 and beyond hard to quantify. I think we’re missing a few optimisations that clients haven’t had time for.
00:17:59	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops.…"
Yeah this what I meant with “not enough topic density amongst your peers”

00:18:11	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops.…"
Generally CLs should be reserving some quota to peer with supernodes
00:18:36	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops...."

yes totally fair, and I don’t think we need to get there for BPOs 1 & 2.

just wanted to point out that local building specifically should not be considered a bottleneck for 32 or beyond.
00:18:54	Dustin:	hmmm, we'd prefer not to update to a non-release of BLST
00:19:29	felipe:	Should v2.1.2 be yanked?
00:19:31	Barnabas:	Replying to "hmmm, we'd prefer no..."

I think thats in the works
00:19:36	Felix (Geth):	we can all just upgrade

00:19:56	Felix (Geth):	it's a normal procedure
00:20:00	Dustin:	Replying to "hmmm, we'd prefer ..."

ok but until then that's a soft-blocker for updating to 2.1.3

Could all CLs please help us keep this up to date? It would help people conducting audits
00:20:55	J Sunnyside Labs:	Replying to "https://ethpandaops...."

Just to add: we ran LH and Teku fullnodes which capped at 50/25Mbps instead. I think they can perform local block building better with higher caps.
00:20:57	Fredrik:	< 2.1.2 also does not have the security fixes from the audit: https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844/blob/main/audits/2025_zksec.pdf  , so 2.1.3 would be recommended

00:21:10	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "hmmm, we'd prefer no..."

Yeah it’s an annoying situation. We could make another release which just adds back point-at-infinity filtering in ckzg if you all want this.

Where do the 10/15 numbers come from? I think this should be 9/14
00:27:18	Dustin:	tradeoff is if anything goes wrong, then oops
00:27:20	Dustin:	now it's emergency
00:27:25	Barnabas:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

9/14 is not 2/3
00:27:35	Dustin:	with single release
00:27:48	Dustin:	(i.e. if Holesky goes badly, and a pause is needed)
00:27:55	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

I mean not exactly but that’s fine.
00:28:09	Barnabas:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

We want exactly 2/3s
00:28:17	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

Well we can modify the update fraction if needed
00:28:20	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

But yes we should test it
00:28:22	Barnabas:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

Ideally not.
00:28:32	Barnabas:	Replying to "Holesky Release dead..."

Update fraction works nicely with 2/3s ratios
