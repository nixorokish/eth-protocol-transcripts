00:21:55	kingy_sigp:	sorry I tuned out for a second it's 1am in aus -- lighthouse is making good progress. No firm timing yet but we're closing in on being able to interop with lh nodes internally within a few weeks.
00:22:18	Potuz:	similarly for Prysm
00:24:17	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Could we just round robin teams and ask? Can we have a devnet mid feb?

THat’s easier to remove BAL not so much?
00:24:55	kingy_sigp:	I think we could hit devnet 0 in a month at lighthouse but I'm hesitant to commit to that since we're still early

28th of Jan - [bal-devnet-2](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/bal-devnet-2)

18th of Feb - [epbs-devnet-0 ](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/epbs-devnet-0)
4th of Mar - [epbs-devnet-1](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/epbs-devnet-1)
18th of Mar - epbs-devnet-2 TBD
1st of Apr - glamsterdam-devnet-0 - rebase everything over everything 
15th of Apr - glamsterdam-devnet-1 - every EIP added

That was like 2 months ago, not so early on
00:30:42	Potuz:	Replying to "Just a few months ag..."

it's still doable, just not with the deadlines people are talking about

00:32:02	Ansgar Dietrichs:	just as a side note, in the very unlikely case of a headliner being dropped from a fork, I don’t think it would be proper to automatically schedule it for the next fork. that fork has its own scoping process, and there might be different priorities.
00:32:05	Daniel Lehrner (Besu):	Can CLs start to work on BALs and SLOTNUM in parallel to epbs, so we can ship that at least on the EL side
00:32:08	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "If there is anythi..."

What are the open issues that anyone sees at the moment with the current spec? Do they need to be figured out before devnet 0?

Famous last words 😂
00:32:46	Barnabas:	Replying to "Can CLs start to wor..."

it was done by LH in under a day
00:32:52	Barnabas:	Replying to "Can CLs start to wor..."

So I would assume its similar for every CL
00:33:10	Stefan Starflinger:	Replying to "Can CLs start to wor…"
We have 2 CLs ready
00:34:28	kingy_sigp:	yep sounds good
00:34:40	Potuz:	Replying to "If there is anything..."

nothing for devnet 0, there are some things about forkchoice changes, something about PTC deadlines and some open questions about builder discovery, but devnet 0 is frozen essentially
00:35:08	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "If there is anything..."

Yeah I guess that can be sequenced into devnet-1?
00:36:09	Luca Donno | L2BEAT:	Reacted to "just as a side note,..." with 👍
00:36:46	Potuz:	Replying to "If there is anything..."

those are mostly not hard forks so can be slowly be added to the same devnet 0 being run
00:37:02	Potuz:	Replying to "If there is anything..."

hopefully

00:37:51	Barnabas:	@Teku, can you let us know when we should be able to start spamming again?
00:38:24	Potuz:	is there any strong reason to spam on mainnet instead of Hoodi first?
00:38:31	Bharath:	We also need to start reviewing the builder-api specification for ePBS: https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/pull/138  
There are some minor updates that I am making to it today, but would definitely appreciate some running feedback on it.
00:38:42	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

Didn’t show up on hoodi or devnets
00:38:53	Barnabas:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

we want to see proper network effects
00:39:09	Barnabas:	Replying to "We also need to star..."

devnet 1 scope?
00:39:14	Chris Berry:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

Please give node operators a chance to get the mitigations in place before spamming mainnet.
00:39:19	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "Please give node ope..." with 👍🏽
00:39:36	Potuz:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

if these things are not showing on testnets we probably need other testnets
00:39:38	Bharath:	Replying to "We also need to star..."

Regardless of scope, would be nice to get reviews on the spec
00:39:52	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

The issue is that its impossible to clone mainnet on a p2p and mempool layer
00:39:55	Bharath:	Replying to "We also need to star..."

Can be done in parallel. But definitely not devnet-0, or even devnet-1 IMO
00:40:01	Potuz:	2 calls from now
00:40:10	Potuz:	we should be at least with a clear picture

00:40:30	stokes:	Replying to "we should be at leas..."

great
00:40:53	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "is there any strong ..."

Ie we need to first understand why something broke on mainnet to be able to copy over the logic to a testnet, something we have not been able to do since mainnet is obfuscated and random
00:41:04	Potuz:	Replying to "We also need to star..."

I would not scope direct connections for devnet 1 but rather the p2p pipeline cause that will integrate most of the external builder work without the need to add a direct http handler
00:41:51	Bharath:	Replying to "We also need to star..."

Yup agreed. My intention is to get feedback so we can iterate the specs in parallel

can we scope it for a not so soon bal devnet ?

what’s the process for that?
