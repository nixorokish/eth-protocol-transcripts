00:29:42	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "I would not push the..."

I mean, i would space them out more so that the high numbers only ship after slot restructuring
00:29:49	potuz:	Replying to "More compressed = le..."

I think in addition to these we need to account for the usual delay in actually blob space and usage catching up. It hasn't been immediate in the past
00:30:17	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "I would not push the..."

Is the bandwidth requirement for validators taken into account here when we are pushing those?
00:30:46	Barnabas:	I’d like to add that scheduling an extra BPO fork should be very easy.
00:30:51	Francesco:	Replying to "More compressed = le..."

We can spam mainnet to see high blob throughput regardless of real usage (as long as the 21k fee isn’t prohibitively high)
00:31:10	Parithosh Jayanthi:	For p2p stuff, mainnet data is kind of the only data that really matters. Any testing data just helps us derisk.

00:40:41	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I am a bit surprised, two speakers raising need for testing without getBlobsv2, sounds like that has been happening for weeks already, so is this more a case of lack of communication?
00:40:55	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I am a bit surprised…"
Or is this about different tests?
00:41:00	potuz:	no, this was a request for a long time Ansgar
00:41:14	J Sunnyside Labs:	Sunnyside Labs, we also tested without getblobsv2 and saw about ~15% less blob throughput (though it has been a while)
00:41:28	potuz:	this was already specified as a hard requirement to set a timeline before the previous ACDC
00:41:31	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Blobs were comming r..."

We did random checks and they were stably included, but we can come back with an inclusion analysis to see how much worse it gets without getblobsV2
00:41:47	Ansgar Dietrichs:	So main concern is more about code readiness for releases? Makes sense
00:41:51	Phil Ngo:	Replying to "I am a bit surprised..."

I think we also need to take into account the engineer’s confidence in their code. Otherwise tech debt gets merged in with it. We’re doing a lot of cleanup on hacky code that was done to make things work for devotes.

Yeh, there’s a tx propagation bug in reth/rbuilder - but it’s unrelated to blobs or peerDAS in itself. Just makes the data messier. We’ll get back with proper data once bugs are patched.
00:44:05	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "So main concern is m..." with 👍
00:45:07	Barnabas:	There was more time, which means that pectra was also delayed by like 3 months compared to initial target
00:45:42	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Okay, right, it is what it is, if these concerns exist, we can’t ignore them.

Of course "Fusaka pre Devconnect" has been a big goal - is there any world to allow for more time while still keeping the possibility of that alive? Say 2-4 weeks delay, and cutting out some weeks somewhere in our timeline from first releases to mainnet fork?

Just asking, not pushing for that
00:45:45	Tim Beiko:	If we delayed by 4 weeks, we could still ship in December, but we should consider what our go/no-go criteria are
00:46:51	potuz:	I think delays for master releases can be made semi-independent of releases for testnests. Specially Holesky for example
00:46:58	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "I think delays for m..." with 👍🏽
00:47:01	potuz:	so that the final delay is not so bad as the proposed 4 weeks
00:47:03	Barnabas:	I personally think the main issue is that we didn’t have enough engineering time allocated to fusaka, especially in smaller client teams. 

Ideally we need main senior engineers working on fork + 1, and allocate less resources on fork + 2 or fork + ?. 

If we had more engineers working on fusaka full time, we could have shipped 1st of Sep.
00:47:08	Manu:	Reacted to "I think delays for m..." with 👍🏽
00:47:14	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "I think delays for m…"
Maybe for Holesly, but IMO live testnets should get proper releases
00:47:16	Caleb:	Reacted to "I think we also ne..." with 👍🏽
00:47:50	Tim Beiko:	Yes, would be curious to understand this better, esp. given it shows up across multiple teams
00:47:52	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Could we do Holesky in September so it isn’t on the critical path? With non trunk releases
00:48:09	potuz:	Reacted to "Could we do Holesky ..." with 👍
00:48:52	Dustin:	Replying to "Could we do Holesk..."

non-trunk releases are a challenge for Nimbus. I mean, sure, we can point to a non-canonical release, but typically Nimbus doesn't do "testnet-only" releases
00:49:14	potuz:	Replying to "Could we do Holesky ..."

how are you running on devnet-3?
00:49:19	potuz:	Replying to "Could we do Holesky ..."

is it master?
00:49:25	Dustin:	Replying to "Could we do Holesk..."

it's a branch
00:49:35	potuz:	Replying to "Could we do Holesky ..."

yeah that's what I mean for Holesky
00:50:47	Chris:	Replying to "Could we do Holesk..."

I think this could end up being a pointless exercise. If we don't get full participation any bugs could get hidden in the noise. I have low confidence of getting full participation from all node operators if the releases are all on branches.
00:51:15	Barnabas:	we can aim to do a devnet 5 for 2nd sep
00:51:19	Barnabas:	that runs a week
00:51:24	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Can we get individual weeks from different places? Say 2 weeks by cutting down the delay between last testnet and mainnet, 2 weeks for not using master for Holesky, etc? Maybe we atill had a week of buffer pre devconnect as well?

So not just push everything back a month

00:51:50	potuz:	Replying to "Could we do Holesky ..."

00:53:34	Dustin:	Pectra got oops-delayed by another 1.5 months or so, maybe 1 month, by insufficient testing, as it happened
00:53:44	Dustin:	it was not a case of moving too slowly
00:54:42	Ansgar Dietrichs:	We could explore different timeline adjustments and make a decision on ACDT?
00:54:54	Justin Florentine (Besu):	was referring to the suggestion of testing early nets from non-merged-to-trunk clients. sounds like a good way to mis config opts, such as what complicated pectra

00:57:06	potuz:	Replying to "One thing is readine..."

because smaller testsnets don't have the bandwitdh issue of propagating blobs when the mempool is slower and is fully propagated
00:57:16	stokes:	https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1638#issuecomment-3161024180
00:57:18	Francesco:	Yeah testing is fine, just referencing the discussion on Monday about genesis syncing, which would need full nodes to go and try to grab 64 columns to reconstruct
00:57:21	potuz:	Replying to "One thing is readine..."

so it's imperative to test in a scenario where nodes can't get all blobs from the EL
00:57:21	pawan:	Replying to "One thing is readine..."

I agree gossip should work. Syncing is crazy given it takes 2 seconds to reconstruct blobs for a single block
00:57:26	Tim Beiko:	More of a process thing, but IMO it would have been more productive for each team to individually voice this async ahead of the call. We should minimize the element of surprise in these things as much as we can.
00:57:26	Barnabas:	Replying to "Regarding the audit ..."

01:25:24	Toni Wahrstätter:	I think no big CL feature should be added on top of ePBS. It alone touches enough major parts of the protocol and should be shipped in isolation to other changes, especially those affecting fork choice.

01:28:07	potuz:	Replying to "If we're potentially..."

I think with current numbers of propagation we should get at the very least 8 seconds execution for proposers and 10 seconds exectuion for attesters

I don't understand thje comment Francesco, if ePBS is already SFI, then we never are in a situation of needing to separate

@Sophia Gold Aha sorry. Yes, as potuz mentioned then. We get S-PTC_P in execution time. So if we set PTC_P early, we gain more.

Which seems like we might start doing next year onwards

there is no future of FOCIL without ePBS if it's actually SFId
01:35:36	Francesco:	Replying to "+1, if we start with..."

The opposite, “if we are not managing to ship the fork in time we take focil out"
01:35:47	Sophia Gold:	Replying to "How are we saying ..."

I think it's fine for it to be in H fork but not later. I'm sympathetic to arguments that deprioritizing it now means it won't happen in time

Any links about FOCIL <> zk?
01:35:50	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "+1, if we start with..." 

 The specs for both are still in progress, so, I wouldn't underestimate the complexity.
They interact, thus, removing one will be complex.

Echoing this, Tim's comment is exactly my favorite fork

i actually think getting both in would be worth delaying (within reason)
01:37:03	Ansgar Dietrichs:	if we accept FOCIL, we need to have super explicit agreement on process though.

“if it delays ePBS, we will kick it out” - that is not good enough, who makes that call, and when?

If we say we don’t wait for the CL headliner(s), then it is easy, then it is in the best interest of the ePBS champions to honestly track FOCIL delay concerns and act on them.
01:37:08	Francesco:	Feels like everyone is being delusional again with the timelines because otherwise the EIP will not get included

I would be fine with delaying to include both, up to about August
01:37:27	terence:	i see no reason not to CFI focil today, we are not SFI'ing focil

good thing we are not talking about deadlines

there has been no talk on Glamsterdam timelines as we did for Fusaka
01:38:07	soispoke:	Replying to "1-2 months delay ove..."

I think not considering broad community input and devs for a month delay would not be a good decision tbh
01:38:07	Ansgar Dietrichs:	so would we get a strong commitment from all CL clients to not dedicate any work to FOCIL until ePBS is stable?

sounds like that is what Alex just proposed
01:38:17	potuz:	Replying to "Feels like everyone ..."

I see Ansgar saying MArch, but ePBS will not be ready for March
01:38:21	potuz:	Replying to "Feels like everyone ..."

Depends on CL client team I think. Some team can working on both in parallel like Lodestar
01:38:47	Dustin:	Replying to "Feels like everyon..."

or Ansgar yeah
01:38:51	Francesco:	Replying to "Feels like everyone ..."

I didn't?
01:38:54	Barnabas:	Could I ask for dedicated CL engineers for glamsterdam scope? Same way as we did with peerdas.
01:38:55	Dustin:	Replying to "Feels like everyon..."

That's one of feedback I've gathered

You can't accelerate something just by putting more devs on it

no, there's no discussion, it's only Ansgar

I was responding to Ansgar. They should have as many as necessary for ePBS, but there's a limit. Presumably not the whole team

PeerDAS had no stable spec back then. FOCIL has stable specs in any regard
01:40:51	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "if we doing EL only ..." with 😂
01:40:52	Ansgar Dietrichs:	okay so we would not wait for say 2+ months for the CL headliner(s)?
01:41:08	Jihoon:	Replying to "so would we get a st..."

Sorry any regard is too much. I meant in CL, EL, engine API, rebase onto ePBS
01:41:16	Eitan:	Replying to "so would we get a st…"
I don’t think peerdas is even a fair comparison it’s a much more complex change than FOCIL

01:41:34	Barnabas:	There are plenty of work on ELs that can also delay a fork, if those repricing EIPs get included.

of course, good chance the EL is the one causing the delays.

Just talking about what if it’s the CL, and it’s a long delay
