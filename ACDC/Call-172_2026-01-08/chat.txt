Moderation in everything, including moderation =)

As pointed out in past instances of this discussion - it’s important to prepare for future growth of existing blob users, and future users who need certainty that we will be able to accommodate their needs. Worth keeping in mind

00:23:10	Leo:	Replying to "we should not rush..."

The number of daily blobs seems to be actually decreasing, so clearly not enough demand.

Given that we already had 2 BPOs I agree with Leo that without observed increase in demand we should not rush with increase
00:27:52	Matthew Keil:	Replying to "we should not rush t..."

+1
00:30:27	Marius van der Wijden:	Its not super easy to implement this on the el it would require a lot of additional work (screening the blocks for transactions in the txpool)
00:30:50	Potuz:	You already have to do this to produce an IL for focil
00:30:58	stokes:	https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-8081-hegota-network-upgrade-meta-thread/26876
00:31:01	Potuz:	It would be the same as checking IL satisfaction essentially
00:31:16	Barnabas:	wouldn’t it make more sense to bundle it with IL changes and not overload Glammy?
00:31:39	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

This is completely optional, clients can just return always “no”
00:31:55	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

It’s not consensus breaking and not fork choice decision is being made
00:32:02	Marc:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor…"
is it more of a makeshift until we have focil or you think it would be useful afterwards?
00:32:04	Jihoon:	IL satisfaction check is deterministic and not heuristics.
00:32:11	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

So for an EL to implement this is simply adding a boolean that always says “no"
00:32:22	Trent:	Replying to "we should not rush t..."

Not saying it needs to be rushed - just boosting context from past discussions as to why centering on current demand may miss important considerations
00:32:24	Potuz:	Replying to "It would be the same..."

It’s irrelevant for what I am requesting though
00:32:39	Ansgar Dietrichs:	it’s fine to have a bit of a discussion on themes today already, but I think we should mostly wait until we have all the headliner proposals
00:32:41	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

It’s a makeshift
00:32:43	Dima Gusakov | Lido:	Sorry for the dumb Q, but what is the good time for the non-headliner proposals?
00:32:50	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

using such a locally-available-info mechanism for focil is fine but not for blacklisting builders as mempools aren't standardized.
00:33:31	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

I disagree, the CL can track that a particular builder is actually censoring 100% of blocks, and others arent
00:33:42	Łukasz Rozmej:	theme: technical debt
00:33:42	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

And then decide then, with actual statistical information
00:33:48	Marius van der Wijden:	I think the theme for glamsterdam was scale, I don't think that needs to be the main focus for hegota
00:33:51	nixo:	Replying to "Sorry for the dumb Q..."

it’s in the ethmag link above - it’ll follow the headliner proposals
00:34:22	Jihoon:	Replying to "It would be the same..."

I also don't think it is right to say that ELs already have good heuristics for IL production. They will have to devise and implement their strategies.
00:34:34	Barnabas:	Replying to "theme: technical deb..."

marketing department does not approve this message.
00:34:38	Dima Gusakov | Lido:	Replying to "Sorry for the dumb Q..."

Got you. So it is late Feb early March
00:34:40	Dima Gusakov | Lido:	Replying to "Sorry for the dumb Q..."

Thanks!
00:34:54	Potuz:	Replying to "It would be the same..."

They can just say “this block is not censoring” and that’s fine
00:35:02	Potuz:	Replying to "It would be the same..."

That’s a very simple heuristic

Not sure champions are ready today to formally get into it
00:36:34	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

the problem is that the EL cannot really tell. Everyone can come up with their own heursistics but noone is right
00:37:08	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

So, the resp you get as a CL from different ELs is different over ELs.

That’s a good feature not a bug
00:40:59	Potuz:	100% of what Marius is saying
00:41:05	Potuz:	Can’t stress this enough
00:41:08	Matthew Keil:	Agreed
00:41:20	Matthew Keil:	And Technical Debt is a big part of this hardening…
00:41:26	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

If one EL has a higher tx size limit than the others than validators using this EL would blacklist all builders
00:41:57	Barnabas:	Reacted to "cccccdderlnfbbfhklvk..." with 🎉
00:42:09	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

It's a feature for focil, but not for blacklisting. We would have more accidential blacklisting events (without knowing that one happened) than real ones
00:42:38	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

Again, statistical inference works.  If that node operator wants to blacklist every builder that doesn’t include large txs that’s a feature
00:42:47	Potuz:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

They can do so anyway
00:42:58	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

Not being included also depends on being able to pay the basefee. ELs would not only need to track the time until inclusion but also for how long the tx has actually been able to pay the basefee
00:43:15	Jihoon:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

I also think it is better to not try to overload more feature to Glamsterdam especially if it's a makeshift.

This is kinda ridiculous, there’s no overloading, they can just say “this block is not censoring” and that’s it. Exactly what happened with the already existing boolean. And then Nethermind implemented it when they had time

00:44:27	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "wouldn’t it make mor..."

the mempool is a non-standarized space and we would certainly open this up to attack other builders, trying to get them blacklisted
