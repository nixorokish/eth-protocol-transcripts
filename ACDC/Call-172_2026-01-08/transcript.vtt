00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:48.740
stokes: Hello, everyone.

2
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.230
stokes: Happy New Year.

3
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:08.799
stokes: Okay, let's wait, about 2 more minutes, and then we'll get started, just as people… Keep streaming in.

4
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.640
stokes: Can everyone hear me? I'm just doing a mic check.

5
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.459
stokes: Okay, thanks.

6
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.190
stokes: Sometimes I have issues with my headphones.

7
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.980
Justin Florentine (Besu): Happy New Year, Ethernauts!

8
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.979
Justin Florentine (Besu): 2026, let's go!

9
00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.059
stokes: Happy New Year.

10
00:08:45.809 --> 00:08:48.539
stokes: It was a great intro from Justin.

11
00:08:56.789 --> 00:09:02.549
stokes: Okay, Josh, if you're helping with the stream, then I think we're ready to get started.

12
00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:07.460
Josh Davis: Alright, Alex, go ahead of your life.

13
00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.200
stokes: How are you, thanks.

14
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:18.500
stokes: Happy New Year, everyone! This is the first ACDC of 2026. It is call 172.

15
00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.049
stokes: Let me grab a link to the agenda, I'll put it here in the chat.

16
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:35.009
stokes: So, yeah, today, a couple things to cover, a few quick announcements, then we'll touch on Fusaka, Glamsterdam, and Agota. So…

17
00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.539
stokes: Let's get into it.

18
00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.619
stokes: I put these announcements first, because I think they should be pretty brief.

19
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:47.730
stokes: The first one is just a shout-out for a breakout on the task confirmation rule.

20
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:52.340
stokes: Let's see, is either Roberto or Mikael here to say something about that?

21
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.480
Mikhail Kalinin: Hey, I'm here. Happy New Year, everyone.

22
00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:06.210
Mikhail Kalinin: So… There is a fast confirmation rule, there is a PR that is open to the spec.

23
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.359
Mikhail Kalinin: And, we actually plan to… to have a…

24
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:29.130
Mikhail Kalinin: a couple of production-ready implementations in CL clients in a couple of months, like, by this beginning of March. And in order to facilitate the development of implementations, we want to introduce breakout calls.

25
00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:41.070
Mikhail Kalinin: Where we can discuss the progress, the challenges that developers see in implementing the algorithm, also incorporate feedback into this fact.

26
00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:52.860
Mikhail Kalinin: And, yeah, just basically share, the progress on tests and all these kind of things. And, these breakout call sessions, will be bi-weekly and start on January 20.

27
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:59.580
Mikhail Kalinin: In the meantime, we… it's a bit of an update, from…

28
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:08.450
Mikhail Kalinin: the spec and spec development side and testing side. We work on tests currently, so the spec is,

29
00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:19.800
Mikhail Kalinin: Let's say it's kind of final, but it will be final after more developers' feedback will be incorporated into it, so we need more eyes from developers.

30
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:31.450
Mikhail Kalinin: But it is final, it is ready to get implemented, and we are working on tests, and a bunch of tests with decent coverage will be ready by

31
00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:36.950
Mikhail Kalinin: By the beginning of February, by the end of January, Some kind of that.

32
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.779
Mikhail Kalinin: So this is our main priority now on this fast confirmation thing.

33
00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.260
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, that's… that's probably it.

34
00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:49.799
Mikhail Kalinin: Maybe, Will can add anything on that?

35
00:11:52.590 --> 00:12:03.459
Will Corcoran: No, we'll just be alternating, Tuesdays with, I forget, maybe a fossil, breakout room, so it's gonna be the first one starting

36
00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:11.829
Will Corcoran: tuesday, January… I forget, the 20th, I believe? It's at 2 p.m. UTC, and yeah, we'll…

37
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:13.689
Will Corcoran: We'll be running every other week.

38
00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:19.280
stokes: Okay, sounds good. Thank you both for the update.

39
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:26.449
stokes: So, yeah, very exciting work there. If you're interested to dig in deeper, join the breakout.

40
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:35.199
stokes: Okay, next, I don't know if Nixa's here, but she had a comment,

41
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:44.140
stokes: she actually worked at the PR, but I guess she and some others have been working on, refining this notion of champion.

42
00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:49.799
stokes: It's a document in the PM repo, I'll just grab a link to the PR here.

43
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:53.229
stokes: And I think, for now, it's essentially a request for comments.

44
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:58.020
stokes: So, take a look at that if you would like to contribute there.

45
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:09.440
stokes: Okay, so I think those were all the announcements we had, and yeah, let's then turn to Fusaka. So…

46
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:14.919
stokes: We did have this one event, that kind of extended over the holidays with the fork.

47
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.669
stokes: which was BPO2.

48
00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:23.510
stokes: The PO2 went live, I believe it was the 7th UTC.

49
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:30.649
stokes: And… yeah, generally, it went well. We have added more blobs to the protocol, so…

50
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:36.279
stokes: At least for, the bulb layer, the DA layer, we are scaling, which is super cool.

51
00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:42.360
stokes: Anyone have anything they'd like to add to, their observations of BPO2?

52
00:13:50.160 --> 00:14:03.899
Dustin: I have a question, actually, relating to this, slash observation, which is that there was some discussion about, well, people were looking for a full 21 blocks, and eventually did find them, yes.

53
00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:08.450
Dustin: But there was some question of… there were maybe…

54
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:15.140
Dustin: some reorgs people found, but I don't know if that they were looked at as whether they were statistically…

55
00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:33.280
Dustin: unexpected, or were they out of the usual distribution, so to say? And also, was there a particular reason why the 21 bobs was sort of so difficult to find? Why people were seeing 19 and 20, but not 21?

56
00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:41.650
stokes: Yeah, I'm not sure. Barnabas was there in the chat, they managed to hit multiple of these.

57
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:49.169
stokes: So, I do know I was looking right around the fork, and there was an early block, that was orphaned.

58
00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:51.630
stokes: And some of us were looking into it.

59
00:14:51.990 --> 00:15:00.089
stokes: the latest I saw was just, actually it wasn't really so much the bobs with that particular block, but just that it was released pretty late into the slot, so…

60
00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.110
stokes: Yeah.

61
00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:09.829
stokes: It's definitely something we should be keeping an eye on. That being said, I haven't seen anything, that would suggest

62
00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.960
stokes: An issue here, with this 21 number?

63
00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:14.870
stokes: In general.

64
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:16.710
stokes: There's just nothing else.

65
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:32.509
Barnabas: Yeah, I just feel like there wasn't enough transactions to have multiple 21 blob blocks, especially during the holidays. The average blob transactions also went down significantly compared to before the holidays.

66
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:38.820
Barnabas: So, Ed is just posting less blocked transactions, during the holidays.

67
00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.959
Barnabas: I… I'm expecting it to climb back up, eventually, though.

68
00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.319
stokes: Yeah, makes sense.

69
00:15:47.890 --> 00:16:01.480
stokes: I mean, yeah, I mean, I think for me, the takeaway is we did this, and yeah, the protocol seems good. We certainly want to do more analysis around these higher blob counts, especially before we think about increasing them further for future BPOs.

70
00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.200
stokes: Any other comments on BPO2?

71
00:16:17.610 --> 00:16:18.430
stokes: Okay.

72
00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:24.119
stokes: Then, in that case, we'll move to Glamsterdam. So…

73
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.200
stokes: Let's see here, a few things with Amsterdam.

74
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:35.370
stokes: Yeah, maybe just to play things back, just as we're wrapping it back up from the holidays, so…

75
00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:47.189
stokes: Yeah, we essentially closed out, scoping for the fork. There are a number of CFI DIPs, along with the SFI DIP of EPBS right now.

76
00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:53.910
stokes: And… yeah, that's, that's very good. Sets us up in a good place to keep moving forward with everything.

77
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:57.690
stokes: So, yeah, that's basically where we're at right now.

78
00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:09.250
stokes: In terms of EIPs, there are a few updates today, and one thing, I suppose the EL wanted to get a temperature check, or…

79
00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.400
stokes: Yeah, so just a confirmation on this call.

80
00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:17.350
stokes: And that's with EAP8070. This is the sparse Blob Pull EIP.

81
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:37.480
stokes: I think I might have missed exactly what the request was, but essentially, there was, I believe there was interest to CFI this on the EL side. They wanted to basically toss it back over to the CL side and say, hey, you know, just, by the way, any concerns, and if not, we'll go ahead and CFI it.

82
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.790
stokes: Odds are, yeah, maybe you can fill us in a bit more.

83
00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:49.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, you basically already said it, it's, the CAP, the Spot pool, it's pretty overwhelmingly EL-side, but,

84
00:17:49.540 --> 00:18:01.189
Ansgar Dietrichs: there is at least some elements of it that also touch the CL, and so it just didn't feel right to just CFI it without at least some… having the CL in the loop, so really this is more of a…

85
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:13.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: just in case they have any fundamental concerns about the CFP from the CR side, basically, please voice them, otherwise we would just continue moving this to CFI. So, yeah, really just a quick heads up, basically.

86
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.820
stokes: Okay, and to be clear, we should CFI this.

87
00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:24.860
stokes: And if someone… have the concern, they should voice it now. Otherwise, it will be CFI'd.

88
00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.369
stokes: As of this call.

89
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:35.120
stokes: Okay, then let's CFI.

90
00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:38.809
stokes: Thank you, Oscar.

91
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:57.739
stokes: Okay, two more updates to EIPs in Amsterdam. The first one here is from Etan. There's a question around the tree shape of how the stable containers feature is implemented.

92
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:02.030
stokes: This, I think, is an update to EIP7688.

93
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:08.439
stokes: There's a comment here that goes into more details,

94
00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:14.170
stokes: But that being said, let's see, is Itan on the call? It's probably better if you just give us an overview. Oh yeah, there you are.

95
00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.090
Etan (Nimbus): I hope this time my mic works again.

96
00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:18.450
stokes: I can hear you.

97
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:19.970
Etan (Nimbus): Traveling last.

98
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:20.989
stokes: It sounds good.

99
00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:28.660
Etan (Nimbus): So yeah, the shape here, is based on a feedback that I received end of last year.

100
00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:37.419
Etan (Nimbus): If we switch to the right shape, there is an advantage that the later entries in an array

101
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:50.019
Etan (Nimbus): are also more to the right in the tree, and that, can help with incremental tree construction a little bit. It's a very small change only in the library.

102
00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:56.310
Etan (Nimbus): EIP diff is literally this PR, it's just, like, swapping,

103
00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:03.029
Etan (Nimbus): the order of, how the hash is formed. And I just wanted to ask if everyone is okay here, or if anyone…

104
00:20:03.310 --> 00:20:12.979
Etan (Nimbus): has a strong opinion to not do that. Otherwise, I would just go ahead with this as the final spec change to this data structure.

105
00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:21.950
stokes: Are there any concerns here with backwards compatibility, of Merklization of the other…

106
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.460
stokes: you know, types or features in SOC?

107
00:20:24.850 --> 00:20:27.280
stokes: Or is this just contained to stable containers?

108
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:35.709
Etan (Nimbus): It's only for the new stuff. Okay. It's only, like, for the 7688. That's actually the other thing that…

109
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.100
Etan (Nimbus): Like,

110
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:51.949
Etan (Nimbus): I proposed merging it last month, and then I received feedback from POTUS that Justin was working on this big PR to make builders non-validators. I think that one has happened, so…

111
00:20:52.340 --> 00:21:03.629
Etan (Nimbus): I wonder whether, there are more blockers there, or, like, what's the… what's the timeline there? When should we go ahead with 768 and put it in?

112
00:21:05.210 --> 00:21:12.789
stokes: Yeah, generally, you know, the process we try to follow is having one EIP at a time, so…

113
00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:21.130
stokes: We would want to get to, like, very stable dev nets with EPPBS, and then think about, sort of, promoting CFIDIPs to SFI.

114
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:29.350
stokes: That being said, like, yeah, it has been CFI'd, and so, you know, now is the time to have the conversations we're having now.

115
00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.139
stokes: To iron out, you know, all these different details.

116
00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:40.310
stokes: And that being said, there are multiple questions here in the chat, just, yeah, hearing more about pros and cons.

117
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:43.020
stokes: Miao, would you like to speak to that?

118
00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:51.490
Etan (Nimbus): Yeah, the pro is… like, it's a very small, thing, obviously, like, the hash count is the same.

119
00:21:51.550 --> 00:22:07.989
Etan (Nimbus): And so on. The pro is, really like that when you create an incremental tree construction, similar to what we had back in the deposit contract snapshot, that you can sort of continuously collapse all the

120
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:14.659
Etan (Nimbus): Trees as soon… like, you only have to track, like, a boundary that switches from left to right through the list, right?

121
00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:21.039
Etan (Nimbus): And you can continuously collapse what's on the left side, because new data is only added to the right of the tree.

122
00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:26.530
Etan (Nimbus): That's the advantage there. The downside is that it makes it…

123
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:31.559
Etan (Nimbus): A tiny bit more complex to, think about.

124
00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:42.929
Etan (Nimbus): generalized indices, like, when you really have this low-level view of it. For example, making a multi-proof, it makes it a tiny bit more challenging to get it right, but…

125
00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:51.040
Etan (Nimbus): I mean, it's really a small, cone and a small pro, like… We can also…

126
00:22:51.800 --> 00:23:05.489
Etan (Nimbus): not do it, and everything would also be fine. But given that we don't have any specs that use it yet, I think we should go ahead and just do it the more future-proof way.

127
00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:15.079
Etan (Nimbus): Streamable… It can be streamable.

128
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.520
Etan (Nimbus): like…

129
00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:30.330
Etan (Nimbus): it depends how you make the protocol. Like, it's not made in that way. It also doesn't affect serialization, right? So,

130
00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:40.659
Etan (Nimbus): But, yeah, if you think about streamability, having the continuous data more closer together in the tree.

131
00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:45.660
Etan (Nimbus): is… is… is the slight pro that we get. But, like, the… it's only, like, the…

132
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:52.520
Etan (Nimbus): the number of hashes doesn't change, right? So… It's like just mirroring it.

133
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.000
stokes: Okay.

134
00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:04.159
stokes: I think in terms of moving forward, if there are no other questions at the moment,

135
00:24:04.690 --> 00:24:08.889
stokes: I would suggest we take feedback to the PR, that you linked here.

136
00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.059
stokes: Oh, this is to the IPs, let's see…

137
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:19.779
Etan (Nimbus): Yeah, like, maybe as a C channel, and if there is no opposition in a week, then I'll just go ahead, I think.

138
00:24:20.520 --> 00:24:22.100
stokes: Yeah, that sounds reasonable.

139
00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:30.849
stokes: Okay, so yeah, jump into the SSG channel on the ETH R&D Discord if you want to discuss further.

140
00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:32.680
stokes: Thanks.

141
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:45.719
stokes: Okay. Next up, POTUS had a proposal here to add some notion of when a node can detect censoring.

142
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:53.749
stokes: And that then goes into… I think it was the fork choice. Yeah, Potos, would you like to say more?

143
00:24:54.820 --> 00:25:02.679
Potuz: Sure. So I want to propose a change in the engine API, which is very much close to what we already have.

144
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:13.349
Potuz: So today, the EL, when we request a local payload, when we're about to propose, the EL has a Boolean that says.

145
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:22.919
Potuz: There's been censoring on the chain, you can use it however you want, but CLs can use this to take that block instead of the builder's block.

146
00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:30.089
Potuz: So, what ePBS gives us is a better version of this, which is…

147
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:46.199
Potuz: when we send a new payload for validation to the engine, the engine replies with valid, syncing, accepted, whatever it is, and then also adds a Boolean that says, this block was censoring according to my view.

148
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:53.590
Potuz: And then the CL can use this, because now the CL has information of who was the builder that built that block.

149
00:25:53.710 --> 00:26:06.320
Potuz: And then the CL might use it to blacklist that builder, not request bids from them, blacklist it temporarily, whatever it is. So that will be up to clients to make it configurable by the operator.

150
00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:15.750
Potuz: But the actual change that I'm requesting is to have this extra Boolean on the engine API on the call for new payload.

151
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:21.610
Potuz: most of the… of… of notify Nupelo. Most of the changes

152
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.389
Potuz: would have to be on the EL side.

153
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.020
Potuz: To make that decision and say this was censored or not.

154
00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:37.629
Potuz: And… and these changes are mostly already worked out on clients because of the way of satisfying the inclusion list.

155
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:54.520
Potuz: for fossil. So this would be mostly about, like, have they seen transactions that were in the mempool for long enough, and those transactions could have been included in this block, and they weren't included, and then the EL can say, this block was censoring or not, for example.

156
00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:04.680
stokes: I feel like we've discussed a Boolean like this in the engine API in the past. I guess that's not currently in the engine API.

157
00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:08.230
Potuz: I'm sorry, we discussed what?

158
00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.059
stokes: a Boolean like this, I thought.

159
00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:29.459
Potuz: It is. It is already, and it is implemented. It is implemented in Nethermind, and Prism already takes this into account. I think other clients already do this too. But this is implemented in the only way that we can do this now, which is in the call to get block, which is only the proposer that can actually make a local decision right there when they are proposing.

160
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:41.239
Potuz: This change is much more drastic in that I'm proposing to have this Boolean now in the call to notify new payload. This happens for every validator on every single block.

161
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:51.140
Potuz: So validators can keep track of which builders are censoring for every block, because now they have this visibility that before they didn't have.

162
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:53.900
stokes: I see, okay.

163
00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.419
stokes: Tony, your hands went up.

164
00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:13.979
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I'm not sure if this is a good idea, because today, how the mempool works, it's not standardized over clients. So, for example, we had, different transaction size limits over different clients. We also had different, minimum tips.

165
00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:17.260
Toni Wahrstätter: that different clients had implemented, so…

166
00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:35.399
Toni Wahrstätter: Notifying your payload is fully deterministic over different nodes today, and this would basically mean some dynamic info that is very much node-dependent, and even dependent on the configurations and flags you use, would suddenly become part of the response.

167
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:46.009
Toni Wahrstätter: So, yeah, I'm not sure if this is… if this is a good idea. For example, what could happen is that I would allow larger transactions for my node, because I run a certain client.

168
00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:52.049
Toni Wahrstätter: And then I would perceive every other block as being censoring, just because they don't include

169
00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.140
Toni Wahrstätter: Those very large transactions.

170
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:58.579
Toni Wahrstätter: And also, as a builder, I would have no insight when I would be blacklisted.

171
00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.899
Toni Wahrstätter: So it's very much, I would have to wait until

172
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:07.160
Toni Wahrstätter: the next registration of that validator, to even figure out that I was blacklisted.

173
00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:21.570
stokes: Yeah.

174
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.870
stokes: I mean, it's an interesting proposal.

175
00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:31.910
stokes: Are there any further comments right now, or questions? Otherwise, put us at ask where you'd want to continue the conversation.

176
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:51.570
Potuz: I think I'll propose the same thing on ACDE, because most of the changes would be on the engine, on the EL, and then after that, we can just… I mean, these discussions are being held now on the EPBS channel.

177
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.560
Potuz: I think that's… that's a good channel to continue.

178
00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.570
stokes: Okay.

179
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:06.789
stokes: Yeah, I at least want to think a bit more, and, you know, also with respect to what Tony said, you know, just all the different implications of doing this.

180
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.719
stokes: Great. Thank you.

181
00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:19.749
stokes: Okay, I think that was everything for Glamsterdam. Any other points for Glamsterdam?

182
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.530
stokes: If not, we'll move to Hagota.

183
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.610
stokes: Okay.

184
00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:43.529
stokes: Great. So, like I said, we're in a pretty good place with scoping of Amsterdam, and then we introduce, the headliner process.

185
00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:50.179
stokes: To move forward with Heza and Hagota. So… As a quick reminder.

186
00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:56.970
stokes: There's an overview of the process and the current timelines on this Ethan Magicians post.

187
00:30:57.470 --> 00:31:00.009
stokes: Let me grab a link, it's there in the chat.

188
00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:04.809
stokes: And, essentially, we are moving forward with scoping Hagota.

189
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:14.619
stokes: And to begin, we have headliner proposals. So, the way that this works, it's very similar to the headliner process we introduced with Amsterdam.

190
00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:19.489
stokes: Essentially, starting today, for about a month, we'd have a proposal period.

191
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:37.179
stokes: So, the way this works, again, very similar to Glamsterdam, you should have a proposal post on these medications, tag it with this Hagota tag, and then bring this proposal to some ACD call, again, you know, pick the relevant layer.

192
00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:40.009
stokes: And yeah, then…

193
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:46.109
stokes: The way it would work is, by having the post, and then also, you know, a…

194
00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:51.169
stokes: conversation, let's say, on ACD about it. That would be the formal proposal.

195
00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.590
stokes: for that particular EIP as a hubliner.

196
00:31:54.040 --> 00:32:03.370
stokes: And this process will run for, again, like I said, about a month, then we'd move into discussion and selection for the headliner.

197
00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:04.820
stokes: So…

198
00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.469
stokes: We're just starting this process today, so I don't know if there'll be that much to talk about.

199
00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.340
stokes: That all being said,

200
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:22.290
stokes: Yeah, following the process we kind of have laid out for Glamsterdam, there's this notion of fork focus, or the theme to the fork.

201
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:35.219
stokes: I wanted just to, you know, sort of respect that part of the process, and if anyone would like to chime in around what they think the fork focus or theme should be, we can start that conversation today.

202
00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:39.589
stokes: Again, if you want to say something, let's keep it short.

203
00:32:39.690 --> 00:32:48.459
stokes: I think ultimately, you know, this information is helpful, but yeah, I don't think we should get too caught up on exactly what the theme is.

204
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.539
stokes: As again, I think most of us have a pretty clear idea of

205
00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:55.600
stokes: different AIPs we might want to move forward with for Hagota.

206
00:32:57.690 --> 00:33:01.360
stokes: So, would anyone like to say anything about, the theme, briefly?

207
00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.710
stokes: Sounds fair.

208
00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:32.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, maybe the only thing I wanted to say from more the EL side, I think sometimes there are hard folks where it naturally lines that EL and CL are focused on, like, things that have one integrated bigger theme to it. I think that is the case with Glamstadlam, for example. I think that could still happen with H-Star,

209
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:40.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: we should be open to that, but I don't think there's any reason to, like, to be too adamant about trying to buy us a fork in that direction, and I, so far at least.

210
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:54.549
Ansgar Dietrichs: don't think it's clear that that's where we will be going with edge stuff. So I think, yeah, theme is maybe one of those things where, like, if it's not apparent that we naturally have it for a fork, it's fine to maybe just not overforce that as a lens.

211
00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:57.260
stokes: Yeah.

212
00:33:57.450 --> 00:33:58.599
stokes: Makes sense to me.

213
00:34:00.670 --> 00:34:06.570
stokes: Okay, yeah, if anyone would like to add any more on this point,

214
00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:11.940
stokes: I would suggest going to this ETH Magicians post that I linked, and just adding a comment there.

215
00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:17.989
stokes: And otherwise, yeah, I think that was…

216
00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:25.160
stokes: most of what I had today, again, this is kind of more of an announcement that we're starting the process, just to be clear.

217
00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:39.280
stokes: Proposals have to be made before the 5th of February of this year. So, what that looks like, again, is like I was saying, where you need to have an ETH Medicions post up, and then also have presented it on an ACD call.

218
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:44.540
stokes: And, the way this works is… the…

219
00:34:45.110 --> 00:34:49.820
stokes: Deadline here would be by, I think it's an ACDC on February 5th.

220
00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:53.939
stokes: So, yeah. Again, you have a month, and…

221
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.159
stokes: From there, we will keep the process moving.

222
00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:08.340
stokes: I think that's about all we should touch on today. Would anyone else like to add any comments or have any questions?

223
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.310
stokes: Is that a theme, Marius?

224
00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.340
stokes: That you're… you would like to talk about? Or have in the… in the meta?

225
00:35:30.070 --> 00:35:36.500
Marius van der Wijden: Mmm… It was more of maybe a topic that we can discuss.

226
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.709
Marius van der Wijden: Because I feel like this is going to…

227
00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.830
Marius van der Wijden: Have a lot more focus in 2026, and since we

228
00:35:45.050 --> 00:35:48.569
Marius van der Wijden: Still have, like, an hour left,

229
00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:53.280
Marius van der Wijden: I think it would be… would be nice to talk a bit about seal hardening.

230
00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:55.750
Marius van der Wijden: I know there's been a lot of…

231
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.310
Marius van der Wijden: Work done in the last year.

232
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:08.740
Marius van der Wijden: And, I'm… I'm very curious to hear from consensus Layer clients how they feel about CL hardening,

233
00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:17.300
Marius van der Wijden: So that we don't get these… these kind of issues that we got on the… the testnets for Petra, and… and so on.

234
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:25.260
Marius van der Wijden: So, I don't know, if we have time to talk about anything, I think CL hardening would be, like, a good topic to talk about.

235
00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:35.210
stokes: Sure, yeah. Would anyone like to speak to that?

236
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:37.970
stokes: Any client team?

237
00:36:50.570 --> 00:36:51.430
stokes: Bonus.

238
00:36:52.770 --> 00:37:02.000
Potuz: perhaps not hardening per se, but, one thing we could coordinate, is into trying to schedule Demets

239
00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:12.029
Potuz: For, something that some clients already have implemented, which is, starting checkpoint syncing from a non-finalized checkpoint.

240
00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:28.119
Potuz: And trying to socially decide if we have a couple of finalized checkpoints, this is final, and we just go, or if we have known finalized checkpoints, but we're very fort, this is the final checkpoint, and we're just gonna decide that the network is this, meaning

241
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.539
Potuz: Socially recovering from an invalid finalized checkpoint is something that we haven't rehearsed.

242
00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:42.039
Potuz: And we do not know how to do, and in particular, Prism hasn't even implemented this. So we could, at least set a timeline, or…

243
00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:46.519
Potuz: Or… or start focusing on how to implement and how to test this.

244
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:56.569
stokes: Yeah, you mentioned, like, multiple finalized checkpoints. Is that the scenario, or is it an invalid finalized checkpoint, a singular one?

245
00:37:56.570 --> 00:38:03.349
Potuz: So… most… I mean, the two most important ones would be no finalization, and we're for it.

246
00:38:04.010 --> 00:38:10.270
Potuz: And the other one is, we have finalized an invalid checkpoint, something like what happened already in a testnet.

247
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:13.320
Potuz: And… and we cannot recover from that.

248
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:21.270
Potuz: So, in finalizing an invalid checkpoint and not finalizing at all, and we need to just choose one branch.

249
00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:28.210
Potuz: Otherwise, we're gonna go into, like, inactivity leaks, and then split, eventually, the chain.

250
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:37.150
stokes: Yeah, I mean, if we did finalize an invalid checkpoint, we'd have to manually recover from that.

251
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:46.700
stokes: Presumably some flag that says, hey, you know, when I go process the network, ignore this, even though you see it as finalized.

252
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.779
stokes: That's been implemented. Okay.

253
00:38:51.360 --> 00:39:06.269
Potuz: That's been implemented on every client, like, blacklisting blocks, it's been implemented on every client, but if we go back to the situation in which we had on testnet, that we would slash a bunch of clients because of a bug.

254
00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.649
Potuz: Because they would surround themselves… I mean, we had a bunch of clients that were deadlocked in that situation.

255
00:39:12.830 --> 00:39:19.289
Potuz: This requires social interaction, and then even just continuing on the other branch, which was valid.

256
00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.820
Potuz: We just don't know how to do this today, so finding a solution for that would be nice.

257
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:33.120
stokes: I agree.

258
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:38.129
stokes: I also don't know if, the people here today are prepared.

259
00:39:38.290 --> 00:39:39.940
stokes: To get into this much further.

260
00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:44.719
stokes: But yeah, that is… That is a good point.

261
00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:49.449
stokes: This is one thing to be, you know, very concerned about.

262
00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:56.940
stokes: this is kind of, I think, a pretty extreme scenario. I imagine Marius also had a less extreme scenario than mine, just around…

263
00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:00.609
stokes: You know, how… how clients are.

264
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:13.719
stokes: resilient just to different things on the network, even before, yeah, bad finalization, just various, you know, DOS vectors, or, yeah, syncing and non-finality and different scenarios like this.

265
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:30.879
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, exactly. I don't know, like, when I talked to CR… unfortunately, we didn't have a good time in the last couple of months to have, like.

266
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:46.589
Marius van der Wijden: like, these bigger group discussions between EL and CL. But when we talked in Berlin, it was, like, one of the major, through-lines was that the CL teams feel kind of rushed, and they would like to

267
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:55.079
Marius van der Wijden: They would like to focus more on security, they would like to focus more on hardening, they would like to focus more on…

268
00:40:55.330 --> 00:40:57.740
Marius van der Wijden: On… on… yeah.

269
00:40:57.970 --> 00:41:02.620
Marius van der Wijden: Exercising these code paths, and…

270
00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:12.229
Marius van der Wijden: I… I'm just wondering how much of that has… Already happened, and…

271
00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:26.040
Marius van der Wijden: if… I don't know, it doesn't seem to me to be that big of a problem if no one is… no one feels like speaking up on the call about it. But I…

272
00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.739
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, maybe technical depth.

273
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:36.050
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I'm just wondering what the current thinking is on all of these topics right now.

274
00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:54.299
stokes: I know we all have a lot of calls, but we could have a formal breakout for this.

275
00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.109
stokes: That might be a nice way to move forward.

276
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:16.130
stokes: Any other client team want to speak to us?

277
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:18.430
saulius: Hmm.

278
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:21.320
stokes: Otherwise, I'm not sure there's more to say today.

279
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:27.390
saulius: I just wanted to say that it… I mean, the… the recent…

280
00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:35.189
saulius: Goals or vision is to have, like, a two-hot works per year, and this is, like, a…

281
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:55.369
saulius: a different direction of what Myris is saying, and I don't think that there is that much time and focus left after the actual features development to focus a lot on technical depth,

282
00:42:55.370 --> 00:43:01.020
saulius: cleanups, you know, security stuff, and so on. So…

283
00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:19.499
saulius: Yeah, I think this is, at least for the small teams, this could be, one of the reasons why it's, it's really hard to find the time to, to do something else apart from building, new, new features, and,

284
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:22.779
saulius: And just catching up with, with,

285
00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.650
saulius: With the development, in terms of the features.

286
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:33.470
stokes: Yeah, I mean, there's certainly the trade-offs there that we're all very keenly aware of.

287
00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:37.080
stokes: You know, tying this back.

288
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:40.650
stokes: I just thought someone said something.

289
00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:53.859
Matthew Keil: I wanted to dovetail in the discussion about, pushing the BPOs, looking at blob consumption, you know, they're not necessarily necessary at this particular moment, and they're relatively easy to turn on.

290
00:43:53.870 --> 00:44:10.259
Matthew Keil: But not having that hang over our heads of, like, make sure you're watching your notes, make sure things are not happening, you know, that also kind of plays into that pressure that, that takes away from our focus of being able to develop the features and do other cleanup.

291
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.470
stokes: Alright, yeah, so again, there is a trade-off here.

292
00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:31.670
stokes: tying this back more through today's agenda, with Hagota scoping, you know, one… one way to square these two is, as we move forward with scoping, just keeping this in mind, and then having, you know, Hagota be a lighter fork.

293
00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:36.760
stokes: Because then there's, you know, less pressure to develop new features, because there are simply fewer of them.

294
00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:40.069
stokes: And there's more time for all these other things we've been discussing.

295
00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.540
stokes: Okay.

296
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.519
stokes: Any other comments on this?

297
00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:04.339
stokes: Morris is asking how people feel about EPBS security.

298
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.100
stokes: what I would say myself is, again, we have good testing,

299
00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:18.020
stokes: For the state transition and things like that.

300
00:45:18.370 --> 00:45:25.150
stokes: There are fork choice changes to EVBS, which are… Yeah, more interesting.

301
00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.520
stokes: Miguel?

302
00:45:29.950 --> 00:45:32.750
Mikhail Kalinin: Yeah, probably can add on that,

303
00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.769
Mikhail Kalinin: If we fall, remember we have,

304
00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.090
Mikhail Kalinin: We have this FOC Choice compliance test ensued that…

305
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:47.260
Mikhail Kalinin: is not… I… to my knowledge, is not integrated into any client except for Taku.

306
00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:54.889
Mikhail Kalinin: That far, and, we… we are planning to apply To actually,

307
00:45:55.050 --> 00:46:01.430
Mikhail Kalinin: catch up with the EPBS changes and introduce them into this test institute.

308
00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:08.259
Mikhail Kalinin: And, from the developer's perspective, it means that, Developers will have to.

309
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:12.720
Mikhail Kalinin: kind of adopt this testing suit. I don't know how much of

310
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:21.030
Mikhail Kalinin: Of time and efforts, and engineering efforts it will require, from the development perspective.

311
00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:25.590
Mikhail Kalinin: Obviously, depends on the client, and yeah, fine design.

312
00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:29.260
Mikhail Kalinin: But this is something that, should,

313
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:33.330
Mikhail Kalinin: Help a lot with testing the fork choice changes.

314
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:41.960
Mikhail Kalinin: So, yeah, that's just, you know, from the test in front, and from the… yeah, in the application to EPBS.

315
00:46:44.010 --> 00:46:45.330
stokes: Yeah, that's a good part.

316
00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:51.939
stokes: Given the change of the PBS, this is, probably a very good time to double down on that set of tests.

317
00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.830
Potuz: So…

318
00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:06.760
Potuz: eBBS has been on the discussion for… until, like, not long ago, on whether or not we would have certain features, like trustless payments and so.

319
00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:21.069
Potuz: And then we decided at the very last minute to make a rather big change, which is not making the builders validators. And we already know that there's some bugs there. We already know that there's some bugs at the protocol level on how to handle deposits, for example.

320
00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:24.440
Potuz: Which is kind of natural, the PR just merged last week.

321
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.269
Potuz: So…

322
00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:33.200
Potuz: Yeah, so we expect to continue finding this kind of bugs for a while, until we actually do go into interrupt.

323
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:42.870
Mikhail Kalinin: By the way, yes, I didn't mention that we're also, kind of aiming to…

324
00:47:43.460 --> 00:47:50.779
Mikhail Kalinin: to use model-based, model-based testing that we use for the FOC Choice stuff, also for the stage position,

325
00:47:50.930 --> 00:47:54.509
Mikhail Kalinin: For the EPBS scope. For the whole APBS scope.

326
00:47:55.730 --> 00:47:58.060
Mikhail Kalinin: So we'll just, you know, give it a try.

327
00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.920
stokes: Yeah, I think these are all good things to have on our minds as we move forward into the new year.

328
00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:19.150
stokes: And we think about Glamsterdam and Hergoto.

329
00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.020
stokes: Any other comments today?

330
00:48:37.830 --> 00:48:38.650
stokes: Okay.

331
00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:43.549
stokes: If not, anything else that was not on the agenda?

332
00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.770
stokes: If not, I think we wrap up early.

333
00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.210
stokes: And… Happy to be here, everyone.

334
00:48:56.520 --> 00:48:57.820
Potuz: Happy New Year.

335
00:48:58.790 --> 00:49:00.510
stokes: Okay, yep, let's wrap in.

336
00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:01.540
stokes: Bye, everyone.

337
00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:04.350
Mikhail Kalinin: Mine.

338
00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:05.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Bye-bye. Happy New Year.
