00:14:19	Barnabas:	mic dao
00:15:04	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "mic dao"

we are in the “centralized era”, the modern equivalent to a dao would be to appoint a mic czar

We also added a disclaimer to this to clarify the intent 😄
00:19:27	terence:	prysm is making a release today which is recommended on top of 6.0.0
00:20:05	Barnabas:	are these updates require a bump on the blog post tho?
00:20:14	Barnabas:	Usually the less changes the better
00:20:20	Tim Beiko:	Lol, I was just DMing Sean about it
00:20:34	Barnabas:	Would only bump if something critical shows up imo.
00:21:19	Barnabas:	maybe put a + behind the ones that have newer versions?

Do you know what clients are part of the network? ( or is it all of them?) hard to determine from their docs

00:24:48	terence:	is there a devnet7 spec?
00:26:00	stokes:	Replying to "is there a devnet7 s..."

Hmm I can’t find what I thought I saw
00:26:04	stokes:	Replying to "is there a devnet7 s..."

So lets say no atm
00:26:29	stokes:	Replying to "is there a devnet7 s..."

Sounds like it would be devnet-6 + maybe validator custody
00:27:23	Barnabas:	How hard it is to impl?
00:27:37	terence:	I have a PR out, just not sure if I should merge it or not
00:28:10	Phil Ngo:	Replying to "Gnosis mainnet fork ..."

Lodestar and I know Nimbus does. Can’t speak for the other teams tho

@Tim Beiko I want to clarify that for relays/builders (anyone who relies on the payload attributes event stream) v6.0.1 does have a critical bug fix.
