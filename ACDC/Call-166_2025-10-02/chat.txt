with one client we aren’t doing devnets 😄

we gonna do devnets when we have at least 3 client implementation

Maybe 2 is a better requirement.
00:22:35	Parithosh Jayanthi:	I want to avoid the alt as well though, what if we spend time merging to develop and then change the design and need to redo the full cycle?

00:29:15	ethDreamer (Mark):	Rational actors will bypass
Rational actors will use direct point to point connections to builders but there is no incentive to bypass the in protocol mechanism - it was carefully designed so there was no incentive to do this
00:30:01	Lorenzo:	Replying to "Rational actors wi..."

There is an incentive if off-protocol bids are different than in protocol ones
00:30:03	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Rational actors will..." 

 One incentive is getting the payment faster and another that you can have it call code (e.g. be automatically distributed)
00:31:13	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

@Lorenzo 
You need to be clear what you mean by “off-protocol” - hitting a builder directly and accepting a bid that wasn’t gossiped is NOT off-protocol - they still use the protocol to adjudicate the payment
00:31:59	lightclient:	Reacted to "@Lorenzo 
You need t..." with 👍
00:32:00	Lorenzo:	Replying to "Rational actors wi..."

By off protocol I mean a low unconditional payment, with the majority coming from the EL payment
00:32:19	Chris Haug:	Reacted to "By off protocol I me..." with 👍
00:33:02	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

Ah so you mean if builders offer different bids for bypassing the protocol and using relays - I don’t see why they would do that fundamentally
00:33:55	Lorenzo:	Replying to "Rational actors wi..."

Many reasons, two main ones: 1) it's expensive for the builder to keep capital staked, 2) if the slot is missed the builder misses the full payment for potentially little profit
00:34:31	Ansgar Dietrichs:	one specific argument for why I would rather not have unconditional payments in Glamsterdam at all:

I think it adds significant complexity to ePBS and will delay fork readiness (this point is controversial, many EF researchers I talked to disagree).

And given we have limited room in Glamsterdam, I think there are higher urgency items like FOCIL. I think ePBS + unconditional payment + FOCIL is too much CL-side for Glamsterdam. And I think FOCIL is much more important and urgent than unconditional payments
00:34:39	Chris Haug:	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

it’s more about having a 0-bid from “whitelisted builders” and the actual “off_protocol_bid” amount offchain through relays
00:34:47	Chris Haug:	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

@ethDreamer (Mark)
00:34:49	Greg K | Lido:	Reacted to "one specific argum..." with 👍
00:34:58	Sophia Gold:	If we split out trustless payments, there are still several variants of pipelining only ePBS (e.g. dual headline and parent header). I suggest we should try to not only decide this but also which flavor of pipelining by end of month in order to not delay development
00:35:00	Chris Haug:	Reacted to "one specific argumen..." with 👍
00:36:11	Ansgar Dietrichs:	but I also feel like this topic is being sprung onto the ePBS champions right now, so we should give room for that conversation to happen fully informed. We already accepted ePBS in full as headliner, so default would absolutely be to keep it that way.
00:37:02	Francesco:	I don’t quite understand this point. We don’t need to keep using mev-boost and do any blind signing, like discussed on discord
00:37:43	Francesco:	Having the builder sign the payload is different from trustless payment though (meaning the withdrawal mechanism, the need to be staked, the fork-choice things)
00:38:25	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

@Chris Haug I understand what is meant but I wanted to be clear about terms in the discussion
@Lorenzo what do you mean by 2)?

00:39:44	Jihoon:	Reacted to "one specific argumen…" with 👍
00:39:50	Francesco:	I think there’s 3 things:
Still use mev-boost (not sure what’s the point of that)
Current thing with trustless payments
Current thing but without withdrawal mechanism, counting weight, fork-choice changes etc…
00:39:52	Lorenzo:	Replying to "Rational actors wi..."

the unconditional payment is paid by the builder regardless of whether the slot lands, so a missed slot is very risk for the builder, potentially bidding in many blocks become -EV
00:40:05	Ansgar Dietrichs:	the on-the-merits conversation on unconditional payments should maybe happen offline? would be best to focus on “should it be part of the headliner or a separate EIP proposed for Glamsterdam”
00:40:33	Toni Wahrstätter:	Trustless payments should have been separated out from the beginning and would have been a potentially nice feature by itself. Now that it's in, it's probably better to keep it as-is(?)
We should use it as a fallback and make it as smooth as possible for proposers to continue using relays if they want to. Keep it as fallback but not as default.
00:40:36	Stefan Starflinger:	Reacted to "one specific argumen…" with 👍
00:40:53	Greg K | Lido:	I am pretty much in the same page with Ansgar. 

PBS1 (Payload - Block separation): Good for scaling, widely accepted
FOCIL: Good for censorship resistance, widely accepted
Trustless payments: Not clear to everyone why needed, esp. benefit vs complexity.

00:41:28	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

the unconditional payment is paid by the builder regardless of whether the slot lands

Again you need to be clear. If the proposer misses the slot, the unconditional payment is absolutely NOT paid. If the BUILDER misses the reveal, it is still paid. Of course because that would be the builder’s fault. But relays already enforce this with optimistic relay designs anyway?

Would like to see missed slot rates on a testnet before forming an opinion. Like unless they’re ~zero it will probably affect bids.

00:45:09	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "iirc we close G* for..."

I think we don’t need to stick to very specific pre announcements we made on this, but can just pick a reasonable process now that we are close to that point

00:45:14	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Rational actors will..."

If the proposer’s block is re-org’d then the payment is re-org’d.. why are we worried about missed slots from the proposer?
00:45:28	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "iirc we close G* for..."
