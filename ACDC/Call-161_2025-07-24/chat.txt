Concentration of all attestations being at the same time (because that’s a bias in this test by looking at missed blocks)

well they have less room to spread around, so we want them to be more concentrated. shorter slots without any other intervention don’t just concentrate attestations by themselves
00:29:59	Francesco:	Replying to "How many validators ..."

you can extrapolate some results for the ePBS world, after 1.5s you’d have both the exec payload propagating + blobs and the attestations etc. mixed effects then, attestations are not in the “hot path” but they may compete for bandwidth more than today

So the thing is just that we now want to use a larger portion of the slot for propagation, so the problem gets worse.

I think this is becoming a bottleneck soon if these numbers are right
00:39:54	ethDreamer (Mark):	Any proposal where there is a time delta between transaction selection and the deadline for all components of the block must be available will be vulnerable to this option problem
00:40:42	Raúl Kripalani:	the network load placed by attestations is radically different to everything else (many tiny fragments in a bursty way), so i'm sure we're incurring more overhead than we should (e.g. we could even batch attestations to amortize validation time and MTU utilization)

00:41:02	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

The particular problem though according to the computation by Christoph et. al. is proportional to MEV and therefore to the slot time so making the slot shorter doesn’t substantially help
00:41:05	Francesco:	Replying to "@Raúl Kripalani do y..."

Another dumb thing is, I don’t think the current number of committees is optimal (more committees => each single attestation topic is smaller but the global aggregates topic has more messages)
00:41:09	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

Ahh what he is saying now
00:41:27	Raúl Kripalani:	i.e. if we decouple "unit of work" from "message/attestation", i think several clever optimizations open up
00:41:42	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Any proposal where t..."

Wait what? That does’t make sense. You can’t retroactively invalidate a payload if it was valid from the start and all components are available
00:41:56	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

ah, hm right
00:41:59	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Any proposal where t..."

If it was invalid from the start, you have no option

00:42:20	Barnabé Monnot:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

right but all else equal shorter slot times help no? you’d have half the MEV per slot, but twice the slots?
00:42:25	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Any proposal where t..." 

 Here you "invalidate" your payload by not publishing >50% of the blobs
00:42:38	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

No, this is explicitly the statement they make
00:42:46	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

It’s the time relative to the slot
00:42:55	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Any proposal where t..."

I said “deadline where all components are available”
00:42:56	Marius van der Wijden:	So we need to make the penalties for builders more severe?
00:43:00	Francesco:	Replying to "EL only DE is pipeli..."

Yes but fwiw this not a CL-DE problem either, it’s specifically a commit/reveal problem. It is in principle possible to do CL-DE with full pipelining (including PTC) but no commit/reveal, but what has to be given up for that is trustless payments (not clear how to do them without commit/reveal)
00:43:13	Trent:	Reacted to "btw the post for rea..." with 👍
00:43:34	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Any proposal where t..." 

 So, you publish your valid el payload early and the whole el payload turns "invalid" at the ptc deadline if the blobs are not revealed
00:43:40	Raúl Kripalani:	do we think having a confident answer here is blocking us from choosing the headliner? (ie. what priority should we (p2p) give to this?)
00:44:04	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

right, at least with perfect slot usage, shorter slot times would no longer help.

currently they would help, because we can’t use full slot for propagation, so ratio gets better
00:44:19	Potuz:	Replying to "EL only DE is pipeli..."

Not a commit reveal for the payload but for blobs is the main issue. ePBS with a single short PTC deadline doesn’t have this problem as per these guys computations
00:44:27	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "These numbers are ho..."

they're probably affected by the same Hermes issue as my attestation CDF chart from Berlinterop
00:44:31	Potuz:	Replying to "EL only DE is pipeli..."

And it’s still commit-reveal
00:44:37	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

which also means that this effect is directly proportional to throughput - we can make it better by artificially throttling throughput
00:44:39	Potuz:	Replying to "EL only DE is pipeli..."

But loses blob propagation scaling
00:44:40	Francesco:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

I think there’s a fundamental difference between having commit/reveal and not having it, because having commit/reveal means that the entire allocated propagation window fuels the option’s value, whereas without commit/reveal the end of the auction is close to the latest time when you can propagate the data
00:44:51	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Any proposal where t..."

I guess if you include publishing early.. but why would you do that?
00:44:57	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

I’m replying to this in a different thread so I’ll copy there
00:45:27	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "Any proposal where t..."

You created an option you already had by publishing on time. It’s more expensive publish early and waste the block rather than just publishing on time
00:45:38	Potuz:	Replying to "This is a fundamenta..."

00:46:32	NC:	If this option is valuable, wouldn’t it be reflected in the bid price? ie. builders are willing to pay a premium for it and they will lose more when they decide to withhold
00:46:36	soispoke:	Replying to "So we need to make t..."

It’s not clear yet we would need to do that I think it all depends on results from empirical data. If what builders bid (and always lose) is a lot greater than their profits then the dominant strategy is already to reveal and not withhold the block: https://collective.flashbots.net/t/the-free-option-problem-in-epbs/5115/9?u=soispoke
00:46:59	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "So we need to make t..."

Instead of penalties (that are hard to do) I think it’s trivial to return a percentage of the bid to the builder when the payload is processed
00:58:00	Francesco:	Replying to "“seems like there ar..."

Seems to me that the realistic choices are:
Accept this problem and move on with 7732 (with current knowledge of the free option problem I find this really uncomfortable)
Remove trustless payments and commit/reveal for now, do everything else that epbs does to keep maximal compatibility with it (maybe we change how things work with blobs later/gain new insights and can revisit)
Go back to some other delayed execution proposal (not sure why)

The slot restructuring contained on its own can be implemented without rustless payments, let’s call that feature EIP-7732A. Now let’s call the trustless payment feature EIP-7732B which depends on EIP-7732A. Now you can signal support to either EIP-7732A or EIP-7732B.

I wonder if the majority want as headliner EIP-7732A or EIP-7732B

01:15:15	soispoke:	Replying to "I’d suggest eth-magi..."

I think making one venue the “record of truth” is a bit tricky to start with tbh
01:15:15	Potuz:	Fully support investigating these numbers

01:15:38	ethDreamer (Mark):	I don’t see how we can argue we shouldn’t do pipelining without better understood data - and not also argue that we shouldn’t do slot shortening without better data
01:16:18	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think we should get better at making decisions that have immediate impacts.

ePBS is mostly a long term feature. Short term it gives more throughput, but we get that anyway from Glamsterdam.

shorter slots would be a much more noticeable immediate feature for users.
01:16:19	Mikhail Kalinin:	+1 (to Potuz)
01:16:22	Barnabas:	Question is, can we do deep investigation of this data in the next few weeks, in order to have 6s slot time still deliver in reasonable amount of time? Or will it take months of investigation?

01:16:50	Barnabé Monnot:	my view:
obviously would be best if we had 100% confidence that 6s is a no-brainer technically
numbers today don’t prove unequivocally that it’s impossible however
if we committed to doing 6s for glamsterdam, I believe we’d likely be able to pull it off
ePBS doesn’t give us much more room either, so anyways P1 to understand the data and think about optimisations
01:16:57	Sam Jernigan:	Reacted to "+1 (to Potuz)" with 👍
01:17:01	Phil Ngo:	Replying to "I’d suggest eth-magi..."

It’s hard to aggregate so many different venues. Even eth magicians doesn’t have a canonical thread for this AFAIK, there’s a few related to Glamsterdam topic

This is false: ePBS makes Fusaka possible right now
01:17:11	Sophia Gold:	Replying to "I think we should ..."

If we don't ship any form of pipelining in Glamsterdam it will set back zkEVMs by a year
01:17:14	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Without it Fusaka is useless

That’s DE

wait what’s the fusaka argument?
01:19:27	nixo:	Replying to "I’d suggest eth-magi..."

that thread is highly discussed based, looking to standardize opinions in some format
01:19:29	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Fusaka sets the ground to increase blob count substantially, but it can’t achieve much with 2 seconds to broadcast
01:19:42	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

With ePBS you multiply this by 4-5
01:19:52	nixo:	Replying to "I’d suggest eth-magi..."

it just makes it clearer to sort through
01:20:02	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Actually scaling immediately giving infinite gas to rollups (and also allowing late execution)
01:20:08	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

This impacts users immediately

01:20:31	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

any version of Glamsterdam would increase the propagation ratio of the slot
01:20:33	Francesco:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Not with the second deadline shortly after the attestation deadline 😄
01:20:33	Lion dapplion:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

*with payload decoupling
01:20:51	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Sure, I am advocating for the scaling version
01:21:06	Lion dapplion:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Such version doesn’t exist yet right?
01:21:12	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

what?
01:21:13	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

ePBS does add delayed execution over pure slot restructuring, but that only helps to further scale execution, not propagation
01:21:33	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

Yes it scales propagation more than execution!
01:21:43	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

The deadlines are about 4 seconds for the payload and 10 for the blobs
01:21:47	Barnabas:	I think we need to find a better way to handle feature forks
01:22:07	Trent:	Replying to "I’d suggest eth-magi..."

FWIW I don’t see the problem with pushing people to collect responses in a single venue
01:22:11	Potuz:	Replying to "I think we should ge..."

This was the whole point of the early discussion on free options
