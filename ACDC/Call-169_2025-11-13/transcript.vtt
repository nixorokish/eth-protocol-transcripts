00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:48.940
vitalik: Hello!

2
00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:04.470
vitalik: It's all… it's always annoying when everyone starts off silent, because you can't tell whether or not the audio is broken, but glad it's not.

3
00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:07.140
nixo: Good morning.

4
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.350
stokes: That is annoying.

5
00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:12.970
stokes: Good morning, Nixo.

6
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:20.799
stokes: Let's see, let's give people another minute or two, and then we'll get started.

7
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.360
stokes: People like to stream in around now.

8
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:30.410
stokes: Okay, I feel like this is usually the number of people we wait for before we kick things off, so let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.809
stokes: Josh, are you helping with the stream?

10
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.779
Josh Davis: You are alive, Alex.

11
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.290
stokes: Okay, thanks.

12
00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:48.829
stokes: Hello, everyone. Welcome to ACDC. This is number 169. It is issue 1790 in the P&M repo.

13
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.700
stokes: I dropped a link to the agenda here.

14
00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.819
stokes: And, yeah, just by way of summary, so…

15
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.340
stokes: We'll touch on any Fusaka things,

16
00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:07.960
stokes: yeah, there's a few things there. Then, you know, we're in this process of scoping Amsterdam, so we'll, try to make headway there.

17
00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:20.549
stokes: As a reminder, yeah, there's a handful of CLEIPs we can touch on today. There's many more ELEIPs, so yeah, it's probably going to take another call or two to get that, you know, work through, final scope there.

18
00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:29.069
stokes: But yeah, hopefully we can make good progress on the CL side today, and, you know, even pretty much, finalize things. So…

19
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:42.909
stokes: Let's see what we can do. And with that, let's start with Fusaka. So, I think the first thing, we did have BPO2 on Hoodie, I think it was yesterday, or maybe the day before.

20
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:47.659
stokes: Yeah, actually it was almost exactly 24 hours ago, so…

21
00:08:48.090 --> 00:08:55.249
stokes: Pretty cool. Anyone have anything they'd like to share from there, or anything else on the other testnets?

22
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.840
stokes: From what I saw, BPO2 went pretty well.

23
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:14.890
kev and pandaops: Yeah, we haven't noticed anything, but the team's also mostly been traveling yesterday, but there was no participation drop or anything funky on the peer-to-peer layer, so seems to have gone well.

24
00:09:16.370 --> 00:09:20.699
stokes: Okay, great. And have we started spamming blobs at the higher limits now?

25
00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:21.950
stokes: Alright, hoodie.

26
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.380
kev and pandaops: We should have, but I can check the config.

27
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:26.900
stokes: Okay.

28
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:31.430
stokes: I'm not saying blog fees are going crazy, which…

29
00:09:31.710 --> 00:09:35.489
stokes: Is that a good sign? Crazy good.

30
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:43.819
stokes: Emma, do you mean, like, they're going up, or they're jumping all over the place?

31
00:09:45.810 --> 00:09:47.100
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: They're… they're high.

32
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:49.959
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: They're pretty high.

33
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.109
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: That's what I meant.

34
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:52.100
stokes: Yeah.

35
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.570
stokes: Okay.

36
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:56.740
stokes: Something we can look into.

37
00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:02.039
stokes: Potus, would you like to mention the attestation issue?

38
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:06.590
Potuz: Not particularly, but… Okay.

39
00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:10.170
stokes: Okay.

40
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.720
stokes: Then I'll reach out after.

41
00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:18.919
stokes: Anyway, okay, there's some chatter about Hoodie.

42
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:26.089
stokes: Anything else, though? Generally, yeah, the test nights have gone really smoothly, and things look pretty good.

43
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:39.589
stokes: Okay. If not, then there was a request, and I wasn't quite sure where to put this, here from Holger.

44
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:46.280
stokes: So, he points out that BPOs don't have a place to live in terms of, like, EIPs or meta-EIPs.

45
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:54.329
stokes: And, you know, maybe to make, make the point, we have the current BPOs tied to the Fusaka Meta EIP.

46
00:10:54.940 --> 00:11:10.420
stokes: You know, presumably there'll be more BPOs throughout the future. They can go to future Meta-EIPs, but part of the whole strategy with BPOs is that we can have, you know, flexibility to do what's almost, you know, quote, interfork, changes.

47
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:21.620
stokes: And then there, the question is, like, yeah, how do we want to think about these? It's good for documentation, you know, specification, and just, you know, honestly, communication for everyone to understand what's happening.

48
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:28.549
stokes: With these changes. So, there's a question around how to think about this.

49
00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:40.670
stokes: We chatted a bit on, the ETH R&D Discord, and I think we basically got to a place of having, like, some sort of interfork meta-EIP, something like this.

50
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:48.290
stokes: I don't know if Holger is on the call today, but in any case, would anyone like to chime in further?

51
00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:54.390
stokes: Or if you have any, yeah, any thoughts.

52
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:59.869
stokes: or strong opinions on how to do this. I think some kind of interfork MIDIP is probably the way to go.

53
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:08.260
stokes: Okay, yeah, there was…

54
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:18.880
kev and pandaops: The main issue I see with having a new BPO-only EIP is that we would kind of mix Fox and BPOs again.

55
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:32.629
kev and pandaops: So you would need some logic that says that BPO123 happened after Fusaka, but BPO 456 happened after Glamsterdam, and if you separate the two, then it's kind of hard to know which sequence things get applied in.

56
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:38.410
kev and pandaops: And this is for the CLs, because they built the state on top of the last fork.

57
00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:39.500
stokes: No.

58
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.840
stokes: So, then instead, would you just…

59
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:51.509
stokes: Okay, so, like, let's say we have VPOs in between Fisaka and Amsterdam. You think we just put the new VPOs onto Fusaka Meta EIP?

60
00:12:51.510 --> 00:12:59.190
kev and pandaops: That sounds sane to me, or we have some meta-fork tracker that says this is a sequence of all forks that happen.

61
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:02.050
stokes: Right.

62
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:05.820
stokes: Okay.

63
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.380
stokes: In any case…

64
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:17.129
stokes: There was some discussion on, the Execution Dev channel. Let me just paste this here in case someone wants to go find it.

65
00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:27.149
stokes: on the ETHRD Discord server, I don't have a link to the message, but it's pretty recent in the stream, so yeah, just go check out the channel, if you want to chime in.

66
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:35.459
stokes: And yeah, Dustin, I think, is essentially lessening what Perry said about tying it explicitly to Fusaka, so…

67
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:39.400
stokes: Yeah, we'll figure that out before we get to…

68
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:48.180
stokes: the next VPOs we want to deploy, and yeah, have it in a way that makes sense for everyone. Thank you, Nixo. There's a link there in the chat.

69
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:51.340
stokes: Okay.

70
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.680
stokes: Anything else on Fusaka?

71
00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:00.269
stokes: Otherwise, yeah, mainnet is scheduled to arrive. What is that?

72
00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.300
stokes: Basically, a little over 3 weeks.

73
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.500
stokes: So, that's super cool. And… Yeah.

74
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.179
stokes: Anything else? If not, we'll turn to Glamsterdam.

75
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:20.290
stokes: Okay.

76
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:23.849
stokes: Let me refer to the agenda.

77
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:30.709
stokes: Okay, I did want to start with a check-in on APBS, so, you know,

78
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:36.650
stokes: like I was saying, a big topic today is going through the rest of the Glencer Damn scope.

79
00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:41.020
stokes: And selecting non-Hemliner EIPs, for the fork.

80
00:14:41.450 --> 00:14:55.189
stokes: That being said, we do already have the headliner with EVBS, and yeah, did want to do a quick check-in, if there's any updates people want to surface on the spec, or progress on DevNets.

81
00:14:55.480 --> 00:15:05.489
stokes: As far as I understand, we're still pretty early along, with implementation progress, which means, yeah, there's not, like, for example, an EPS, EPBS DevNet Zero yet.

82
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.930
stokes: But, yeah, there's definitely people working towards one.

83
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:36.130
kev and pandaops: Can we have at least something that's, like, a local Kurtosis DevNet, or something working with some clients, and a potential deadline associated with that? Because I fear that we wait until January, then we start doing interop, and then we take, like, 6 months to figure out interop, so I'd rather we start that process earlier. Even block-level access lists are not finished by any means, there are plenty of bugs, but

84
00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:42.480
kev and pandaops: Trying to develop… Along with, Interop helps figure out a lot of those bugs earlier.

85
00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:46.000
stokes: Who knows?

86
00:15:47.270 --> 00:16:03.590
Potuz: workloads. The problem was that we kept, adding things to structures in the CL repo, and that means that we need to wait for new releases to have test vectors so that we can actually pass static tests.

87
00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:16.480
Potuz: But, this seems to be now stable. Teku, as far as I know, is the one… is the client that is closest, to be able to run in Cortosis. They already are forking with the… with the new specification.

88
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:33.820
Potuz: Prism is starting to merge. I expect that it's going to go fast now, that we can actually merge into our developed branch, so we hope that in a couple of weeks, we're going to be in a much better position to start testing ourselves, and then running Cortosis with Teku. I don't know about other clients.

89
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:45.690
Potuz: The one thing spec-wise that, that I wanted to mention is that we might have some changes, on the engine API,

90
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:57.980
Potuz: These are minor things, like adding a Boolean here or there, and but it'll be nice to, like, have this talk with EL devs, probably not in ACD, probably ACDT, perhaps.

91
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:07.789
Potuz: And depending on what happens with the scoping for Glamstadan, we have different options to what we can do on the engine API.

92
00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:12.420
stokes: notes.

93
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.619
Potuz: Perhaps the major thing that I wanted to mention is that

94
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:33.379
Potuz: We spoke here on ACD about off-protocol payments, and how builders will, will, like, signal that they are willing to make a bid, to pay on the execution layer, and not go through the trustless mechanism. We,

95
00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:42.859
Potuz: Originally, we were thinking on putting this on the engine, on the builder API, so that it's… there's, no consensus record of what this value was.

96
00:17:43.060 --> 00:17:47.870
Potuz: But, we were convinced that it's better to put it on the execution bid.

97
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:56.159
Potuz: So, builders will have to actually put this value if they want, and it's going to go in the bid itself, in the signed part of the bid itself.

98
00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:01.770
stokes: Anyway, thanks for the update.

99
00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:04.730
stokes: To Perry's point…

100
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:12.779
stokes: I mean, I'll just throw this out here. Is it unreasonable to aim for a DevNet in, like, a month from now?

101
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.919
Potuz: I think it's not, it's hopeful.

102
00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:19.310
stokes: Okay.

103
00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:32.609
stokes: I can be hopeful. So, yeah, I think then that would maybe help put some bounds on things, even here, like Terrence is saying, like, maybe we don't need the engine API changes you were mentioning in the first subnet, so…

104
00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:38.809
stokes: I think it might put some… some helpful boundaries on things, just to start the R&D process moving further along.

105
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:46.839
stokes: So… Yeah, let's… let's have those rough targets, having, you know.

106
00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:55.439
stokes: even if it's cobbled together with kurtosis and things, something that, you know, we can start messing with and work towards more of an interop setting, like Perry was saying.

107
00:18:56.490 --> 00:19:02.189
stokes: you know, around a month from now, mid-month December, and yeah, let's see how that goes.

108
00:19:03.330 --> 00:19:07.139
stokes: Anything else there on EPVS?

109
00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:10.760
stokes: If not, we can turn to the next section.

110
00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:26.650
stokes: Okay, and before we jump in, I did put this here on purpose, just to drive the point home that, you know.

111
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:31.580
stokes: We should be very mindful of how we think about scoping, which is the thing we'll get into next.

112
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:44.659
stokes: We do have EBPS as a headliner. It and itself is, like, quite a big EAP, so we should just keep that in mind, and, you know, not add every last EAP, and try to have a reasonable balance here.

113
00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.440
stokes: Ryan.

114
00:19:50.890 --> 00:20:00.780
Ryan Berckmans: Hi, good morning. An EFT member saw a post of mine and suggested that I stop by to call today. I'm here to argue for EPBS being the only,

115
00:20:01.100 --> 00:20:16.709
Ryan Berckmans: headliner in Glamsterdam, or rather to keep Glamsterdam as scoped down as possible, to ship as fast as possible, to unlock additional blob scaling as fast as possible, and thus for the exclusion of Fossil from Glamsterdam.

116
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:35.510
Ryan Berckmans: My reasoning for this is that Ethereum's L1 plus L2 model is really finally starting to work. BaseChain and world chain L2s are growing extremely quickly. They both have a direct business line of sight to dramatically increase their blob… blob use.

117
00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:44.939
Ryan Berckmans: And so, the downside risk here is that base chain or world chain may leave blobs for Alt-DA in the worst case.

118
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:50.680
Ryan Berckmans: And… I see the L1 and L2 model as being,

119
00:20:51.290 --> 00:21:04.359
Ryan Berckmans: just on the cusp of public acceptance. And eventually, the model will be mature… sufficiently mature that any particular L2 leaving blobs won't shake confidence in the underlying model or in Ethereum.

120
00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:21.800
Ryan Berckmans: But that's really not where we're at now. We're currently in a transitory period of nascent public acceptance of the whole enchilada. And so, I think this would be a really terrible time for some of our top customers to think or act about leaving blobs for AltDA, and

121
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.329
Ryan Berckmans: Based on their growth trajectories.

122
00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:36.989
Ryan Berckmans: it seems that months matter, and so I think there is a customer circumstance argument to keep Glamsterdam as small as possible, including the exclusion of Fossil. Thank you.

123
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:40.760
stokes: Okay, thank you.

124
00:21:41.390 --> 00:21:51.970
stokes: Right, we… I was going to jump in a bit differently, but yeah, thanks for sharing that perspective. Hopefully everyone can just keep it on their minds.

125
00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:55.240
stokes: Kevin, Panda Ops,

126
00:21:55.440 --> 00:22:03.270
stokes: I was going to have client teams give, like, a quick overview of their positions before we really get into things, so I don't know if this is a response comment, or…

127
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:15.839
kev and pandaops: It was a response comment, and just one thing we want to point out, that there's also a couple of peer-to-peer changes in the pipeline, especially over the next, like, half a year, and we've decoupled what

128
00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:28.599
kev and pandaops: how blobs scale from forks themselves. We can do a BPO without shipping lamps to them. But yeah, that being said, yes, better fork cadence and tighter scoping always makes sense.

129
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.090
stokes: Okay, yeah, that's a good point, thanks.

130
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:38.790
stokes: Okay, yeah, as I suspect, things…

131
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:45.689
stokes: Might get a little animated as we go. Let's try to follow the agenda, just so there's a bit more sequence here.

132
00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:51.899
stokes: And… In that case, okay. Let's,

133
00:22:53.930 --> 00:23:07.060
stokes: Here, let me just do it like this. So, we have these, EIPs here as non-headliners, and, right, we have EPPS as the headliner. Our task today would be to select which other non-headliners we want to go in.

134
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:14.900
stokes: We'll see what we can do. If we can't get through them all, or come to our summer of consensus, you know, we can do that over the next call.

135
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:28.050
stokes: Timing-wise, just to keep things moving, it would be ideal if we can come to some consensus today. So, yeah, let's try to do that, and everyone just keep that in mind.

136
00:23:29.290 --> 00:23:38.989
stokes: I think to get started, I would like to have, the client teams, if they'd want to give, you know, maybe a brief overview of their different positions.

137
00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:46.969
stokes: Some of them came in over, you know, even the last few hours, so I haven't had time to kind of organize them all.

138
00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:50.220
stokes: So yeah, I think that might be a nice way to do this.

139
00:23:50.920 --> 00:24:02.009
stokes: I've read through them, I can give a quick overview from my take. Okay, actually, the tech one just came in here. But yeah, ultimately, they're linked on the agenda here.

140
00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:05.789
stokes: Maybe… here, let me just go in the order we have.

141
00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:15.920
stokes: And let's try it that way. So, Taryn's posted here, with Prism. Would someone from Prism like to give a short overview of their position?

142
00:24:17.870 --> 00:24:23.980
terence: Yeah, since I posted it, so… I guess TLDR is dead.

143
00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:28.520
terence: We're in favor of 80457688.

144
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:36.460
terence: For the 8071, we have the homework of just, like, understanding that

145
00:24:36.810 --> 00:24:41.419
terence: Shorten the subjective year to 7 days,

146
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:53.660
terence: the numbers are right, the numbers here meaning that the new churn, portioned, so I'm still studying that as well, but I'm sure it's fine, so yes, we will prefer

147
00:24:53.950 --> 00:25:00.880
terence: 8061 over 8071, for the reasons I mentioned in the description.

148
00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:09.090
terence: But 8062, we're a little divided in a way that, like, not sure, like…

149
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:23.769
terence: which approach is best, and changing consensus code is always a scary thing for these type of things. And 7805 fossil, we are neutral, but we do worry about, like, adding complexity.

150
00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:33.150
terence: because EPBS itself is already complicated, such that it will push your grams to then, mandate deadline to potentially end of next year, yeah.

151
00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:36.620
stokes: Okay, thanks.

152
00:25:38.250 --> 00:25:50.830
stokes: Let's see… I'll just go by client teams for now, and I think the next one here would be Lighthouse. Would someone from Lighthouse like to give an overview?

153
00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.590
kingy_sigp: I, yeah, I can… I can speak.

154
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:55.900
stokes: Okay, thanks.

155
00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.840
kingy_sigp: So yeah, so… for us, the TLDR is we…

156
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.509
kingy_sigp: we think the timing is… is right for Fossil, and we don't think the…

157
00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:12.199
kingy_sigp: We don't think the implementation will add too much, overhead, such that we should

158
00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:16.990
kingy_sigp: really panic about being able to deliver, EVBS, but we acknowledge that

159
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:24.520
kingy_sigp: EPBS is going to be complicated, and big enough on its own that we really have to be careful what else we tag along with it.

160
00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:28.469
kingy_sigp: So our position is basically do fossil.

161
00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:34.980
kingy_sigp: Ascend fossil at the same time, and everything else, we hold off for hecker.

162
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:38.849
kingy_sigp: Except that we would like to see some…

163
00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:55.799
kingy_sigp: some way to address the consolidation exit queue workaround, because we don't… we don't think that that's, intended behavior. So either 8071 or 8061, whichever is… is more appropriate. We're preferencing 8071 because it's a one-line change.

164
00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.790
kingy_sigp: But yeah, that's… that's basically where we stand now.

165
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.160
stokes: Okay.

166
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:03.100
stokes: Thanks.

167
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.979
stokes: Let's see, next we had…

168
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:14.190
stokes: There is quite a bit of conversation here. Okay, I think next thing we have, Lodestar.

169
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:20.739
stokes: Would someone from Lodestar like to walk through their thoughts?

170
00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:35.149
Lodestar Team: Hey everyone, this is Phil here from the Lodestar team. So, basically, to summarize it, we have a TLDR that we strongly believe that fossil should be included.

171
00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:52.060
Lodestar Team: In Glamsterdam, we currently estimate an additional engineering effort of about 2 weeks for our implementation on top of EPBS. So for us, the lift is not very heavy for us to include fossil, which is why we believe we can include it.

172
00:27:52.740 --> 00:28:08.100
Lodestar Team: And really, if that's, like, the only thing, we would be pretty happy. But we do have some other positions on some other EIPs, which I'll quickly skim through. We feel, that 7688

173
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:20.860
Lodestar Team: has been stagnated for quite a while, and, would be nice to get in. Also in terms of the perspective of… we have… also have customers that are looking to get that in as well.

174
00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:26.540
Lodestar Team: And 8045 is a nice, simple

175
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:35.889
Lodestar Team: fix as well, so we would be okay with that. In regards to the remainder of the things, we have a different…

176
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:48.750
Lodestar Team: opinions here about this, but we are very well aware that we want to ship as soon as possible, so we've also just decided to, potentially think of

177
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.969
Lodestar Team: those maintenance EIPs more for an H-star fork.

178
00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:55.700
Lodestar Team: And I don't see anybody

179
00:28:55.990 --> 00:29:02.009
Lodestar Team: here that is nodding their head and no, so I think, what I said here represents our view at Lodestar.

180
00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:06.110
stokes: Okay, thanks.

181
00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.720
stokes: Nimbus. I was stumbling from Nimbus here that I would like to give an overview.

182
00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:26.170
Dustin: Yes. Yeah. Sure, so… Broadly, so we… we support, 7688 as… as well. I mean, this is…

183
00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:34.269
Dustin: And… for, essentially, the reasons that have been… have been described, I would note, that

184
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:50.909
Dustin: Diva, Wido, I mean, various of the large staking entities have shown up here, and in fact, Diva posted in that, in the thread, noting that this directly, benefits them. So, that's 7688.

185
00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.499
Dustin: We also support 8045, this is…

186
00:29:55.840 --> 00:30:00.659
Dustin: From our perspective, a fairly simple, straightforward bug fix in the spec.

187
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.580
Dustin: Yep.

188
00:30:04.090 --> 00:30:10.150
Dustin: we… Support 8070, 81,

189
00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:20.029
Dustin: Which, the reasoning there, essentially being that you have the consolidations that was, I mean, it's simply not an intended path.

190
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:30.830
Dustin: the moment I start seeing people, for example, I mean, and here I'm speaking, I guess, personally, because I can always speak to my reactions on this, but… but,

191
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:46.600
Dustin: in… in ETH R&D, sort of talking about, well, let's have switch paths, like, depending on which, is the consolidation path right now faster than the regular exit path to me. I'm sorry, but that is crazy.

192
00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:51.150
Dustin: That is crazy. No. So, we have to just cut that off, from my perspective.

193
00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:58.020
Dustin: So… things which lead to that kind of discussion, so… Anyway.

194
00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:10.129
Dustin: We, Nimbus overall, Fossil, this is a key point, I think, that I think can be one of the bigger discussions. I am broadly aligned, I mean, so I have to say, I,

195
00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:21.459
Dustin: I've read some of the others, but broadly aligned with the idea that we support Fossil in principle. It's good, it's the future of Ethereum, great. However,

196
00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:30.000
Dustin: The… it should… it's… implementation complexity should not be underestimated, and it's not only implementation complexity, but testing complexity.

197
00:31:30.010 --> 00:31:46.880
Dustin: And one point I want to highlight here is that both EPBS and Fossil add sidecars, separate network sidecars. Now, it took months to stabilize this for Deneb, that was ancient history now, but it took a long… but even then, we've had

198
00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:54.459
Dustin: issues pop up around, in the columns in Fugu, and what the gossip validation rules, and we are…

199
00:31:54.510 --> 00:32:08.279
Dustin: gaps in them. These are… not simple. Net worth sidecars are never simple. So, and adding two of them in one fork is significant. They may both be worthwhile, but… yeah.

200
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:17.419
Dustin: What don't we support? We don't support 8061, which, weakens network security. We don't support 8062.

201
00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:27.889
Dustin: Which is… the intu… the intuition is there, from the EIP proposer, but it's… it's a… it…

202
00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.890
Dustin: Comes across as a bit of, ad hoc tweak.

203
00:32:34.350 --> 00:32:41.929
Dustin: That's not otherwise well justified. So, kind of, I suppose, low risk, but also low reward on that one.

204
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.809
Dustin: We're not strongly against.

205
00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:44.730
Dustin: Alright.

206
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.860
stokes: Okay, thanks. That was a nice overview.

207
00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:59.279
stokes: Okay, Teku. I actually haven't had time to look at this, because I think it just came right at the start of the call.

208
00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.229
stokes: But would someone from TechU, like, to walk us through?

209
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:12.539
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, we just posted it, so let's start with the fossil,

210
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:17.800
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We think that… we acknowledge the fact that the fossil introduced

211
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:24.590
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Fair amount to complexity, and will probably slow down, the fork.

212
00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:35.670
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But we also see, that this is really the time to consider it and, try to accumulate the timeline, accordingly, and, and,

213
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.329
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Try our best to… to put it in.

214
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.969
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So we are in favor of it.

215
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:49.930
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The other one, which we are in favor, is AT45.

216
00:33:50.540 --> 00:33:51.880
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Simply because it's…

217
00:33:52.180 --> 00:34:00.300
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): pretty… a tiny change that makes sense to… to fix. And, we, have a low…

218
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:06.550
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): low support for progressive containers, just because it's been…

219
00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.800
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): There for a long time, even if the,

220
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:17.240
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We have an implementation for stable containers, but we haven't looked into

221
00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:33.569
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): What needs to be updated for implementing progressive containers, so it will be a little bit of work for us to be evaluated, but if the community wants that, maybe we can consider this.

222
00:34:33.830 --> 00:34:40.509
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And we are also mildly, considering, AD.

223
00:34:40.770 --> 00:34:43.259
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): 61, the churn limit.

224
00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:48.359
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Definitely because the… the user experience

225
00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:54.789
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Should be improved, for sure. And we are kind of natural on the other ones,

226
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:59.879
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We don't have strong opinions, for… for the…

227
00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.679
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): 72 and 68, for instance, which…

228
00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:09.539
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Are very tied to, fast finality things.

229
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:17.540
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And we don't have a… proper… Idea of the…

230
00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:22.510
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The timelines, and how quickly these things do… needs to be done.

231
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.000
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): That's us.

232
00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:27.829
stokes: Oh yeah, thanks.

233
00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:40.409
stokes: And then, Salius here with Grandine has chimed in. Salius, I see you here on the call. Would you like to speak to your comment?

234
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:53.540
saulius: Yeah, the short, comment. So, so we really like, this, short cycles of, hot works, and because, now, we, we are

235
00:35:53.670 --> 00:36:07.450
saulius: quite far from EPBS DevNet Zero, we would come with maybe not very popular opinion that cut everything and just leave EPBS,

236
00:36:08.490 --> 00:36:20.570
saulius: Because that will be the fastest way to ship EPBS, which, as I said, it's a bit… even DevNets now are a bit far away. So that's our opinion.

237
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.450
stokes: Alright, thank you.

238
00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:37.750
stokes: And let me make one more pass over the agenda. So, those were the client teams here, and then otherwise. There were a number of other comments.

239
00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:48.770
stokes: again, yeah, let me just go in order. So, first up I see here, the Stakers Union, they basically are here strongly supporting, fossil.

240
00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:52.729
stokes: There's a comment on the agenda if you'd like to see more about that.

241
00:36:53.290 --> 00:37:00.170
stokes: Next up, Caspar here from the rig team gave the rigs, the rig team's view on this.

242
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:10.519
stokes: again, yeah, let me just mention that, and then I'll give any of these people a chance to briefly speak once I've gone through the agenda.

243
00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:14.940
stokes: So, again, call out here to the rig view.

244
00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:25.940
stokes: There's quite a bit of back and forth here on these different staking EIPs that we've been touching on. We'll probably get into that later in the call.

245
00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:37.759
stokes: And next, we have, Diva here, one of these, staking pools that was mentioned. Again, they're saying yes to 7688.

246
00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:48.870
stokes: This SEZ change helps, yeah, basically all of the staking pool constructions that are, you know, in any sense decentralized, just because the reason about consensus on-chain.

247
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:52.429
stokes: And, yeah, Betty AP's good for that.

248
00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:02.200
stokes: Let me see what else is here. Okay, I think that was more or less it, in terms of views for scoping.

249
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:11.329
stokes: Would any one of the people I just mentioned that are here like to say something briefly about their view, or how they're thinking about the scope?

250
00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:25.840
stokes: Okay, then we'll leave that there.

251
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:31.009
stokes: And… yeah, so Sophia has a comment here, which brings us to…

252
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:38.050
stokes: what I think, you know, it sounds like this is, you know, one of the big questions that we need to decide, so…

253
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:44.579
stokes: It sounds like there's, you know, some support for Fossil, maybe some teams lean against.

254
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:51.570
stokes: And I think, again, this comes down to thinking about scoping, and the fork, and how we went to actually pull this off.

255
00:38:52.030 --> 00:39:00.980
stokes: So… Yeah, would anyone like to present any views to, Fossil itself?

256
00:39:02.170 --> 00:39:08.499
stokes: I would have a suggestion myself for how to move forward, but yeah, maybe first we'll hear different,

257
00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:10.610
stokes: Either arguments, or…

258
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:18.940
stokes: yeah, comments supporting or not supporting Fossil and Amsterdam. And maybe before we jump into things.

259
00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:27.290
stokes: Even if we say no to fossil today, that doesn't mean it can't go into a later fork. So we're not saying no to the entire idea or the EIP.

260
00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.240
stokes: Facebook?

261
00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:44.690
soispoke: Yeah, thanks. I mean, yeah, my comment was gonna be mainly about this, because I've seen your post, and I think there was an opinion that was shared also by some other people that, you know, we can…

262
00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:53.379
soispoke: like, GF5 also, but then maybe include it in HTAR. And my take is that we… I don't really think, like.

263
00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:59.129
soispoke: anyone can rely on statements about the next fork. Like, for me, it's really obvious that

264
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:10.670
soispoke: a lot more unpredictable information will come in, over the next year, and it's just, like, impossible to say how things will turn out, and… or whether, like, Fossil can be included in the H-star fork.

265
00:40:10.990 --> 00:40:22.759
soispoke: Yeah, I think, you know, I think in your post, you also say there is no social risk for fossil, like, I actually disagree, but more importantly, I just think, basically, we don't know, so we…

266
00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:26.119
soispoke: Yeah, I wanted to make a comment about that.

267
00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:35.999
soispoke: And to me, like, in some ways, like, saying, no, we'll DFI for still now, but, we can include it in the next poll feels like…

268
00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:46.710
soispoke: sometimes, like, a way to just, like, DFI for Sol without, like, causing too much discontent amongst, like, the community and core devs that have been pushing for this, so…

269
00:40:46.900 --> 00:41:04.529
soispoke: I did want to mention that, because I don't want it to be the case. I don't want to be like, yeah, sure, we'll include it next forth, and we all know, like, we have no idea whether it will be included, but… and sort of, like, use it as a pretext to just, like, push it back further.

270
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:11.619
soispoke: And… yeah, I think, if I understand correctly, like, the main pushback against Fossil has been around…

271
00:41:12.010 --> 00:41:19.810
soispoke: fork cadence and fork scope, and complexity, which are all, like, valid arguments.

272
00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:38.120
soispoke: And I know we are, like, in this sort of new meta, that prioritizes, like, 6-month forks above, like, everything else, including… I guess including, like, shipping features that drastically improves, like, some of the protocol's resilience and properties.

273
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:49.229
soispoke: I… I feel like, in the end, it's pretty straightforward, like, either we do things for cadence, it's basically, like, the most important thing we should optimize for, including

274
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:59.269
soispoke: Yeah, and that is just, like, basically more important than shipping protocol upgrades that preserve some of the core properties and values Ethereum stands for.

275
00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:13.720
soispoke: or we decide to, yeah, basically SFI both fossil and other EIPs we consider crucial for the future of the protocol, and we accept that this may delay the fall by a few months.

276
00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:23.820
soispoke: But what we shouldn't do, basically, is, like, make statements about HSTAR to justify DeFi Infosool, or any other AIP, basically. So, yeah, that was my feedback.

277
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:39.720
stokes: Okay, thanks. And maybe just for context, yeah, so I do think one path forward here, given, you know, all the considerations and the mixed support that we have today, is just say yes, like, fossil is very important.

278
00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:51.870
stokes: At the same time, there just isn't room for it right now in Clampsterdam, and the proposal then would be to basically, you know, only have EPBS and a small number of other of these CLEIPs.

279
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:56.049
stokes: in Gloucester Dam, and essentially move Fossil then to Hecca.

280
00:42:56.790 --> 00:43:05.550
stokes: I think, you know, the biggest pushback to that is saying, hey, like, so I spoke with Zane, essentially, like, it's really hard to make commitments about multiple forks.

281
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:15.550
stokes: I hear that. I also think, you know, a lot of us here will be the ones determining this, and so if we just all agree to it, I don't see…

282
00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.090
stokes: what the issue would be, but…

283
00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:21.579
stokes: In any case, we can keep talking about this.

284
00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:23.340
stokes: Barnabe.

285
00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:31.139
Barnabé Monnot: Yeah, hi. Well, I wanted to point out two things. The first thing is that

286
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:48.409
Barnabé Monnot: the cost of delaying the fork, by, let's say, 4 months, adding proceed to the scope is not just, like, 4 months delay, it's also losing out on the massive benefit that we're getting from the other features that Glamsterdam is supposed to ship.

287
00:43:48.430 --> 00:43:55.889
Barnabé Monnot: For these extra 4 months. I think Ryan made the point earlier that, yeah, there's a time component that I think is pretty, pretty cool here.

288
00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:03.639
Barnabé Monnot: The second thing I would want to point out is that some of our top researchers, some of our top testing people, some of our top

289
00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:08.169
Barnabé Monnot: Ops and deployment teams are all thinking that this is just…

290
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:21.479
Barnabé Monnot: impossible complexity to manage. Not impossible, of course, but just compounding and explosive complexity, and that it's a mistake to add it to the scope, and I think this signal also needs to be heard.

291
00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:26.210
stokes: Yeah, good point.

292
00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:38.520
stokes: I do think our top priority here should be the security of the protocol, and again, just adding more to the scope does increase the risk of a hard fork. Every EIP adds risk.

293
00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:44.770
stokes: So I do think on, you know, in that framing, we should lean towards less rather than more.

294
00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:46.639
stokes: What's her?

295
00:44:48.600 --> 00:45:00.720
Lodestar Team: Yeah, so we, we also feel strongly in, in concert with both what Barnaby was saying and what with, Thomas was saying, is that…

296
00:45:00.870 --> 00:45:16.529
Lodestar Team: There is an importance to the cadence and being able to ship and deliver and realize these features, and the complexity is high, but the pressure in order to basically force things into the current fork

297
00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:27.339
Lodestar Team: Because of that risk that was spoken about of, like, is it a… is it a secret DFI, is real. And we've seen it happen a number of times in the past.

298
00:45:27.340 --> 00:45:47.190
Lodestar Team: And this is where I think the idea of we should really start thinking about N plus 1 and N plus 2. Like, we, you know, planning as far as your nose is out in front of you is great for some things, but this is, the increasing complexity of being able to

299
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:57.209
Lodestar Team: Not only schedule, development effort and being able to do research planning from a client team perspective, but also from a research perspective.

300
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:11.169
Lodestar Team: So being able to say that, you know, we are going to push it to the next fork, and if there is firm guarantees, like, there is no things that change that, other than, literally, the research says it doesn't break.

301
00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:26.169
Lodestar Team: You know, that… that is a great way in order to create a more predictable cadence, which I think would benefit not only the development effort, but the predictability

302
00:46:26.170 --> 00:46:34.199
Lodestar Team: For those in the industry and the market in order to understand what, what features are on the horizon.

303
00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.180
stokes: Kevin Pendops.

304
00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:54.369
kev and pandaops: Yeah, I think we also want to preface with, we really like Fossil as an EIP, and we definitely intend and want to ship it, and we are more than happy to help with whatever that requires.

305
00:46:54.370 --> 00:47:02.890
kev and pandaops: Our main, issue is that we don't want to repeat the same mistakes we did with Pectra. We over-scoped, and then we decided to

306
00:47:02.890 --> 00:47:11.400
kev and pandaops: Split stuff up later, way too late, and it led to an insanely long fork that also felt way riskier, because we made changes mid-flight.

307
00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:19.459
kev and pandaops: One of my biggest fears with Fossil, as well as EPBS, is that they change a lot of the same parts of the system.

308
00:47:19.590 --> 00:47:26.349
kev and pandaops: Which means you cannot often make a change to EPBS without thinking about how this affects everything with Fossil.

309
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:34.549
kev and pandaops: Same problem exists with, networking. Like Dustin said, same problem exists with testing. We can't test anything in isolation.

310
00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:46.410
kev and pandaops: One of the benefits of sequencing forks such that we change one part of Ethereum once at a time, is that you can be quite sure that the changes are tested. It's how we're also doing Fusaka.

311
00:47:46.460 --> 00:48:00.199
kev and pandaops: we're not doing any other networking changes. We could have shipped blob scaling along with Fusaka, but we decided to de-risk it by doing BPOs after. That gave us a lot more confidence on it. I think for that reason, I would…

312
00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:18.640
kev and pandaops: prefer if we are doing fossil as a fork after. And I do agree that it's hard to give commitments on what the fork after looks. However, we have done this at least twice in the past. We committed to withdrawals before the merge was shipped. We've committed to Pierdas before Pectra was shipped.

313
00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:32.070
kev and pandaops: So, I don't think that we… we do have some counter examples, of course, with EOF and Worker, but we also have pro examples. We can sometimes commit to a feature, not just the immediate fork, but two forks out.

314
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:37.090
kev and pandaops: I also think that if we want predictable cadence and timelines, we're not going to be able to

315
00:48:37.090 --> 00:49:00.650
kev and pandaops: finish a fork and only then start preparing what the next fork is going to be. We're going to have to do some amount of pipelining, which means you can start with medium confidence that Fossil will be in, not, not in Glamsterdam, but in Hitstar, and unless there's contradictory evidence presented over the next year, that that is what happens, but the point of the next few months is to find those contradictory evidence, right?

316
00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:05.259
kev and pandaops: So yeah, I think our case is that if we want to keep testing

317
00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:13.910
kev and pandaops: Scoped, if you want to have, faster timelines, if you want to actually have parallel forks, we should try to keep scope as small as possible.

318
00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.160
stokes: Guess what?

319
00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:36.499
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: Yeah, so I think, also kind of echoing some things that were said in the chat, but I think one of the main worries about Fossil not being included in Glamsterdam is that it will suffer a similar kind of conversation in Hecca and the next fog.

320
00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:44.989
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: like, in particular, shorter slots in fossil, both being CL changes, and then the worry being that,

321
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:50.299
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: For similar arguments regarding, fork cadence and, and kind of…

322
00:49:50.510 --> 00:50:05.639
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: complexity that it would then be dropped again. And so I guess one question here is how, like, why do we think it will be different, and how can we kind of, is there, like, a serious attempt that the governance process can make to

323
00:50:05.750 --> 00:50:10.559
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: for, like, a credible commitment, for Fossil being prioritized in HECA.

324
00:50:10.690 --> 00:50:17.849
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: Over other changes, if necessary. And yeah, so I guess, I think.

325
00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:24.450
Caspar Schwarz-Schilling: that is a key kind of question for… or worry about fossil in Amsterdam or not.

326
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:42.549
Lodestar Team: And I think this is exactly what I'm talking about, planning out further than the single fork, is that we all know 6-second slots is a priority, and we all know it's gonna be something that's gonna be important, and before we make the decision on whether FOSIL is now or next fork.

327
00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:48.650
Lodestar Team: Like, being able to say what is the priority of the 6 seconds loss versus fossil is important.

328
00:50:48.650 --> 00:51:08.050
Lodestar Team: Because that will eventually be coming up in the next fork, and being able to advocate every single fork just beats down the person who is the advocate for an EIP. Like, there needs to be some surety for the person, just like… just like POTUS has been pushing for years on EPBS.

329
00:51:08.050 --> 00:51:24.779
Lodestar Team: it's a grind. And just like, Virkle was pushed on by Guillaume for years, it's a grind. And this is the part of that surety of looking out at a roadmap style with a couple forks ahead, with surety.

330
00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:40.549
Lodestar Team: Like, we will do this in two forks, and there is no delay of that. Short of a security bug, like, to me, this is a critically important piece to creating the longevity to the dev process that we all would like to see for Ethereum.

331
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:43.720
stokes: Metallic.

332
00:51:46.420 --> 00:52:04.359
vitalik: Yeah, hello guys. Yeah, I think, one thing that's just important to keep in mind that I think now, quite a few people have, kind of hinted at, right, is that, Ethereum is, not just a technical system, it's,

333
00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.110
vitalik: Also a social system. And so, if,

334
00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:16.270
vitalik: we have goals, that we, care about. We, need to continually make them clear to…

335
00:52:16.410 --> 00:52:33.259
vitalik: I mean, our community and even ourselves, not just by, yeah, but by speaking, but also by taking action, right? And, I think, like, to me, that would be the, like, that's one of the stronger cases for…

336
00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.600
vitalik: Either, like, making some type of commitment to

337
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:47.939
vitalik: fossil, which, I think, you know, there was, a good point made, right, which is, that, it's, like, it could happen in,

338
00:52:47.940 --> 00:53:05.960
vitalik: in the next fork, or it ha- it happened… it being top priority, and I think, I would say, yeah, explicitly above 6 seconds in priority in the, in the fork… in the fork after that, right? Because, there is, like, I think there is,

339
00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:18.659
vitalik: An actual risk that's, basically, you know, if the community perceives us as continually, delaying certain kinds of things, but,

340
00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:32.760
vitalik: But then prioritizing efficiency upgrades, then that's, like, a pattern that will perpetuate itself, and so I think it's, like, it's good to think about, you know, how,

341
00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:36.549
vitalik: Like… Basically, yeah, even…

342
00:53:36.830 --> 00:53:48.959
vitalik: Just for the… for… for that reason alone, making sure we have at least some density of, changes happening that are directed, toward goals like,

343
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:56.869
vitalik: Censorship resistance and decentralization, and, you know, being able to say things like, okay, you know, we've done,

344
00:53:57.130 --> 00:54:02.929
vitalik: Scale-related life related things for the last three. And,

345
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:12.589
vitalik: we need to go in the… in some different direction for this one, right? So, like, my view is, that, like, we… we need to…

346
00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:19.259
vitalik: be willing to make commitments, that, last, not that…

347
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:30.129
vitalik: that go further out than one fork, and that at the same time are not absolute, but that are also… also meaningful. And,

348
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:37.209
vitalik: And this is, like, the… yeah, like, I don't think there's,

349
00:54:38.030 --> 00:54:50.419
vitalik: in any one particular format, that's the, only way of, of doing it, but I think we do need to have an answer for people who will, ask, well, like, basically, yeah, you know, like, when,

350
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.660
vitalik: If there's strong agreement that something is, is valuable, then when is it getting included?

351
00:55:00.570 --> 00:55:03.040
stokes: Yeah, that's helpful context, thanks.

352
00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:05.149
stokes: Sophia.

353
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:21.829
Sophia Gold: Yeah, I want to give a ZK EVM perspective. This is my opinion, not a team opinion. So, at the same time, I would like to see EPBS as soon as possible, because we need the, pipelining… the attestation pipelining.

354
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:26.059
Sophia Gold: to launch an optional, ZKEA tester client.

355
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:33.600
Sophia Gold: But also, I would be concerned if, a fossil is delayed past, the H fork.

356
00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:38.979
Sophia Gold: And the reason is that I see Fossil as actually part of our scaling roadmap.

357
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:51.580
Sophia Gold: I think that, you know, we need it for censorship resistance by the time we are setting the gas limit based on proving benchmarks, rather than execution benchmarks with the current validator hardware.

358
00:55:51.670 --> 00:56:01.540
Sophia Gold: Because, you know, I think with multiple proofs that we need for security, I don't see the possibility of,

359
00:56:01.990 --> 00:56:19.379
Sophia Gold: building… generating all those proofs with, like, a single GPU, so it will change that… that landscape. And, my most optimistic timeline of that happening would be mid-2027. Again, that's… I think that's quite optimistic, but, if you…

360
00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:27.959
Sophia Gold: factor that… project out, factor that in, and the possibility of fork delays, I would be concerned if fossil… that that fossil would

361
00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:32.080
Sophia Gold: could possibly block that if it's bunked out of the HFERG.

362
00:56:32.290 --> 00:56:36.760
Sophia Gold: So, I am skept… I am sympathetic to people who are skeptical of,

363
00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:54.249
Sophia Gold: commitments that go out beyond, the next work, but, I think it would be ideal if we found a way to do that more credibly, by pipelining the work and setting, some types of deadlines for it, while people were working on Glamsterdam.

364
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.540
stokes: Okay, thanks.

365
00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.599
stokes: Any other… Present comments?

366
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:16.119
stokes: Okay, so let me try to play this all back.

367
00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:24.839
stokes: it sounds like people, I think, mostly are okay with…

368
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.650
stokes: doing something like Fossil and HECA.

369
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:30.550
stokes: If we have a way to credibly commit to it.

370
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:38.379
stokes: And this, yeah, keeps cluster temps small, means we can get it out the door sooner, means we can get to ECA sooner, means we can get to Fossil sooner.

371
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:49.090
stokes: there is also this point of, like, thinking about HECA and, like, how we'd actually make that commitment, because then, you know, we get to, okay, do we do 6 seconds less, do we do a fossil?

372
00:57:49.990 --> 00:58:00.600
stokes: I think given the overwhelming support for it today, you know, it seems like that would be the case, that we would do Fossil. I really don't see what would change, in Hecca.

373
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:05.850
stokes: So, that's what I would propose as the path forward on this one.

374
00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:10.619
stokes: Then the question is, how do we credibly commit to it?

375
00:58:11.410 --> 00:58:13.319
stokes: I'm open to ideas.

376
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:21.290
stokes: one would even be going ahead and SFI fossil for HECA. The meta-EIP.

377
00:58:21.570 --> 00:58:23.080
stokes: Is on the way.

378
00:58:23.370 --> 00:58:24.729
stokes: So we could just do that.

379
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:35.110
stokes: We could do something lighter weight. We could say, you know, even just essentially have the message from this call today, hey, poor devs, you know, unilaterally support Fossil and HECA.

380
00:58:35.690 --> 00:58:38.789
stokes: I assume unilaterally. It sounds like it's unilateral?

381
00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:43.460
stokes: But in any case, basically say, hey, this is definitely happening.

382
00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:50.030
stokes: And, ultimately, people just take us at our word. And the reason they can do that is because, yeah, you know, I think…

383
00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:55.030
stokes: The sentiment today, the people today, will still be here for the most part.

384
00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:07.169
stokes: After Amsterdam, we can have the same views, we'll bring this into Hecca, and again, I would be very surprised if we have this commitment today and don't get too fossil in Hecca.

385
00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:22.920
Lodestar Team: I think the part that we stand is that it's not so much you say it's hard to say we would, it's a commitment. And that's the part that I think if we could get there.

386
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:25.179
Lodestar Team: Is great.

387
00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:32.000
stokes: Right.

388
00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.950
stokes: So, yeah, do you have any thoughts then? Like, should we SFI?

389
00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:45.810
stokes: Mixer here on the comment, basically taking another… yeah, either trying to touch on this during next week's ACD, or just go to next ACDC.

390
00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:48.269
stokes: And find the right way to do this.

391
00:59:49.550 --> 00:59:49.929
Lodestar Team: I mean.

392
00:59:49.930 --> 00:59:50.550
stokes: Okay, what's happening?

393
00:59:51.100 --> 00:59:56.379
Lodestar Team: it doesn't feel out of bounds to say it's SFI'd, it's the headliner, next one, and…

394
00:59:56.470 --> 01:00:11.259
Lodestar Team: to build those… those chops of being able to do cadence, like, quick cadence, because it gives the client teams a surety of… and I think part of the thing with ePBS is that

395
01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:19.469
Lodestar Team: Because it took us… and granted, it's a maturation of the process, so it's not to discount the process, but…

396
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:29.119
Lodestar Team: if we had that SFI guarantee sooner, it gives more credence and more weight to it, and then as a… as a person trying to schedule

397
01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:40.270
Lodestar Team: resources to work on these things, it gives more weight to, we need to actually start focusing and driving this. And being able to do that SFI for H,

398
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:52.290
Lodestar Team: also brings forth that same, that same importance and that same weight to make sure age is ready when we really want to, and I think that will help to drive the cadence to a shorter.

399
01:00:52.290 --> 01:01:01.229
Lodestar Team: time frame, and I think it will also build more of a… of an organizational commitment to being able to ship faster in smaller chunks.

400
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:04.750
stokes: Boris?

401
01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:17.910
Potuz: So, I am one of the ones that want to see fossil in. I consider it much more important than 6-second slots. However, I don't think we can SFI this for the H fork at all.

402
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:29.870
Potuz: Because otherwise, we would want to have the discussion of what is the headliner, and we would really want to have the people involved that are advocating for 6-second slots, and have that discussion for the headliner of the aged pork.

403
01:01:29.870 --> 01:01:35.070
Potuz: Now, which sounds already another Pandora's box.

404
01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:52.029
Potuz: I am perfectly fine if we do a strong… if we find, as Nixa said, one way of making it so that it's actually a credible commitment to CFI it. Sfi it is kind of crazy, unless we have that, discussion right now about 6-second slots.

405
01:01:54.920 --> 01:02:09.240
kev and pandaops: Maybe to build on that, maybe the other way of looking at it is that if we decide to SFI Fossil for Headstar, then that is something that the 6-second slots crowd has to deal with at the, fork scoping process for Headstar.

406
01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:21.590
kev and pandaops: As in, we enter the fork scoping process, assuming 6-second slots is SFI'd… sorry, fossil is SFI'd, and any consideration would take fossil as… at higher priority than anything else.

407
01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:27.620
stokes: Yeah, so I spoke.

408
01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:40.539
soispoke: Yeah, I feel… I mean, I understand, like, the sort of, like, worry about, like, not having a headliner process for HECA or something like this, because you wouldn't have discussions, but, like, the fact is, like.

409
01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:45.190
soispoke: You know, discussions around fossil have, like, happened already.

410
01:02:45.200 --> 01:03:03.139
soispoke: like, a lot, and we've asked feedback from the community many times, and they've expressed it in, like, many, many different ways, on It Magicians, on Twitter, or, like, doing the tier list, and, like, all of this has happened, not only for the headliner process, now for the

411
01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:18.119
soispoke: you know, PFI'd EIPs, like, I think, like, yeah, in a way, you can't, like, ask the people to just, like, come in every year, advocate for the same thing again and again, like, it doesn't really feel fair either.

412
01:03:22.190 --> 01:03:24.290
stokes: Kevin Penhops, was your hand slow?

413
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:28.070
kev and pandaops: Sorry, that was a mistake.

414
01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:29.110
stokes: Okay, okay.

415
01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.330
stokes: I don'.

416
01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:47.190
Lodestar Team: I do think that's a really good point, is that that's the part of, like, re-advocating, re-advocating, re-advocating. If there's a decision made, it's easy. You know, you say that it's SFI'd, and if we can also do 6-second slots.

417
01:03:47.190 --> 01:03:57.830
Lodestar Team: It's awesome, but that becomes the same discussion we had today for Fosel. It's like, we think EPBS is the headliner, or it is the headliner. Can we fit Fosel in?

418
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:02.369
Lodestar Team: Well, maybe not, so we can push it back to the next one, but then…

419
01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:27.359
Lodestar Team: well, can we fit in 6-second slots? Maybe not. We could put it to the next one. And with that kind of a process where we're doing longer-term thinking of how many forks out, and sticking to it, is the part that I think is the piece that was missing before, is that you had to re-advocate, re-advocate. You now can start even to think about even shorter than 6 months, and I know that's very aggressive.

420
01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:43.490
Lodestar Team: and ambitious, but if you're working on very small chunks in parallel, it's much easier to plan for team resources and do the actual development to maintain an even faster cadence than I think we even appreciate today.

421
01:04:50.530 --> 01:04:51.980
stokes: Okay, thanks.

422
01:04:52.730 --> 01:05:02.079
stokes: So, there are a number of comments in the chat around, yeah, basically not, like, coming up with some way to do this on this call, which I think is fair.

423
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:09.640
stokes: Then in terms of moving forward, I think what we should do is take all this contact for Fossil.

424
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:18.389
stokes: I think this is an interesting direction to explore of how we would, you know, find the best way to credibly commit to fossil and HECA.

425
01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:32.630
stokes: I think, yeah, we should probably just go ahead and do that on the next ACDC, so that would give everyone 2 weeks to think a bit, see how this sits. You know, there's a couple different options. I can propose some things.

426
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.879
stokes: That could look like, you know.

427
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:50.909
stokes: That could look like putting it as SFI'd on the meta-EIP that kind of sidesteps the headliner process, as some other people pointed out in the chat, which I think is fair. It could be something like a PR that's not merged that basically does SFI for Fossil for HECA.

428
01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.430
stokes: it could look like something else. So, there are some options here.

429
01:05:54.810 --> 01:05:59.060
stokes: And… yeah, I think that'd be a nice way forward.

430
01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:08.349
stokes: That also lets us move to the other EIPs that we should touch on today with the time we have left, which I think, yeah, is, like, about 30 minutes.

431
01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.919
stokes: So… Does that sound good to everyone?

432
01:06:17.410 --> 01:06:18.830
stokes: So, essentially, yeah.

433
01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:24.589
stokes: keep all this context in mind for Fossil. Let's try to find a way to think about how to get it into ECA.

434
01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:33.140
stokes: we'll sort that out two weeks from today on the next ACDC, and then we'll move forward with the other EIPs today.

435
01:06:40.290 --> 01:06:42.000
stokes: Okay, then let's do that.

436
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:46.710
stokes: Then in that case, let's turn to the other EIPs.

437
01:06:48.370 --> 01:06:54.110
stokes: Sorry, I saw this comment here from Kingi for delaying fossil… Okay.

438
01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:57.000
stokes: And I guess the other thing is, you know.

439
01:06:57.210 --> 01:07:05.080
stokes: team should, or they may want to revisit some of their views today, if we do move Fossil to HECA. So, yeah, I think in any case.

440
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:08.780
stokes: We'll need another call to get to the final sales scope for Amsterdam.

441
01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:19.299
stokes: Yeah, Casper's basically just following up on this. So, I think we can still make progress on the other IPs, I think there were just some general questions about them.

442
01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.190
stokes: So we could touch on those today.

443
01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:29.660
stokes: Yeah, again, we can think more about it and do this, because I agree.

444
01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:36.649
stokes: What it implies, then, is maybe a client team needs to have, like, two versions, basically, which maybe is more work than they want to do.

445
01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:38.140
stokes: I'm not sure.

446
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:47.060
stokes: But in any case, let's get into the other EIPs. So yeah, again, thank you everyone. As you can see, there are many considerations here.

447
01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:52.049
stokes: fossil, and what it sort of really stands for is very important to Ethereum.

448
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.929
stokes: But there's a lot of things to fit together here.

449
01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:01.710
stokes: So, let's look at the other EIPs, and…

450
01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.530
stokes: Yeah, I'm not sure how we want to go about this.

451
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:15.440
stokes: again, because these kind of came in late, I haven't had a time… I haven't had time to get a clear view of exactly where people stand.

452
01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:24.819
stokes: Maybe we'll sort of go in parallel to the EL, where they're trying to come to consensus on some kind of EFI set.

453
01:08:25.250 --> 01:08:33.139
stokes: And it seems like there's the least support for something like 8068. I don't know if anyone would like to speak to that EAP.

454
01:08:43.770 --> 01:08:49.260
stokes: I could also frame it as support for 8068. This is the one that changes the effective balances line a bit.

455
01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:52.610
stokes: And I believe the intent is to make it, essentially.

456
01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.010
stokes: Have, like, a more even playing ground between 01 and 02 validators.

457
01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:02.290
stokes: I think it also ties into some of these other EIPs. So, yeah, Anders.

458
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:13.429
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, I can just say that, yeah, exactly as you said. So… so that was what it does, but if it's too complex, there's also this,

459
01:09:14.119 --> 01:09:20.619
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, so there's an interaction, essentially, between 8068 and 8062, so we're… Yep.

460
01:09:20.779 --> 01:09:24.379
Anders Elowsson: Thinking about if we can sort of,

461
01:09:25.309 --> 01:09:31.959
Anders Elowsson: Compensate for the, you know, the lower… the lower yield that you get on a…

462
01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:48.109
Anders Elowsson: compounding validators if you have a lower balance, because you lose out on that 0.75 ETH that you're not getting any return on investment on. By instead raising the fee on 8062,

463
01:09:48.109 --> 01:09:54.739
Anders Elowsson: So we don't do 80-68, but we have 80-62, which is a slightly stronger fee.

464
01:09:55.429 --> 01:10:08.979
Anders Elowsson: So, and I can also flag that there's… there's in 8268, there's an alternative specification where we, just remove this way for people to partially withdraw down to

465
01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:22.419
Anders Elowsson: Right now, you can partially withdraw down to 32.75 ETH, but still getting 33 ETH of, effective balance, so you can get, like, a high return on your investment by keeping your stake very low.

466
01:10:22.599 --> 01:10:29.709
Anders Elowsson: On a compounding validator, so there's this option to just do that as well.

467
01:10:29.849 --> 01:10:36.109
Anders Elowsson: But anyway, I see that the complexity of 8068, it seems like there's, like.

468
01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:45.019
Anders Elowsson: To do the whole thing where you change the, you know, the affected balance bands, it seems like it might be off the…

469
01:10:45.699 --> 01:10:51.399
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, out of scope, as it seems. I don't know. I'm not sure about how people feel about it.

470
01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:53.220
stokes: Agree.

471
01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:56.039
stokes: Let's see, was it POTUS and then Greg?

472
01:10:56.980 --> 01:11:09.839
Potuz: Yeah, so I've learned something when speccing EPBS, and it's to talk to the teams that are going to be affected, and even though they're always… they might never change their mind.

473
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:26.160
Potuz: In this particular case, I suspect, and I strongly suspect, that it doesn't matter which of the two we implement, we're not going to see much effect on consolidations until much later. This is… the reason why we aren't seeing consolidations on holds

474
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:41.910
Potuz: It's because it comes at a cost. It comes at a big cost. They need to change on-chain contracts, they need to audit these contracts, they take… that takes time. Perhaps even, like, pressure from the community would be more effective than having these CIPs that would just punish books.

475
01:11:42.990 --> 01:11:57.309
Potuz: both of these CIPs would punish them in a way. One with complexity for us, the other one with actual, like, money, like, charging them. And I see that the benefits is going to be very minor, because

476
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:04.600
Potuz: I don't expect them to change their contract to audit the contracts and do this just faster, because we just shipped the CIPs.

477
01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:13.790
Anders Elowsson: So you… can I just chime in? So you're saying that you think that all these,

478
01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:21.390
Anders Elowsson: you know, node operators living on 32-it validators will consolidate, even without some

479
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:34.609
Anders Elowsson: some small… small incentive or not, because when I hear arguments, I hear that some argue against it because they do not want to consolidate, and they never want to consolidate. So that's something I would like to understand.

480
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:37.389
Potuz: Homestakers did consolidate quickly.

481
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:51.569
Potuz: pools didn't, and I strongly suspect that once we see, CSM, for example, supporting X02 validators, we are going to start seeing more. I, myself, would start validating again

482
01:12:51.570 --> 01:13:00.429
Potuz: If that happens. So I suspect that we just need support from pools, and if there's no support from pools, then, well, it's harder to see consolidations.

483
01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.300
stokes: Greg, do you have a comment?

484
01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:24.560
Greg K | Lido: Yeah, so from, later side, I think that, this, adding a fee, like, 862, is not fair, because it's, kind of penalizing type 1 validators, and, like, if the incentive is to just.

485
01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:41.629
Greg K | Lido: If the goal is to just incentivize consolidating to 002, then, the way to do it is to provide incentives for that. So, like, improved effective balance calculation, like 8068 is much more effective, in my opinion.

486
01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:47.070
Greg K | Lido: And yeah, from the LIDAR side, LiDAR is working towards having

487
01:13:47.160 --> 01:14:02.210
Greg K | Lido: all permissioned operators, like, in 2026, consolidating to 002 anyway, so this is, like, none… even if none of those EIPs come, like, there's committed in, user consolidations.

488
01:14:02.540 --> 01:14:15.709
Greg K | Lido: on 90%, perhaps, of the stake, and the remaining 10% is, like, the goal is the 10% to go to the CSM, to the permissionless, trustless staking. And for this one, we need 001 validators.

489
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:24.430
Greg K | Lido: So we think that, it's unfair having a penalty, because, you know, we have this fixed bond requirement, we provide this very cheap

490
01:14:24.530 --> 01:14:29.400
Greg K | Lido: Very low barrier to entry, for also stakeholders.

491
01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:34.860
Greg K | Lido: And, yeah, like, adding some cost for those 01 validators.

492
01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:54.050
Greg K | Lido: Just does not seem fair. And in general, like, the protocol, might… we might end up in a protocol, like, having, like, say, 90% of validators having consolidated, but for the remaining 10% that, for, let's say, necessity, or for any preference, they want to use 01, that should not be penalized, in our opinion.

493
01:14:55.030 --> 01:15:07.049
Greg K | Lido: So we kind of… we don't support, AT62, and if there, if we… we believe, like, if there is some incentive needed to be added, it will be AT68.

494
01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.780
stokes: Okay. Yeah, thanks for the, input.

495
01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:27.650
stokes: So… Okay, I think we can at least, in terms of making progress through the scoping discussion.

496
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:40.300
stokes: it seems like we can go ahead and DFI 8068, and again, I think we'll need another call here, so that maybe, you know, there's things to work through in other EIPs that kind of accomplish some of the same goals.

497
01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:43.359
stokes: But I think we can at least do that today, so…

498
01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:51.699
stokes: I suppose this is a chance for final comments. Otherwise, let's at least leave today with DFI 8068.

499
01:15:53.980 --> 01:16:10.660
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, just a small comment, just so that people are aware about this gaming incentive that you have when you can withdraw down to 32.75 ETH, which can be addressed separately in a… but if people are aware of it, and they don't think it's a concern, then we can deify it, I guess.

500
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:13.580
stokes: Agree.

501
01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:17.099
stokes: So, let's go ahead and do that.

502
01:16:17.970 --> 01:16:21.649
stokes: And we touched on 8062,

503
01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:25.350
stokes: Yeah, I don't know if there's more to say here.

504
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:36.520
stokes: I would probably suggest for now, just in terms of time, that we just take the input from today, and we can keep thinking about it, and we will make a decision on the next call.

505
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:44.640
stokes: Let's try to go through these other…

506
01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:56.270
stokes: staking EIPs, that touch the staking mechanics. So we have 8061 and 8071. So, 8061, this is the IP that, touches various turn limits.

507
01:16:56.540 --> 01:17:08.149
stokes: 8071, this is preventing consolidations as withdrawals, which, patches this, essentially consequence of Petra. So…

508
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:11.259
stokes: Yeah, sure. Kev, Pandops?

509
01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:22.700
kev and pandaops: Hey guys, it's Barnabas. I would really like to actually end the discussion on all the EIPs today and make a decision about everything, including

510
01:17:23.170 --> 01:17:29.719
kev and pandaops: we just made the decision on full sale to basically push it to the next fork, so based on this, I think we could actually…

511
01:17:29.830 --> 01:17:35.330
kev and pandaops: either DFI or SFI, all the remaining CLIPs in today's call.

512
01:17:36.290 --> 01:17:37.460
Potuz: Please know…

513
01:17:40.570 --> 01:17:46.189
stokes: Yeah, I agree, Barnabas, with the spirit, I think, especially given that

514
01:17:46.330 --> 01:17:51.589
stokes: you know, this fossil, the way we want to handle fossil, is possibly somewhat novel.

515
01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:54.490
stokes: I think at least one more call is justified.

516
01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.310
stokes: Okay.

517
01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:05.020
stokes: Any comments on AD61 or 8071? .

518
01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:09.540
Francesco: Yeah, I mean, I can just say…

519
01:18:09.540 --> 01:18:10.940
stokes: work soon. Oh, sure.

520
01:18:11.370 --> 01:18:27.290
Francesco: Maybe, yeah, just, about 8061, one thing is, like, I… I think I presented it maybe 2 weeks ago, and one thing that has changed, I don't know if people have seen, but it's that now the activation, limit stays, so there was this concern that people brought up about the…

521
01:18:27.330 --> 01:18:37.470
Francesco: basically, state growth and all those, like, issues kind of getting worse as we increase the activation churn, so I've decided to not,

522
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:54.830
Francesco: have this be… this discussion be part of the AP, so I just decided to keep the cap there. And then another thing is that it introduces this mechanism of, basically, churn sharing between the exit and consolidation queue. And in a way, this makes it also,

523
01:18:54.950 --> 01:19:07.110
Francesco: basically, like, it makes it so that either we should do this or a 71. Like, if we do this, it doesn't make sense to do, 71, because we already basically solved the problem. So, yeah, just that.

524
01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:14.480
Francesco: Obviously, like, 71 is a much, much simpler EIP, but it's also trying to do much less. It's trying just to address

525
01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:26.940
Francesco: this specific kind of issue with the consolidation logic, whereas here, there's all these other things going on that I think we already discussed last time, and I don't know if it's worth now going into again.

526
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:34.490
stokes: I think we're okay about it. But yeah, that was helpful context. So…

527
01:19:34.630 --> 01:19:39.560
stokes: Right, I would be curious then to hear from client teams if they'd had a chance to look at 8061.

528
01:19:39.870 --> 01:19:46.190
stokes: And enough depth to get a sense of, yeah, like, because it sounds like 8061…

529
01:19:46.570 --> 01:19:53.329
stokes: would be superior to 8071, but the concern then would be, you know, it's a much bigger EIP, or at least big enough.

530
01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:59.799
stokes: Do client teams agree with this assessment that 8061 is big enough to have some reservations?

531
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.700
stokes: Potus?

532
01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:12.299
Potuz: So, I would first try to make sure that we want to fix this issue. If we do, then we can argue between these two. If we don't, then we don't need to.

533
01:20:12.430 --> 01:20:22.130
Potuz: I personally believe that we need to fix it, and I believe that 8071 is the wrong way of fixing it, because it's the worst case for everyone.

534
01:20:22.170 --> 01:20:34.069
Potuz: The people that are using this system will stop using this system, because it's unfair, but they're going to start, like, increasing the churn on the actual exit queue, so the people that are being hurt

535
01:20:34.200 --> 01:20:40.730
Potuz: are being unfairly treated by the current system will be even in a worse situation after we put 8071.

536
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.369
Potuz: And,

537
01:20:42.870 --> 01:20:56.699
Potuz: And on top of that, we're not using the churn of consolidations when there aren't consolidations to actually do something useful, which is exits. So, definitely, to me, it sounds like 8061 is the right way of fixing this. The complexity is much higher.

538
01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:02.750
Potuz: But it's not that much higher. I mean, we're already, like, Looking into EPBS?

539
01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:16.329
Potuz: The problem we see with AD61 is that it would be nice to have a formal proof, or some formal treatment about, like, the week's subjectivity period and these kind of concerns.

540
01:21:20.490 --> 01:21:21.250
stokes: Francesco?

541
01:21:22.850 --> 01:21:30.990
Francesco: Yeah, so, I mean, one point is, like, there's a lot of stuff going on in 61 that has nothing to do with fixing the problem that 71 addresses, so…

542
01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:55.980
Francesco: if we're specifically just talking about that problem, we could also just do the thing that 61 does of the churn sharing and forget everything else about 61, which reduces the complexity a lot. And then we can have the rest of the discussion around the churn limits and increasing and so on, and weak subjectivity, like, separately from all of this. Like, I could split it into two EIPs, or it could replace 71, I don't know, just to, like, simplify this discussion and not kind of conflate the two things.

543
01:21:56.260 --> 01:22:07.600
Francesco: And then on the weak subjectivity point, I also, like, I saw this on the issue, and I asked a question, but let me ask it now as well. What I didn't quite understand is, like, is the question about this analysis

544
01:22:07.710 --> 01:22:12.210
Francesco: On what the impact on the week's subjectivity period is, or on, like.

545
01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:17.290
Francesco: Which week's subjectivity period we should be choosing for what reasons, and so on.

546
01:22:17.830 --> 01:22:22.909
Potuz: Yeah, it's rather the second one. I think that the EIP has the correct,

547
01:22:23.060 --> 01:22:24.609
Potuz: Treatment of what is the…

548
01:22:28.230 --> 01:22:35.249
stokes: And just to remind everyone, Francisco, I think with the EAP right now, it gets us down to something like 6 days of exhibitivity.

549
01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.270
Francesco: 7 days.

550
01:22:36.490 --> 01:22:37.609
stokes: 7 News? Okay.

551
01:22:38.330 --> 01:22:39.650
stokes: Okay, so, like, a week.

552
01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:45.409
stokes: Which does mean there are other places where we have 7-day windows like this.

553
01:22:46.080 --> 01:23:04.759
Francesco: And of course, the numbers are, like, I think someone… in some client teams post, there was a concern that the numbers are fixed without having discussed, and of course, I mean, the numbers are… I just put some numbers which look reasonable to me, to get to the… to this one-week number, but, like, we could… we could change it, it could be 10 days, I don't know. Of course, we can start from the,

554
01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:17.159
Francesco: the other side of deciding, like, what is an acceptable weak substitutivity period, and then decide the numbers based on that. So don't treat those as fixed, necessarily. But I don't know how to answer his question of, like, what is a reasonable weak subjectivity period, like…

555
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:20.789
Francesco: I'm not sure exactly, like, how to get to this answer.

556
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:27.230
stokes: Okay.

557
01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:43.549
stokes: Okay, I think that gives us some paths forward on 8061 and 8071. It sounds like there's generally support from everyone to do something here, it's just figuring out what the right something is.

558
01:23:45.810 --> 01:23:54.410
stokes: And… okay. Then, let's turn to 8045. This is the EIP that would exclude slash validators from the proposer sequence.

559
01:23:54.850 --> 01:23:58.730
stokes: Yeah, so I think where this really comes up…

560
01:23:58.940 --> 01:24:13.810
stokes: has been on DevNets or testnets, and it seems like a nice quality-of-life thing, mainly for us in the room. But then the question is, you know, do we need it on mainnet? Will it, like, really substantially improve things on mainnets?

561
01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:21.710
stokes: Again, I haven't had time to get a good pulse of the differing client opinions.

562
01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:26.370
stokes: I think some people were forced, some people were more neutral.

563
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:42.359
stokes: In terms of, you know, so I guess one way to think about this is if we do want to keep the scope as tight as possible, then we'd lean towards the FI, but then, yeah, I'd want to open the floor for people to argue against that.

564
01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:45.140
stokes: Potus?

565
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:49.359
Potuz: I just have one little grudge with DCIP, and…

566
01:24:49.460 --> 01:25:07.779
Potuz: And it's the fact… I haven't really audited our code, but it's the fact that today, when we are going to propose to check who the proposer is, you can grab any state that has the same shuffling and the same active validators as the one that was used to compute the proposers.

567
01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:17.459
Potuz: But DCIP changes this, because you now need to also have the same slash validators, and those can change, intra-epoch.

568
01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:37.639
Potuz: So I think this… this isn't straightforward, as one would really think. It's one of those CIPs, like what happens in Electra, that you see just a one-liner, and then you think it's a one-liner, it might not be. But after the look-ahead in Fusaka, it might be a really minor complaint, so it's not a strong complaint that I have, but I want people to be aware of this change.

569
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:45.770
stokes: Okay. Wouldn't you also know from the same state that if a validator was slashed or not? So it seems like that's fine, right?

570
01:25:45.770 --> 01:26:03.100
Potuz: No, because you need it to be… you need to be… you need to have the slash validators at the time that the look-ahead was computed, which is different than your head state. So, for example, today, when I want to check, who the proposer is, I can just grab a head state. And that would still be the case,

571
01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:22.260
Potuz: after DCIP, because of the look-ahead. But if you, for some reason, need to recompute the proposers, for whatever reason, because you're syncing something from fork, then, we… today, we can grab any state on that fork. It doesn't need to be exactly the one of the epoch transition.

572
01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:36.110
Potuz: If we have at handy one recent state from that fork, we can just use it. We can just grab it from a cache and use it, because we can prove that it has the same shuffling and the same active validators, because those only change on input transitions.

573
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:42.549
Potuz: But, if we add the CIP, this is going to be impossible.

574
01:26:43.090 --> 01:26:43.760
Potuz: Yep.

575
01:26:46.110 --> 01:26:51.799
stokes: Okay, and the claim is that it's that much worse? Like, it's actually… it would actually be an issue here?

576
01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.939
Potuz: Performance or something. No, I think that it's minor.

577
01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:54.970
stokes: Okay.

578
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:56.390
stokes: Okay.

579
01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.649
stokes: That's a good call, then.

580
01:27:00.990 --> 01:27:04.300
kev and pandaops: Is it still a minor issue with the proposal look-ahead?

581
01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:13.819
Potuz: Yeah, because of the proposal look-ahead, in most cases, it's going to be a very minor issue. In most cases, you can always use the head state.

582
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:31.370
stokes: There was another good comment here with calling out that if there was ever a mass slashing event on mainnet, you know, the same reasons we want this on testnets, let's say, would apply here. So…

583
01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:40.610
stokes: Yeah, again, it is actually a pretty small change, something we can test very easily, and yeah, would be good to have.

584
01:27:44.540 --> 01:27:51.659
stokes: So yeah, again, as it looks like, I think we're gonna need another call to get through all of this. Let's just take that as context for now.

585
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:56.609
stokes: And I'll just comment, yeah, seems like…

586
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:59.330
stokes: people lean towards including it in Glamstra.

587
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:13.649
stokes: Okay, let's see, I think then the last thing here, and we just have, yeah, should have enough time to get through this, would be 7688.

588
01:28:13.930 --> 01:28:17.769
stokes: This is adding stable containers, as it's featured as a ZSpec.

589
01:28:18.250 --> 01:28:30.899
stokes: And, yeah, the name is good. It keeps things stable, and the things here are these generalized indices. This, you know, has to deal with how we make proofs and reason about CL data structures.

590
01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:38.640
stokes: Again, this is a very nice quality of life improvement, for people using that part of the spec and the protocol.

591
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:48.140
stokes: And yeah, there, again, there's strong support from the NEMBUS team, I remember, and also many community people here have come to speak to us.

592
01:28:48.720 --> 01:28:59.249
stokes: At the same time, as it was called out by someone, you know, it's kind of been in a holding period for a while, just because the question is, like, yeah, it's nice to have

593
01:28:59.550 --> 01:29:02.879
stokes: Is it gonna move the needle that much? This is a debate we can have.

594
01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:08.710
stokes: And, yeah, would anyone like to add some comments, on this one?

595
01:29:12.710 --> 01:29:25.030
stokes: One question I would have is, if we move forward with this in Glenster Dam, would client teams feel like they need to re-audit their SSD codebases? That's, at least for me, the thing that gives me some pause here, just because…

596
01:29:25.450 --> 01:29:30.530
stokes: You know, that's… That's a much heavier process than just, say, a spec change.

597
01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:43.259
stokes: Okay. Came in here in the chat, says it's nice to have.

598
01:29:44.630 --> 01:29:47.470
stokes: But nice to have is not necessary to have.

599
01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:51.619
stokes: Greg?

600
01:29:53.700 --> 01:30:07.449
Greg K | Lido: Yeah, for Lato side, this AIP is quite important, because it reduces a lot of extra work of the engineering team, has in every upgrade.

601
01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:17.159
Greg K | Lido: So, yeah, there was also a post of, Dmitry in the PR of the previous, ACD call, but, yeah, it's,

602
01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:31.889
Greg K | Lido: it will be quite important for Lido if this EIP gets in, because, currently, it needs hard fork. If there are changes in this localization, this is a lot of extra work for the engineering team.

603
01:30:33.050 --> 01:30:37.510
Greg K | Lido: So I will post also here the link of the previous methods.

604
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:56.560
stokes: Okay.

605
01:30:57.290 --> 01:31:00.700
stokes: Anyone think we should defer 7688?

606
01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:10.739
stokes: Again, I don't have all the client team opinions handy.

607
01:31:11.850 --> 01:31:15.010
stokes: But I do recall there was, yeah, mixed support.

608
01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:30.130
stokes: Okay, then in that case, I think we move ahead as follows, so…

609
01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:35.339
stokes: Yeah, the intent was to get through as much of this today as we could.

610
01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:43.019
stokes: there's a lot to cover, so, you know, that is what it is. We also do… do have time.

611
01:31:43.530 --> 01:31:51.500
stokes: We should settle Glenstrom scope in November, but that means we have at least one more call on the CL side to discuss this.

612
01:31:51.930 --> 01:31:58.350
stokes: I also think, given Fossil and all the considerations there, it does make sense to take another call, so let's do that.

613
01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:04.070
stokes: So, just to be clear, we will make final…

614
01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:09.760
stokes: CFI, DFI decisions on the CLEAPs on the next call, so two weeks from today.

615
01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:19.079
stokes: So, I think, again, with this context today, this helps people refine their client views, and let's, yeah, keep doing that.

616
01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:25.460
stokes: Let's get to final versions by the next ACDC.

617
01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:33.180
stokes: And the big thing in parallel will be sorting out, how to make this credible commitment to fossil.

618
01:32:33.550 --> 01:32:40.599
stokes: Please, if someone has, you know, an idea here, feel free to propose. I will also propose some things, and…

619
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:52.140
stokes: I might even try to grab some time on next ACD, so next week's ACDE, just to touch on this, if there's 5 minutes or so, if we need to sort through any proposals,

620
01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:55.139
stokes: That have been made, just to see what makes sense.

621
01:32:55.960 --> 01:33:01.670
stokes: Otherwise, we'll need to, find the best option two weeks from today. And…

622
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:07.019
stokes: Assuming we do that, then we'll have a path towards fossil and H-star.

623
01:33:07.210 --> 01:33:12.190
stokes: We'll go ahead and pick some number of these other EIPs for Amsterdam.

624
01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:18.230
stokes: One thing we can't say that we did today was, DFI 8068.

625
01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:21.750
stokes: for Amsterdam, so that's some good progress.

626
01:33:22.170 --> 01:33:26.849
stokes: And then otherwise, yeah, we'll keep moving things forward on the next call.

627
01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:28.550
stokes: Francesco?

628
01:33:29.650 --> 01:33:49.509
Francesco: Yeah, just quickly wanted to ask, there's, some support in the chat for splitting this, like, churn-sharing thing as an alternative to 71, into its separate VIP. I'd just like to have, like, an official confirmation that if I do that, that would be considered fine, even if it wasn't PFI'd by the deadline, because otherwise I'm not gonna do it.

629
01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:54.779
stokes: It seems fine to me. I don't know. Does anyone have an issue?

630
01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:58.040
stokes: It was kind of just an evolution of 61.

631
01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.890
stokes: And or 71. Like… I, I think…

632
01:34:01.890 --> 01:34:02.260
Francesco: It's like.

633
01:34:02.260 --> 01:34:02.780
stokes: You know, pardon.

634
01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:04.649
Francesco: of 7061 right now, basically. Right.

635
01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:17.559
stokes: Right. I mean, the way that I see this is the deadline was more just to fix, like, possible scope. You know, like, what we don't want is someone to come in today, or next week, being like, hey, I have this whole new EIP we should think about.

636
01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:24.290
stokes: Whereas this is just, you know, a refinement of things that, you know, we're already talking about, so seems perfectly fine to me.

637
01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:52.049
stokes: I wanted… okay, maybe I'll just do this with my voice. Jihoon here asked in the chat, do we put all candidates on the table and discuss their headliner for H-star or just Fossil? So… well, okay, I was about to say the opposite, Sophia. I think…

638
01:34:52.870 --> 01:34:57.879
stokes: So yeah, I mean, this is one option, is we do actually just start discussing H-star headliners.

639
01:34:58.380 --> 01:35:03.529
stokes: I'm not sure if we would necessarily want to do that, but it's an option.

640
01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:10.780
stokes: I would personally start to think about ways just to credibly commit to Fossil and H-star.

641
01:35:11.040 --> 01:35:14.849
stokes: Via, you know, whatever process mechanism makes sense.

642
01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:22.960
stokes: We did touch on this earlier in the call that, yeah, maybe we should go ahead and have the conversation if we want to think about fossils, 6-second slots, and these things.

643
01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:33.030
stokes: I can try to reach out to some of the 6-second slot authors of the EIP, and yeah, try to fill it out.

644
01:35:35.630 --> 01:35:43.249
stokes: It might be a little tricky to get the right people in, you know, prepared two weeks from now to have that conversation, but it's an option.

645
01:35:43.890 --> 01:35:48.689
stokes: So yeah, I can be in touch with everyone, and we'll find the right path forward here.

646
01:35:55.950 --> 01:36:02.640
stokes: Okay, we're out of time. Thank you, everyone. There's a lot to get through, but I think we've made some good progress today.

647
01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:06.180
stokes: And… yeah, I'll see you all around.

648
01:36:07.050 --> 01:36:14.280
stokes: Also, DevConnect's coming up. I don't know if you will be there, some of you will, I think some of you won't, but yeah, it should be very fun, so…

649
01:36:14.650 --> 01:36:18.779
stokes: See you there, if you can make it, and if not, see you next time on ACD.

650
01:36:20.050 --> 01:36:20.950
stokes: Goodbye.

651
01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:22.070
Potuz: Bye-bye.

652
01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.660
Carl Beekhuizen: Thanks, Paul.
