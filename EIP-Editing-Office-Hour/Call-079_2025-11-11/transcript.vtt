Josh Davis: No problem.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.390
Pooja Ranjan: If you would like, you can perhaps assign us, one of us, as host, and we can…

4
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.339

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.170
Gajinder Singh: Right, Booja.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.560
Pooja Ranjan: Hi, Gudgender.

12
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.549
Gajinder Singh: Let me stop the sharing and see what happens.

13
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.489
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, please.

14
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.140
Pooja Ranjan: I've shared the… Agenda link in chat.

15
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.830
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, so we can see your screen now.

16
00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.080
Pooja Ranjan: If you're ready, we can go live.

17
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.080
Akash | ECH: VLN.

18
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.110
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour, meeting number 79. This is issue number 1809 on

19
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:52.160
Pooja Ranjan: Ethereum slash PM GitHub repository. Thank you, Gajendar Singh. Gajendar is an EIP editor who is going to take this office hour and review proposals which are added on EIP GitHub repositories.

20
00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.689
Pooja Ranjan: So Gajendra, it's all yours. Maybe we can start with a review proposal.

21
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.120
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, thank you, Pooja. Let's get started.

22
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.040
Gajinder Singh: Looks all good.

23
00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.840
Pooja Ranjan: Cool. Yeah, I noticed that this proposal is not for Fusaka.

24
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.250
Gajinder Singh: Welcome.

25
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.460
Pooja Ranjan: Maybe it is for Glamsterdam.

26
00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.770
Gajinder Singh: Amsterdam, and…

27
00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.039
Pooja Ranjan: I'm sorry, I'm hearing an echo.

28
00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.510
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah. Nevertheless, the proposal can be moved in the review status, even if it is not slated for

29
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.650
Pooja Ranjan: Like, further ahead in the network upgrade, schedule.

30
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.200
Pooja Ranjan: The next one.

31
00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.319
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, we can move to the next one.

32
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:09.630
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, the next one we have here is your draft. I think there are a bunch of open proposals for draft.

33
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.050
Gajinder Singh: So I did review this, and I did a few more comments, and come back to it when the author will get all done.

34
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.009
Pooja Ranjan: Awesome The next PR is 10768.

35
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.799
Gajinder Singh: From the type… from the description of this pair, it seems like it's an ERC.

36
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.960
Pooja Ranjan: Hmm, that's interesting.

37
00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:17.279
Pooja Ranjan: Maybe, yeah, metadata interface, yes, sounds definitely like that. Maybe we want to let the author know about it.

38
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.410
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, it seems like yesterday.

39
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.860
Pooja Ranjan: Oh yeah, they have mentioned it in as well, yes.

40
00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.490
Pooja Ranjan: So we can just left a comment here.

41
00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:32.379
Pooja Ranjan: for the author to move this proposal to ERC Depot.

42
00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:16.970
Pooja Ranjan: Next PR is 9374.

43
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.579
Pooja Ranjan: Entity operations, yes.

44
00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:34.140
Pooja Ranjan: It seems like you have already reviewed it once, but the author seems to have responded to your comments.

45
00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:53.370
Gajinder Singh: But a lot of the comments don't seem addressed, it seems.

46
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:02.800
Pooja Ranjan: Alright.

47
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.840
Pooja Ranjan: We can perhaps, get to next PR, which is… 10311.

48
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.870
Pooja Ranjan: It seems that you have already addressed Rest of the drafts.

49
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:36.709
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, all of them have been addressed.

50
00:12:36.710 --> 00:12:38.470
Gajinder Singh: All of them have been addressed, so yeah.

51
00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:39.470
Gajinder Singh: Yep.

52
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:25.509
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, it is definitely unclear to me, like, what we are trying to fix here. Oh, it's ELO in optional value, sorry. No, I was referring to the other one.

53
00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:34.729
Gajinder Singh: I think this is best addressed by the author, but why is the author not tagged over here?

54
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:40.750
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, and I have noticed the issue that author is not being tagged in multiple other PRs.

55
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.009
Gajinder Singh: So, I think I commented this,

56
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:51.849
Gajinder Singh: There's somewhere in all the PRs where only assets are modified.

57
00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:53.889
Gajinder Singh: The authority is not being tagged.

58
00:13:55.650 --> 00:14:02.240
Gajinder Singh: So… This is success… 475…

59
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:34.040
Csaba: Hey!

60
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:36.980
Pooja Ranjan: Yeshamba?

61
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.380
Csaba: Hi.

62
00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:39.530
Gajinder Singh: Hi.

63
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:41.830
Csaba: I don't know how the email.

64
00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.179
Gajinder Singh: I don't know how to eat.

65
00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.910
Csaba: jumping in, so…

66
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.330
Gajinder Singh: So…

67
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.209
Pooja Ranjan: No worries. I believe Gajan.

68
00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:50.670
Gajinder Singh: place.

69
00:14:50.670 --> 00:14:57.230
Pooja Ranjan: On your end, if it would be… Muting, that might help, yeah.

70
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.000
Csaba: Packaging the…

71
00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:07.160
Gajinder Singh: Yep, hello.

72
00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:16.799
Pooja Ranjan: Shabba, do you have any particular PR that you would like to get it reviewed? If so, please drop the link in the chat.

73
00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:21.690
Csaba: Yeah, so I was jumping in for that to ask how it works, actually.

74
00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:27.209
Csaba: I'm just stopping the link soon, and then… Or you can see.

75
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:41.950
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, generally, we create an issue for that, so you can also drop the link in the issue, and we can add it here, but while we have you on the call, you can just…

76
00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.239
Pooja Ranjan: Drop the link in the chat, and we can pick it up from there.

77
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.840
Csaba: Okay.

78
00:15:58.110 --> 00:15:59.640
Csaba: Just have to find a link.

79
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.100
Csaba: the window.

80
00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:19.540
Gajinder Singh: I think this seems to be adding a bunch of… God…

81
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:29.790
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, and here also, if you notice, that every time editors are only tagged, the author of the proposal is

82
00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:33.170
Pooja Ranjan: No, it is for website type effects, right?

83
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:37.240
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, yeah, it… correct…

84
00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.710
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, so definitely author is not required, so yeah.

85
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.359
Gajinder Singh: The author is not triple, actually, yeah.

86
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:51.510
Gajinder Singh: And, wales, or whatever is the other names he has.

87
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:57.530
Gajinder Singh: made a good bunch of PR for improving the documentation and adding some tools.

88
00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:02.949
Gajinder Singh: But, all of them needs to be addressed by Sam.

89
00:17:04.369 --> 00:17:06.699
Pooja Ranjan: Would you want me to move it to EIPIP meeting?

90
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:15.750
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, I am asked… I have asked this particular PR author to create an issue.

91
00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.850
Gajinder Singh: For… and list all his PRs for improving the documentation and all that.

92
00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:27.220
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, that would make sense, then I will pick it up from the issue section.

93
00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:45.860
Gajinder Singh: I think, I have… this is another PR where… A person is… So, just trying to add…

94
00:18:46.180 --> 00:18:47.280
Gajinder Singh: a section.

95
00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:01.760
Gajinder Singh: I somehow remembering… reviewing such a PR, and I see it again. I don't know.

96
00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:05.900
Gajinder Singh: Just comment.

97
00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:23.870
Pooja Ranjan: So there is a question in the chat.

98
00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:39.320
Pooja Ranjan: So, it seems that there is a proposal which is already merged, and the EIP number is 8077, and we are joined by Shabba. He has some questions with respect to motivation and rationale. Yeah, please, Shabba.

99
00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:48.080
Csaba: Yeah, so… I can… when I was writing it, I realized that…

100
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:56.950
Csaba: Between motivation and rational, it was not real to me what's kind of the… The, the light, light differentiation.

101
00:21:57.310 --> 00:22:00.160
Csaba: So I was… I was using…

102
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.719
Gajinder Singh: I'm refusing…

103
00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.230
Csaba: Well, first I had mostly motivation.

104
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:13.280
Csaba: And then I… I've seen that, so, all the taxing motivation, and then I've seen that rationale is… is proposed to be, kind of, to…

105
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.180
Csaba: discuss design with Ryan, so I tried to do that. But I wanted to check if I understood.

106
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:22.760
Csaba: Well, if that's how it's used.

107
00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:28.549
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, motivation is, why… why are you proposing this? What is the pain point that you are trying to solve, right?

108
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:33.870
Gajinder Singh: So, it's basically why, and again, as you mentioned, rational is what…

109
00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.910
Gajinder Singh: What are… what is the reasoning behind making…

110
00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:44.499
Gajinder Singh: some design changes that you have done, or why this particular EIP compared to some other

111
00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.960
Gajinder Singh: alternative EIPs that are out there.

112
00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:49.210
Csaba: Okay, I see. Yeah, yeah.

113
00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:55.840
Csaba: Yeah, and the other… another dubbed I had is…

114
00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:03.930
Csaba: I see most EIP… so this is networking specific, specific on DevP2P, which has its version numbers.

115
00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:08.860
Csaba: And most proposers are already putting version number ahead.

116
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:13.270
Csaba: Hoping that it will be that one. I was not putting it,

117
00:23:13.570 --> 00:23:15.639
Csaba: This is just more of a question, like.

118
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:21.030
Csaba: That's something which can be updated last minute to the right version number.

119
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:32.139
Csaba: Right, so it's typically E slash 69, or 70, or 71. But because I don't know when… what will be the time ordering, obviously version number is not clear at this point.

120
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:48.029
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, that is fine, we understand that, and before you move to review, basically, you should update the version number, because you will move to review when there is a high chance of including it in some particular

121
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:48.900
Gajinder Singh: art folk.

122
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:59.180
Csaba: Yeah, the other thing with these AIPs, that they are not bound to have folks, so… So…

123
00:24:00.690 --> 00:24:04.739
Gajinder Singh: So if you're not bound to heart folks, then still, basically, you know.

124
00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:09.309
Gajinder Singh: Whenever you have consensus among clients, right? So…

125
00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:09.889
Csaba: Yeah.

126
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:11.870
Gajinder Singh: Because clients need to implement.

127
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:14.699
Gajinder Singh: And, these net interfaces, and,

128
00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.589
Gajinder Singh: so when you have consensus in ACD, then basically…

129
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:24.660
Gajinder Singh: they will also allocate a particular version for it, right? So, that's how it goes.

130
00:24:25.270 --> 00:24:29.129
Csaba: Okay. Yeah, thank you. I know it's basic questions.

131
00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.019
Csaba: But I wasn't sure about the places.

132
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:33.739
Pooja Ranjan: No worries.

133
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:34.970
Gajinder Singh: Very nauseous.

134
00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:45.659
Pooja Ranjan: One last piece of information, Shabba, I don't know if you are aware of it, or if it applies to all networking proposals. These days, even Networking proposals are also included in MetaEAP.

135
00:24:45.750 --> 00:25:00.009
Pooja Ranjan: So, if you go ahead with the normal review status, when you are ready and comfortable and you have some temperature check, you can add it to review. Otherwise, it can be used when it is considered to be a part of, like, future upgrade.

136
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:09.750
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, not necessarily that it will be included in Meta EAP if it is not being implemented by all the clients at the same time, but generally this is now going to be a run.

137
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:16.689
Csaba: With Metaape, you mean, you mean the ones related to house folks, or… or something else?

138
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:31.110
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, so for example, if you take a look at 7607, which is Hard Fork Meta for Fusaka, you would find, other proposals there, 869, 7642, which is a networking proposal, and that is also included in here.

139
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:40.620
Csaba: Yeah, I know, I know, but it's something we actually discussed in ACD, and what was explicitly said is that we are not including order networking proposals in the meta.

140
00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:46.240
Csaba: Also, not to… to overload the… the pluses of the…

141
00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:50.029
Csaba: Of the… of the FOLIC decision and ordering.

142
00:25:50.410 --> 00:26:05.620
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, no worries there. I just mentioned it in case it does not go through, like, normal course, then that is also an alternative, so when it is, can be used this path. Yeah, thank you so much for joining, and feel free to join in future calls if you have any further questions.

143
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:15.380
Csaba: Thank you, and, yeah, the… for joining. Now I was just jumping on the call, because I've seen it in the calendar, but it was kind of the preferred way, so, like.

144
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:21.690
Pooja Ranjan: Exactly the preferred way. You can just drop a link to your PR or question on the agenda and join the call.

145
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.960
Csaba: Perfect. Thank you very much.

146
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.240
Pooja Ranjan: Okay.

147
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:26.890
Csaba: Thank you, to you.

148
00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.600
Csaba: Bye-bye.

149
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:29.730
Pooja Ranjan: My hair.

150
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.830
Gajinder Singh: And this seems correct, but it's better that author reviews this.

151
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.780
Gajinder Singh: So I'll just drop in the comment and see whether author has been tagged or not.

152
00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:51.720
Pooja Ranjan: No.

153
00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:54.269
Gajinder Singh: I'm not sure. No one asked me that.

154
00:26:55.020 --> 00:27:00.819
Gajinder Singh: These, statuses are still running, so maybe I'll just close and open the pull request.

155
00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:13.019
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I noticed, like, there are a few proposals in which authors are not being tagged. I don't know why something might have broken, we need to take a look into that.

156
00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.409
Gajinder Singh: Alright, so now the review board is running, and probably…

157
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.989
Gajinder Singh: Authors will be there… will be tagged.

158
00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.870
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, that's cool.

159
00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:09.739
Pooja Ranjan: So I see, and next week, I see a bunch of… related to deposit snapshot. I don't know if…

160
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:17.340
Pooja Ranjan: They all are interrelated, or by the same proposer. Could we just… Kind of make them batch.

161
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:24.129
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, so I… did… Commented on some of the max deposit removal thing.

162
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:41.299
Gajinder Singh: I mean, this… Technically, the previous one is also fine, and this is also fine.

163
00:28:42.550 --> 00:28:44.930
Pooja Ranjan: There are a bunch of them with the same…

164
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:46.090
Gajinder Singh: Family, like, the same.

165
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:49.259
Pooja Ranjan: Kind of similar requests, yeah. Edit.

166
00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:57.309
Gajinder Singh: But again, authors are not tagged, because I think the changes in assets

167
00:28:57.730 --> 00:29:02.050
Gajinder Singh: And our boat is not, sort of, Plugging anything that is…

168
00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:05.980
Gajinder Singh: Like, in the authors, wherever assets are getting changed.

169
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:11.080
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, in that case, maybe we can…

170
00:29:11.730 --> 00:29:14.659
Pooja Ranjan: We can tag the authors, yeah.

171
00:29:34.030 --> 00:29:38.669
Pooja Ranjan: Or would you want to, like, close and open all of them? There are 3, 4.

172
00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:45.779
Gajinder Singh: No, this is not because of closing or opening. This is…

173
00:29:46.210 --> 00:29:49.010
Gajinder Singh: Because we have a faulty bot.

174
00:29:49.610 --> 00:29:53.890
Gajinder Singh: That is not tagging authors when anything is changing in assets.

175
00:29:55.160 --> 00:30:10.409
Pooja Ranjan: Oh, now I get it. Okay, okay. We need to even check that. If any changes to assets… I don't think that we have this thing in the past, that if there is any change in assets report, then…

176
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:15.949
Pooja Ranjan: authors are tagged. It was only for the body and the, header of,

177
00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:20.109
Pooja Ranjan: a proposal, so we might have to revisit it. Good point.

178
00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:29.689
Gajinder Singh: So, there have been a bunch of such peers, and I have sort of tagged Sam in each of them.

179
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:32.350
Gajinder Singh: With the same text, or similar text.

180
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:35.900
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's a good cut.

181
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.310
Gajinder Singh: I think I commented over this…

182
00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:55.750
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, I did comment, I don't…

183
00:30:55.910 --> 00:31:00.069
Gajinder Singh: So some of… some of… I feel that I have reviewed similar PRs.

184
00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:05.399
Gajinder Singh: And, commented over them, but…

185
00:31:05.730 --> 00:31:07.170
Gajinder Singh: They seem to be showing up.

186
00:31:08.340 --> 00:31:10.249
Gajinder Singh: Without my comments, so…

187
00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:14.260
Pooja Ranjan: There are approximately 300 PRs now.

188
00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.340
Pooja Ranjan: So, I don't know if people are just trying to repeat their peers…

189
00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:24.279
Pooja Ranjan: Or they are, like, coming up with a lot of suggestions.

190
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.590
Pooja Ranjan: Your reputation is not the case.

191
00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:42.420
Gajinder Singh: I think I approved another such PR, but what some of these people are trying to do is basically is

192
00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.040
Gajinder Singh: Partially, you know, they are trying to

193
00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.550
Gajinder Singh: spread the same change across many PRs. So, for example, you have many

194
00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:53.809
Gajinder Singh: Asset files over here, and if the same…

195
00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.839
Gajinder Singh: changes over… over all the assets file, they are not trying to make a one PR for it.

196
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.140
Gajinder Singh: they're just trying to create separate wheels. I don't know, maybe it's…

197
00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:09.259
Gajinder Singh: Because they are trying to farm something, not sure about it, but I'll just add in the comment anyway.

198
00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:29.759
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I think making a different PR is good here, because we would like to tag the author of individual EIPs, so it makes sense to have different PR for different EIP, but it would be a good idea to have them listed in one issue, so people know that, okay, fine, this is the set of changes you are proposing for different EIPs.

199
00:32:29.870 --> 00:32:31.620
Pooja Ranjan: It will be easier for editors.

200
00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:36.349
Gajinder Singh: No, even for the same EIP, but you have many asset files, right? So…

201
00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.109
Gajinder Singh: across the same as a file for the same EIP, they are doing multiple PRs for the same thing.

202
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:44.300
Gajinder Singh: for example, this ABC…

203
00:32:44.550 --> 00:32:51.770
Gajinder Singh: where unused import, it is, it might be across, maybe, you know, whatever files are there in this particular EIP asset.

204
00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:59.380
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah, then definitely making it look like Most number of PRs merged.

205
00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:40.200
Gajinder Singh: And again, I mean, author should have been tagged, but this is something that I can just verify and approve.

206
00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:11.980
Pooja Ranjan: One last PR in this series is PR10577.

207
00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:14.450
Gajinder Singh: Oh, seems like my browser is stuck.

208
00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:20.339
Pooja Ranjan: Do you want to rejoin or something?

209
00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.220
Gajinder Singh: Okay, it responded.

210
00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:17.859
Pooja Ranjan: So next, I have added a few PRs which seems to be either spam or no longer needed, perhaps could be closed.

211
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:23.190
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, if you could review and confirm that, then we can get them closed.

212
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.740
Gajinder Singh: I think, Sam would be able to more definitely say whether these are needed or not.

213
00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:38.429
Gajinder Singh: I can check for the… 10567…

214
00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:56.390
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, so generally speaking, a stagnant… I mean, I have added it here for a reason. Generally, stagnant is a bot action. Bot makes a proposal to go to stagnant, and it was by a user, so that's why I flagged it here.

215
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.960
Gajinder Singh: So this is a withdrawn EIP user is trying to move to Stagnant and.

216
00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.030
Pooja Ranjan: That's not allowed, yeah, so anyway…

217
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.030
Gajinder Singh: allowed there, so anyway…

218
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:25.260
Pooja Ranjan: Definitely a spam action.

219
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:35.410
Gajinder Singh: I mean, I don't know, but maybe user wants to champion it?

220
00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.889
Gajinder Singh: Let's ask this question, because…

221
00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.269
Pooja Ranjan: But it's not allowed for any proposal.

222
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:41.659
Gajinder Singh: It does not allow for any.

223
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:51.919
Pooja Ranjan: withdrawn or final status cannot be resurrected. If he would want to do that, then he has to come up with a new proposal, even if you want to keep the entire content same.

224
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:08.770
Pooja Ranjan: And if he wants to resurrect, why would he recommend going to stagnant status? Bring it to withdrawn, review, or some other status, right?

225
00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:12.910
Pooja Ranjan: Sorry, bring it to draft or review status.

226
00:41:10.890 --> 00:41:14.799
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, this seems to be it for today.

227
00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:27.609
Pooja Ranjan: And, thank you, Gajinder. Super. Yeah. Thank you for, like, looking at the PRs before the call. That was helpful, we could run fast.

228
00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:46.429
Pooja Ranjan: With the peers which were added. Thank you so much for your time, and people watching this recording later on, or listening us on YouTube or Twitter, we do have a few announcements. We are going to have EIP Summit at Argentina, so if you're around, please join us on November 21st, you can find that.

229
00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:57.570
Pooja Ranjan: information on, DevConnect calendar, and the next office hour is canceled for next Tuesday. We will see you on November 25th at 1600 UTC.

230
00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.500
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, everyone, for joining us here today.

231
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:04.389
Gajinder Singh: Thank you, everyone, for joining us here today. Thank you, Guido. Thank you, everyone.
