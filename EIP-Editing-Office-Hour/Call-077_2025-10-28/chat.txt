If you have any specific PR for review or questions for the editor, please share the link here.
00:45:49	Pooja Ranjan:	@Rajat K Wasan 
Do you have any questions about the comment Victor added two weeks ago? If so, we can discuss it next.
If not, I’m happy to include the PR in the next meeting, hoping the suggested changes have been implemented.

We can include in the next meeting.
01:00:58	Pooja Ranjan:	I see you’ve already responded to G’s comment. We may not have enough time today to get to it.

If it’s not merged by then, I’ll add it to the Nov 4 meeting, if that works for you.
