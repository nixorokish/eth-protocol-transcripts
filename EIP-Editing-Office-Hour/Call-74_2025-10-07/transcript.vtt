00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.720
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, Kumar, Kwame.

2
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.110
Pooja Ranjan: Sir… If you guys have a specific PR, can you please drop the link? Yeah.

3
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:31.930
Pooja Ranjan: Instead of the number, it would be easier to follow the link, and we can take it one by one. Sam would be a couple of minutes late today, so please bear with us. We are going to have the call, just maybe a few minutes later.

4
00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.850
Pooja Ranjan: Pam, it looks like 1243 is not added to agenda.

5
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:12.560
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I think it would be a good idea to add it. Do you have any specific question with respect to that proposal? Or PR? Or just the review you're looking for?

6
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:18.610
kwame: It is a, update from the last session that I was at.

7
00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:26.129
kwame: there were some updates that, Sam was wanting me to… to do on it, so I had, just did those.

8
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.879
Pooja Ranjan: Very well. In that case, I'll just go ahead and add it into the review, peer.

9
00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.670
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, thank you.

10
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:33.000
Pooja Ranjan: Quick question for Sir. I know you may not be able to speak, but perhaps you can respond in the chat. So, you mentioned that the new PR

11
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:39.290
Pooja Ranjan: is a replacement for EIP? What does that mean? Like, you don't want to

12
00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:51.810
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, I don't understand the replacement mean. Is it something new that you are trying to propose, and in future, people can use this additional EIP instead of 7980?

13
00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:14.730
Pooja Ranjan: I see it now. So, 7980 is originally withdrawn.

14
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.700
Pooja Ranjan: So maybe this is a new…

15
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.410
Pooja Ranjan: Proposal that people would like to follow.

16
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.150
Pooja Ranjan: Yep.

17
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:39.850
Pooja Ranjan: That's perfectly alright, yeah. Because this proposal is already withdrawn, even if it is, like, exact same, we could use it, but as you are mentioning, that it has a different backing algorithm, it's perfect. Thank you.

18
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.460
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome, Sam.

19
00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:27.290
Sam: Hello.

20
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:38.810
Pooja Ranjan: Hi, Sam. Good to see you. So, we are already joined by a few authors. They have their… they have already shared their proposals. If we are ready, we can perhaps move the stream over.

21
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.299
Pooja Ranjan: Should we go live?

22
00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.600
Pooja Ranjan: Anadakash, you can perhaps move over the screen.

23
00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:14.559
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour, meeting number 74. This meeting will cover proposals, PRs from EIP and ERC GitHub repositories.

24
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:23.160
Pooja Ranjan: On agenda, we have a bunch of final proposals, PRs to move proposals into last call, a few for review.

25
00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:35.320
Pooja Ranjan: And a good section here today is about miscellaneous and forced merged, and perhaps some spam that we would like to deal with. And also, proposals for new draft to be added today.

26
00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:48.710
Pooja Ranjan: We are joined by a few authors on the call here today. Some, the first one is for final proposal, and the PR number is 1230. We are joined by the author Kumar here.

27
00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.210
kumar: Yes, hello. Yep.

28
00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.400
Sam: Let's give this a read.

29
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:07.489
Sam: Okay, this person… this person money, person money…

30
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.520
Sam: Okay, I don't think this has changed significantly so far from the last time I read it.

31
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:20.150
kumar: Yep, correct.

32
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.370
Sam: Okay.

33
00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:33.569
Sam: 20 million…

34
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:35.920
Sam: Yeah, this all looks good.

35
00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:41.289
Sam: And let me just take a look at this…

36
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:47.270
Sam: And… I want to look at your assets as well.

37
00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:50.760
Sam: 7291.

38
00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:14.619
Sam: That looks good…

39
00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:32.160
Sam: Yeah, that sounded nice. Okay, cool.

40
00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.789
Pooja Ranjan: Congratulations, we have… One proposal moved to final standard here today.

41
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.499
kumar: Alright, thank you so much.

42
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.049
Sam: Oh, my pleasure.

43
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:55.210
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, next we are joined by author, who wants to move the proposal to review status. The PR number is 1243 on ERC.

44
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:02.139
Pooja Ranjan: We are joined by Kwem for any questions.

45
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:03.570
Sam: Okay, cool.

46
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.669
Sam: Let's take a look.

47
00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:22.730
Sam: Alright, here, C315 is the minimum. Okay, let's start with title here, so…

48
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:35.990
Sam: Each participant provides a verifiable acceptance and testation once the required set of acceptances are present and fresh.

49
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.590
Sam: Okay…

50
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:07.540
Sam: So this is a super minor feedback, but here is Stripe 2.

51
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:33.849
Sam: It's not like a requirement, but just a thought. Agents do have to be tagged together with a trust coordinator, existing intent standards, 7521, 7683, define single initiative flows and do not specified multi-party agreement.

52
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:41.700
Sam: You'll see it specifies the smallest on-chain perimeter for that gap with initiative 721… 71 to Intent.

53
00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.780
Sam: 71210, so…

54
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:45.519
Sam: You know what, I think that's understandable. As long as you define what intent is, I don't think that's going to be a problem. Because I'm assuming it just means an EAP712, like, encoded and signed message, and I think that's understandable. The intent becomes executed while the required set of acceptances to present an expired protocol.

55
00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:46.860
Sam: Okay…

56
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:08.210
Sam: Okay… the keywords math shouldn't matter.

57
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.390
Sam: Okay implementation tab, and…

58
00:18:32.530 --> 00:18:38.080
Sam: Seriously specifies.

59
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:56.730
Sam: Okay, deterministic hashing rows… Okay… let's use the following… U712 domain… Okay… 5267… 5267…

60
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:05.419
Sam: propose, purging nonce.

61
00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:31.510
Sam: No, there's a whole section on nonsense, perfect. Okay. Agent ID…

62
00:19:39.150 --> 00:19:40.860
Sam: Kev…

63
00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:50.070
Sam: Coronation payload, doo-do-do.

64
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:35.949
Sam: Okay, okay, so what are these specifying? Typed data hashes, so these are just saying…

65
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.559
Sam: So I'm gonna look at participant's hash…

66
00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:02.485
Sam: K…

67
00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:36.450
Sam: per agent. Acceptance services are optional. If implemented, it must be straight. Okay, perfect.

68
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:45.459
Sam: Limitations to revert registration custom errors or revert strings for the following basic conditions, and may define additional errors for various specific modules.

69
00:23:45.570 --> 00:23:53.699
Sam: Okay… Yep, okay, suppression of intent, acceptance in the off-chain, okay…

70
00:24:01.170 --> 00:24:02.500
Sam: 1271…

71
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:15.080
Sam: Yeah, I think this is good. These comments are…

72
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:20.109
Sam: Really, really minor. Feel free to, you know.

73
00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:27.950
Sam: sort them out while you're in review. Yeah, thanks for coming out.

74
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.730
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.

75
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:46.500
Pooja Ranjan: So, the next author who has joined here as today is for a proposal which is already in a withdrawn status, and he's trying to propose a new PR. The PR is on EIP GitHub repository 10373.

76
00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:52.849
Pooja Ranjan: And, yeah, perhaps this will be the replacement of a withdrawn proposal.

77
00:24:53.100 --> 00:25:02.669
Pooja Ranjan: And we are joined by Sir, but he may not be able to speak, he may not have a good microphone, here to respond in chat if there is any question.

78
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.520
Sam: Sure.

79
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.129
Sam: Okay, wait, so…

80
00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:24.860
Sam: So you said this is a replacement for a withdrawn, EIP, or…

81
00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:30.590
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah, for a withdrawn one. And the number of that proposal is 7980.

82
00:25:40.930 --> 00:25:43.130
Sam: Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah.

83
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:46.440
Sam: And… what? Was that one withdrawn?

84
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:48.649
Sam: There's no withdrawal reason.

85
00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.069
Pooja Ranjan: That's a problem. It's the same author, maybe he got some better ideas here.

86
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:59.020
Sam: Oh, it's… it doesn't show up in the rendered… Huh.

87
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:05.199
Sam: Gonna open a bug for that.

88
00:26:23.260 --> 00:26:25.999
Pooja Ranjan: I have a bunch of spams listed for you, Sam.

89
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.130
Pooja Ranjan: On this agenda itself, I have listed.

90
00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:32.620
Sam: Okay. Buck port…

91
00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.220
Sam: Okay.

92
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:05.579
Sam: It's an EMP7932 algorithm type for P256 support types 0x0.

93
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:20.070
Sam: So there's the algorithm of supporting P256 signatures. That is… yep. P256, like P256R1 is widely used in this unit's algorithm that already has presence in the lithium codebase.

94
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.740
Sam: SEEP defines a new 7932 algorithm type of the following parameters.

95
00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:34.770
Sam: Okay… Do-do-do…

96
00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:44.209
Sam: The teacher says something about RIP7212.

97
00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.500
Sam: Ugh, that's annoying.

98
00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:44.129
Sam: There we go. Okay. Sec256 is an electric charge known as P256 and PREM256V1 carriers for the following domain. I'm sure that's all correct, because I…

99
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:53.940
Sam: Definitely can't read cryptography code. Eptic curve, signature fabrication steps…

100
00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:04.490
Sam: Fair request must be prepared for the pre-compiled contract.

101
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.310
Sam: Dishna… 500 gas penalty…

102
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:15.690
Sam: Okay, good. Yep.

103
00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:21.200
Sam: Cool.

104
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.070
Sam: Alright, where are we off to next?

105
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.819
Pooja Ranjan: We can finish up the final proposals. There are two more.

106
00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.580
Sam: Sure.

107
00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:47.630
Sam: Okay…

108
00:31:09.530 --> 00:31:15.730
Sam: Code chain ID with transaction hash. Way to encode a chain ID and transaction hash into Unique's true format.

109
00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:48.140
Sam: combination opportunity and transaction hash into one string, and this is for an ERC.

110
00:31:49.600 --> 00:32:10.230
Sam: Okay. Think about transaction by attach hours for correct context for the chain. If the chain information is included in the string itself, finding the right chain for the transaction is easy. Such strings can then be used, for example, on forwarded servers that forward to the correct blockchain Explorer. The chain ID is included in some object format, such as the transaction object inside the blockchain itself, but that object is a lot of unneeded data for our purposes.

111
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:27.239
Sam: Chain ID generated chain ID. The chain ID must be based on 8.55, and the chain ID repository stated in that EIP. Transaction hash known as TX hash, must include the 0x prefix. The section TX acting as a type identified. The syntax is chain ID.

112
00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.220
Sam: Dun dun.

113
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:39.090
Sam: An example for a transaction with hash blah that was issued on chain ID1 is… Okay…

114
00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.299
Sam: I think this is fine.

115
00:33:03.770 --> 00:33:05.689
Pooja Ranjan: We have one more final here.

116
00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.500
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.

117
00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:13.020
Sam: 3009.

118
00:33:13.870 --> 00:33:16.460
Sam: This is an oldie. Alright.

119
00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.980
Pooja Ranjan: Happy to see people making effort to finally finalize their proposals.

120
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:33.440
Sam: Yeah.

121
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:43.539
Sam: Okay, so let's start by looking at the history of this.

122
00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:45.139
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, just a thought, like.

123
00:33:45.450 --> 00:33:52.950
Sam: Can we move from stagnant to final directly, or we have to go back to the original status? You have to go back to the original status.

124
00:33:56.530 --> 00:34:00.060
Sam: So what was it here?

125
00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:10.250
Sam: Stagnant, alright? That means it's probably stagnant here as well.

126
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:13.980
Sam: Yeah, let's…

127
00:34:17.170 --> 00:34:19.860
Pooja Ranjan: It's before the split time, pretty old.

128
00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.810
Sam: So, draft. Okay.

129
00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:24.110
Sam: So…

130
00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.020
Sam: Okay…

131
00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.930
Sam: So… title…

132
00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:04.220
Sam: Okay… What are the other things we have to fix in here?

133
00:35:04.590 --> 00:35:10.549
Sam: I feel like this would actually be kind of a useful exercise for office hours, updating a really old EIP.

134
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:11.429
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, right.

135
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:19.320
Sam: And, okay, so a couple… of these…

136
00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:29.430
Sam: Okay, and then… non-relative midlink, or… Yep.

137
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.110
Sam: Okay…

138
00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:14.306
Sam: Who cares…

139
00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:24.700
Sam: There's an existing spec, ERC…

140
00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:34.749
Sam: There's a 2612 that also has contract implements both for maximum compatibility, the T part of which is between the spec and…

141
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:36.680
Sam: I saw on you.

142
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:38.000
Sam: Okay…

143
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.879
Sam: Okay… So what are SWCs?

144
00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:59.470
Sam: There's just always more things… oh, not actively maintained.

145
00:37:03.610 --> 00:37:07.080
Sam: Okay, so what is the license of an SWC?

146
00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.750
Sam: It is MIT.

147
00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:23.199
Pooja Ranjan: WCs are not part of… not part of accepted links, right?

148
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.750
Sam: Correct, yeah.

149
00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:45.699
Pooja Ranjan: Not sure if it is the case for this particular link that they are trying to share, but in general, if SWCs are not actively maintained, they cannot be even part of accepted link, even if someone makes a proposal. Is that correct? Yeah, pretty much.

150
00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.110
Sam: That looks nice for this. I think that looks nice, let's go with that.

151
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:10.810
Sam: 777… URC677… Probably doesn't exist.

152
00:39:45.370 --> 00:39:49.750
Sam: I haven't been able to catch my introduction? Okay.

153
00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.705
Sam: Hmm…

154
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.879
Sam: That looks fine…

155
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:10.660
Sam: Implementation…

156
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:17.069
Sam: And these should be subheadings…

157
00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:55.369
Sam: Okay… Yeah, so that seems decent. Commit changes…

158
00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.069
Sam: Wait for the refresh button to show up…

159
00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:15.329
Sam: Oh, you do need a discussions too, though, I missed that.

160
00:42:15.570 --> 00:42:17.610
Sam: Alright…

161
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:29.949
Sam: It says, yes, in 2009…

162
00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:47.329
Sam: Oh, somebody else, I guess, already resumed the 7758.

163
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.130
Sam: How's that one doing?

164
00:42:53.430 --> 00:42:58.769
Sam: Yeah, I guess I should probably leave a comment to that effect as well.

165
00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.100
Pooja Ranjan: This is a unique case here.

166
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:07.590
Pooja Ranjan: So, which one would be…

167
00:43:08.590 --> 00:43:12.990
Pooja Ranjan: Like, if they have to move forward, which one will be preferred, if that is?

168
00:43:13.710 --> 00:43:14.950
Pooja Ranjan: Can be used here.

169
00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:15.940
Pooja Ranjan: the order.

170
00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.700
Sam: I mean…

171
00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.290
Pooja Ranjan: Mia, and… yeah.

172
00:43:18.430 --> 00:43:22.999
Sam: I think that's up to them to figure it out, if they want to, like.

173
00:43:23.170 --> 00:43:27.229
Sam: They're listed as authors on the new one, so they can withdraw it if they want.

174
00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.270
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

175
00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.749
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that would be a better approach, because

176
00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:36.189
Pooja Ranjan: Keeping an stagnant would not help.

177
00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:38.570
Sam: Yeah, exactly.

178
00:43:56.370 --> 00:44:09.010
Sam: Okay, back to here. Transfer with authorization, ERC… Hmm… token?

179
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:10.550
Sam: Token.

180
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.335
Sam: Mmm…

181
00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:30.060
Sam: And…

182
00:44:36.690 --> 00:44:38.520
Sam: Let's see here…

183
00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:52.600
Sam: Grab this, go here, go here… Edit you again…

184
00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.029
Sam: Discussions 2 comes right after author.

185
00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:57.500
Sam: Hey.

186
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:59.029
Sam: Go away.

187
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:12.130
Sam: And let's see if this passes now.

188
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:54.219
Sam: MIT, MIT, MIT… Okay, that all seems good…

189
00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:59.189
Sam: Did I miss anything? I did. What did I miss?

190
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:43.930
Sam: Should make a browser extension that just, runs EAPW inside of the GitHub UI. That would certainly make my life slightly easier when I'm doing this kind of work.

191
00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.579
Pooja Ranjan: Definitely a good idea.

192
00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:00.970
Sam: No.

193
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:04.090
Sam: I can't believe I didn't catch that.

194
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:06.889
Sam: Let's fix that…

195
00:47:24.430 --> 00:47:30.470
Sam: World's noisiest PR review, okay…

196
00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:52.810
Sam: Good, so now we can approve this.

197
00:48:56.690 --> 00:48:58.060
Sam: Cool. Okay.

198
00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:05.160
Sam: So, let's see, can we go to last call in 15 minutes? If this is a small one, probably.

199
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:09.059
Sam: So this one needs to go to last call first.

200
00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:22.910
Sam: So why hasn't this merged? This hasn't merged because Cloud Code doesn't know how to do Eap Validator. That's fine. 7892.

201
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:31.490
Sam: Okay, so… 7, 8, 9, 2…

202
00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:55.290
Sam: Oops, 7892, are you in… you're in last call. Oh, I see, so that just needs to be updated.

203
00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:10.320
Sam: Can I update you? No?

204
00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:14.859
Sam: Okay, so I'll have to do this myself. So…

205
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.269
Sam: Go here, go here… go here…

206
00:50:20.890 --> 00:50:28.460
Sam: Sorry, I'll be off-screen for a second here, and… Oops, we're not bad.

207
00:50:33.310 --> 00:50:37.569
Sam: Okay. Fetched, time to go.

208
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:45.770
Sam: I get a checkout. Last call.

209
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:17.270
Sam: There we go. Look back over here… this has been updated.

210
00:51:42.290 --> 00:51:44.080
Sam: Okay, so…

211
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.830
Sam: We're good. This'll merge on its own now. Perfect. Actually, just in case, I'll also give it an approve.

212
00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:07.610
Sam: Okay… Cool. Maybe we could do one more.

213
00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:11.609
Sam: 1189. What's going on on this one?

214
00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:38.230
Sam: Okay, let's give this a read.

215
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:42.180
Sam: Hmm…

216
00:52:43.070 --> 00:52:53.560
Sam: Generalized contract on services, defined factory for generic… Defense Factory capable of deploying generic services on specific contracts, such as 437 accounts and services and functionalities operating in the…

217
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:57.519
Sam: Yeah, that's much better, okay.

218
00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.479
Sam: Think… Yeah, perfect. This is all good.

219
00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:11.830
Sam: Nope, wait.

220
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.039
Sam: Almost 2 weeks from today.

221
00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.320
Sam: 21st.

222
00:53:28.690 --> 00:53:29.680
Sam: Alright.

223
00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:37.829
Sam: I guess that's, it for today for me. Thanks everybody for coming out. Thanks for putting up with the long queue times.

224
00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:39.480
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, Sam.

225
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.250
Sam: See you on the next call.

226
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:43.379
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, everyone.
