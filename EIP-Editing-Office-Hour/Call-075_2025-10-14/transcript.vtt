00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.909
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, Victor, how are you?

2
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hello, hello?

3
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:22.660
Zainan Victor Zhou: Ave.

4
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: Thank you, Pooja. I hope you had a wonderful day.

5
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: earlier. It's noon time at your time zone, right?

6
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.509
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, it is exactly known.

7
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.949
Zainan Victor Zhou: Nice. How's everything with you?

8
00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.089
Pooja Ranjan: All good, all good.

9
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.209
Pooja Ranjan: So, Victor, in this meeting, we generally hope to share a screen. Would you want to check it before

10
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.230
Pooja Ranjan: Study.

11
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:57.059
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, let me clean up my desktop, and then, so that I can quickly… Share screen without issue.

12
00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.459
Zainan Victor Zhou: Do-do-doo… One thing… one other thing to be…

13
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.700
Pooja Ranjan: Mindful of is…

14
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:14.969
Pooja Ranjan: That it would record… it would record everything, and with all the audio, it will be uploaded to the

15
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:21.219
Pooja Ranjan: a website, because this is, like, EIP plus ERC editing office hours.

16
00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:22.849
Zainan Victor Zhou: Makes sense, yes.

17
00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:28.359
Zainan Victor Zhou: Totally makes sense. Let me remove my things…

18
00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:45.059
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me have my… Ethatford, our Discord channel, polling up on my other screen.

19
00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.759
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

20
00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.829
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you give me the list of… I think you share the list of, of things to be…

21
00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:06.819
Zainan Victor Zhou: Reviewed, right?

22
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.280
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, I just have shared the link to the agenda in chat, Zoom chat. You may refer that.

23
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.939
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes, and let me show you what my screen look like at the moment.

24
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.249
Zainan Victor Zhou: Dun, dun dun-dun.

25
00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.930
Zainan Victor Zhou: This one.

26
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:34.339
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, this is my screen. Can you see it?

27
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.749
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, would it be possible for you to maybe increase the font size? I don't know, for some reason, it's very, very tiny for me.

28
00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, yeah, my screen.

29
00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.659
Pooja Ranjan: Yep, perfect, cool. Yeah, looks all good, and .

30
00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:48.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes.

31
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:53.039
Pooja Ranjan: We should be ready to start streaming whenever you are.

32
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.149
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, let's go. We can get a little screening.

33
00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:00.170
Pooja Ranjan: All right.

34
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.850
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour.

35
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:07.830
Pooja Ranjan: This is meeting 75.

36
00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:25.450
Pooja Ranjan: And has been added on GitHub Ethereum PM repo with issue number 1761. On today's agenda, we have a couple of proposals for last call, a bunch for review, and many more for draft status.

37
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.920
Pooja Ranjan: So, we are joined by editors.

38
00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:38.240
Pooja Ranjan: Editor Victor. Victor, thank you for joining us. Maybe we can go ahead and get started with taking a look at the last call proposals.

39
00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:48.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: Thank you very much, Booja. Before everything else, let me check, do we have anyone live on the, on the call?

40
00:06:48.680 --> 00:07:00.659
Pooja Ranjan: Not yet. I will inform you in chat, or will mention if there is anyone to follow up, but I have added their PRs as we collected it from ECH Discord.

41
00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:02.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: Sounds great.

42
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, as always, want to, remind, authors of…

43
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:22.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: We will try to prioritize anyone who's live on this editor calls, and if not, we'll go with the, we will go with the provided agenda. And thanks very much to each cat herder for the facilitation.

44
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:31.789
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, this is moving from a draft to last call, which is… Very weird.

45
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.210
Pooja Ranjan: Hmm, maybe it is.

46
00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:33.690
Zainan Victor Zhou: that means…

47
00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:34.120
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

48
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.650
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, let me make sure that…

49
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: Teddy knows this, like, usually it would go from draft to review.

50
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.070
Zainan Victor Zhou: And, and then, review to last call.

51
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:52.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… Unless there is a reason to expedite and take an exception.

52
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:57.899
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm not seeing the discussion about exceptions, so…

53
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.240
Zainan Victor Zhou: I would say, Teddy, can you…

54
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.279
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is a first-time user.

55
00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.540
Zainan Victor Zhou: And who's trying to move…

56
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is interesting.

57
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:35.720
Pooja Ranjan: There is an additional note about this particular PR. I mean, definitely a proposal cannot go to just last call after draft status. It has to go through review before getting into last call. Perhaps the author does not know. But it was also mentioned by editor, Gajendel.

58
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:41.479
Pooja Ranjan: that it is, in the PR trying to add some reference link.

59
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.319
Pooja Ranjan: I believe, Gajendar left some comment on Edita's channel at ECH Discord. Yeah, and he…

60
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.030
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

61
00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:48.650
Pooja Ranjan: Yep.

62
00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:58.989
Zainan Victor Zhou: there's a lot of, weird things that we don't see from this call, from this request. First of all, proposer

63
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.979
Zainan Victor Zhou: Poser is not one of the author.

64
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:17.299
Zainan Victor Zhou: And that's a red flag. I don't know if authors will approve it. Definitely needs author's approval before coming in. A draft should, a status change

65
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.889
Zainan Victor Zhou: should be separate.

66
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:36.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: from content change. And third, is it should move from… From draft to review first.

67
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: And then review to last call.

68
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:47.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: any other… requests… are exceptional.

69
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: No, and should only be granted.

70
00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:58.050
Zainan Victor Zhou: By call or action input.

71
00:09:58.410 --> 00:10:03.420
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see… Exception.

72
00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: No.

73
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.720
Zainan Victor Zhou: consensus of VIP editors, such as…

74
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:19.759
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I think we will re… we will reject this, and then get… move it back to you.

75
00:10:19.870 --> 00:10:24.470
Zainan Victor Zhou: To the author, to the author of this pull request, and then move to the next one.

76
00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:28.340
Pooja Ranjan: This sounds good, and it was a really very good catch here.

77
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:33.259
Pooja Ranjan: We can perhaps move on to the next PR, which is for last call, and the number is.

78
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:33.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: is one…

79
00:10:33.890 --> 00:10:34.900
Pooja Ranjan: 24th.

80
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.290
Zainan Victor Zhou: One token, I… actually, this could…

81
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.930
Zainan Victor Zhou: be caught by EIP review bots.

82
00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think.

83
00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:46.990
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right.

84
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.890
Pooja Ranjan: I'm not sure if.

85
00:10:48.890 --> 00:10:52.179
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me… yeah, let me give the feedback to… to…

86
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.909
Zainan Victor Zhou: to, to Sam and C.

87
00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:08.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: To see if this could be automated, reviewed by… these… break, blocking.

88
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.600
Zainan Victor Zhou: conditions.

89
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:13.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: Could be automatically reviewed and caught.

90
00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.640
Zainan Victor Zhou: by EIP bots.

91
00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:22.570
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is it called EIP Bot, or it's called EIP Review Bot, yeah.

92
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.240
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

93
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:33.830
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, that would save our… Several minutes from just now.

94
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.790
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, that's very true.

95
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:44.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, let me double check. I don't think I see this person's… From the author list.

96
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I'm correct.

97
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:51.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

98
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.249
Zainan Victor Zhou: And so that is done.

99
00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.519
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, the next one… we should have a checkbox, right? So that when.

100
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.159
Pooja Ranjan: Whenever we…

101
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: Fun, yeah.

102
00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:28.300
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah. But we have to stop that, because now, there is an ACD bot, which is running in the background, and every time we check the checkbox, it triggers multiple messages going out and people in the background. So we had to stop that checkbox, and we are going by bullet points.

103
00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.579
Zainan Victor Zhou: We should have a task list that ACT bots should be…

104
00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:39.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: River East… oh, this is a long time ago, okay.

105
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:52.260
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay… So, let's take a look… Omni Revenue… Is one of the author… Moving from review…

106
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:57.110
Zainan Victor Zhou: Extension to limit transferability.

107
00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.740
Zainan Victor Zhou: on counts.

108
00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:01.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: What discounts?

109
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Among NFTs.

110
00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:12.699
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm not sure if I read… understand transfer accounts. Oh, how many times a transfer can happen, I guess?

111
00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:14.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: Based on counts.

112
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.950
Zainan Victor Zhou: Consider…

113
00:13:26.670 --> 00:13:27.400
Zainan Victor Zhou: Listen.

114
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:36.439
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can, like, maybe it's just me. Do you think that counts, is… Sufficiently disambiguous here.

115
00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: Pooja.

116
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:44.980
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, it definitely requires a little bit more explanation. I'm not sure if it is already there in the…

117
00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:47.969
Pooja Ranjan: Body of the EAP.

118
00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.210
Zainan Victor Zhou: How's that? Let me see if it will work.

119
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.099
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is a bit…

120
00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:21.579
Zainan Victor Zhou: US, and, I do need to fuse it.

121
00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:28.129
Zainan Victor Zhou: And, consider… elaborate it.

122
00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:44.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: Amount NFT, that's still a little bit of, like, amount NFT of the same user or not.

123
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:52.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, let me actually… common… Keep takeaways.

124
00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.300
Zainan Victor Zhou: Motivations and key takeaways.

125
00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Transfer limit for a token.

126
00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

127
00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.190
Zainan Victor Zhou: So…

128
00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:11.690
Zainan Victor Zhou: reference implementation. Let me actually show info.

129
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:13.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

130
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hmm.

131
00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hmm.

132
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:35.990
Zainan Victor Zhou: Transfer account.

133
00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:40.880
Zainan Victor Zhou: That transfer limit.

134
00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.440
Zainan Victor Zhou: Limit and count.

135
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: One trend is set or update.

136
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:05.929
Zainan Victor Zhou: There is a lot of language issues, I think.

137
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.559
Zainan Victor Zhou: That's ambiguous to me.

138
00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:15.629
Zainan Victor Zhou: For example, like, let me see… let me see the discussion whether… People give discussion feedback.

139
00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.350
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, unanswered question.

140
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yep, I think the…

141
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: Great idea.

142
00:16:36.290 --> 00:16:40.230
Zainan Victor Zhou: What… well, I'm not sure if it will limit the liquidity further.

143
00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:49.679
Zainan Victor Zhou: Businesses… We can see trading… Yeah, there's an unanswered question.

Zainan Victor Zhou: I was thinking… Nike.

294
00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:10.259
Zainan Victor Zhou: Because numbers are increasing quick.

295
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:13.380

Zainan Victor Zhou: New, completely new… What? No.

297
00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.240
Zainan Victor Zhou: We don't put Twitter in here.

298
00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:32.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: I don't think we need to put Twitter in here, but just to check the policy.

299
00:39:32.650 --> 00:39:33.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm nauseous.

300
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:36.070
Pooja Ranjan: So, we don't put… I mean, people can put Twitter.

301
00:39:36.070 --> 00:39:37.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's… That's fine.

302
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:37.780
Pooja Ranjan: Damn.

303
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:48.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, multi-agent console to resolve information queries in… Decentralizedly? Decentralized.

304
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: Obstacles.

305
00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:57.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: Of courseatory thing… So, get information in arbitration and build…

306
00:40:01.570 --> 00:40:03.420
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see…

307
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:04.359
Zainan Victor Zhou: How does your… your specification.

308
00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.810
Zainan Victor Zhou: Man days.

Zainan Victor Zhou: Or commit review.

313
00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:47.590
Zainan Victor Zhou: And… consider… Adoption or discussion.

314
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hmm.

315
00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:54.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

316
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:20.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see… Structure…

317
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:27.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm not sure.

318
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:37.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: A… capability…

319
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:57.479
Zainan Victor Zhou: Most of the… or strings… And, have… one included in…

320
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:10.040
Zainan Victor Zhou: Would there be a limit?

321
00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:11.600
Zainan Victor Zhou: Practical.

322
00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:14.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: or technical.

323
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:19.490
Zainan Victor Zhou: Of the size of… capabilities…

324
00:44:23.410 --> 00:44:24.780
Zainan Victor Zhou: Practical…

325
00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:30.590
Zainan Victor Zhou: Boom.

326

00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: Good reviews.

330
00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:58.300
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oof.

331
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:16.080
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

332
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:19.559
Zainan Victor Zhou: Left a few.

333
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:24.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: Also… two things.

334
00:45:25.460 --> 00:45:28.960
Zainan Victor Zhou: We would like to see… Pinterest.

335
00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:39.609
Zainan Victor Zhou: Communities… interest in… adopting… It… reference implementations.

336
00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:41.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: No.

337
00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, this is my comment on this one.

338
00:45:49.130 --> 00:45:52.030
Zainan Victor Zhou: What about… What's the next?

339
00:45:53.490 --> 00:45:57.430
Pooja Ranjan: So the next one here we have got is 1225.

340
00:45:59.020 --> 00:45:59.810
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

341
00:45:59.810 --> 00:46:03.650
Pooja Ranjan: Well, we covered 23, 24, 25, all three proposals today.

342
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:07.809
Pooja Ranjan: This is to move into review status, yes.

343
00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, mostly… Nomino.

344
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:28.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: And then I can see… the background is the Fukusha update, so that's why.

345
00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:34.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: Commons… Key stores.

346
00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: A link is not happy.

347
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:53.439
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think the links are okay, I'm not sure why they… Change… Some section, okay.

348
00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:56.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think it's okay.

349
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:49.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

350
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:50.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: Next one…

351
00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.760
Pooja Ranjan: The next one is PR number 1242, another one for review.

352
00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:01.540
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay…

353
00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, just moving to review.

354
00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:11.670
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see… let me take a read…

355
00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:17.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: Multi-version proxy.

356
00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:29.019
Zainan Victor Zhou: Remove version, register version, interesting.

357
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.710
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alright.

358
00:49:10.590 --> 00:49:11.640
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

359
00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:18.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think it's okay, there's a review. I would call for Nick Mudge to review, to also share technical review.

360
00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.130
Pooja Ranjan: That sounds good.

361
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:22.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, Apple.

362
00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:26.779
Zainan Victor Zhou: Congrats on moving to review.

363
00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Like for the eel.

364
00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:46.619
Zainan Victor Zhou: Invitations… of the following… Here, review yours.

365
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:48.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: All the time, man.

366
00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:55.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: ERC, and also dial into… Alright.

367
00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: What steps?

368
00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.310
Pooja Ranjan: The next PR is a little.

369
00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.209
Zainan Victor Zhou: One second, one second, let me…

370
00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:44.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

371
00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:50.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay. Next one.

372
00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:59.909
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, the next one is that the PR number is 1014. It is to move EIP… sorry, ERC4337 to review…

373
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.290
Pooja Ranjan: But it is already in review status.

374
00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:12.639
Zainan Victor Zhou: 437 is in review. It's a… Oh, that's cute.

375
00:51:13.810 --> 00:51:16.879
Zainan Victor Zhou: What would you say… what do you mean it's already in review?

376
00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:26.379
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, I think there were two PRs. With one PR, the proposal has already been moved to review status. Perhaps we should close this one.

377
00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:34.890
Pooja Ranjan: If you open EIPS.ethereum.org, you may find the proposal is already in review status, so there's no point merging this PR.

378
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:35.840
Pooja Ranjan: Unless…

379
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:36.450
Zainan Victor Zhou: I should week.

380
00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:43.339
Pooja Ranjan: Or any other change, yeah. So, unless there is any other change than review status, we can perhaps close this one.

381
00:51:43.620 --> 00:51:46.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: What's the other one that you mentioned?

382
00:51:47.670 --> 00:51:57.759
Pooja Ranjan: I don't remember the other one, but if you check the status on EIPS.ethereum.org, it is already in review.

383
00:51:58.130 --> 00:51:59.609
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, let me do this.

384
00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.270
Pooja Ranjan: Maybe I can quickly check and let.

385
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:04.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, this is our work.

386
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:10.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think we were interacting with this one, right? But,

387
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:19.039
Zainan Victor Zhou: Which is the… what is another one for… I don't see…

388
00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:24.450
Pooja Ranjan: I think it is 7… 7922, is it the one?

389
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:27.620
Pooja Ranjan: No, the last one which is merged on…

390
00:52:27.620 --> 00:52:30.930
Zainan Victor Zhou: This one… I have that on my screen now.

391
00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:32.690
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah.

392
00:52:32.690 --> 00:52:33.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, yeah.

393
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:43.590
Pooja Ranjan: So it is already merged. Now, we either have to close the existing one, or just look if there is any other change than changing the status, then we can perhaps.

394
00:52:43.590 --> 00:52:44.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: Sadness.

395
00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:48.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: Change has been… merged on.

396
00:52:49.370 --> 00:52:57.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can we… Update the branch, and… Yeah.

397
00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:02.399
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, it's a good thing, now we can see K7 in review status.

398
00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:16.260
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right, Oja, it would be very helpful if we can review the ones that's not merged, like… So, I think, like, branches out of date should be excluded from our review list.

399
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:23.960
Zainan Victor Zhou: they should… Author should keep the branch out, within the update, within the branch.

400
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:29.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: That is correct, yeah. Not out of the… yeah, because things like this could easily be caught by

401
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: By, checking whether the branch is out of date.

402
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:45.219
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, so we might want to give a comment to author, like, what is the next step? Like, as you have mentioned, maybe we update the branch, or just close the PR, and come up with a new one with changes, if you have any.

403
00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:51.379
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, yeah, to a sync… Sync with main…

404
00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:57.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: branch, or close this PR if there are No.

405
00:53:58.510 --> 00:54:02.290
Zainan Victor Zhou: other… Updates, major…

406
00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:11.510
Pooja Ranjan: Just wanted to, let the author be communicated.

407
00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:14.429
Pooja Ranjan: Before this is closed by any of the editors.

408
00:54:14.670 --> 00:54:16.529
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, yeah, I kept it open.

409
00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:22.950
Pooja Ranjan: Very well, I think I see a couple of more with…

410
00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:40.170
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, I don't know if you may be able to look into the still part, so we can perhaps jump to the next draft. The PR number is 1087 for Universal Compliance Router. This is pending for a while.

411
00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: This one, right?

412
00:54:52.890 --> 00:54:53.350
Pooja Ranjan: Yes.

413
00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:54.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: compliance router.

414
00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:55.690
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah.

415
00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:58.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, what's the latest update?

416
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:11.899
Pooja Ranjan: It seems there are some changes added based on editor's recommendation, and the file hasn't been viewed.

417
00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:13.860
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

418
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:20.049
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is a new EIP, ERC, so let me go check the numbering.

419
00:55:20.590 --> 00:55:27.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: 79… 7210… 10…

420
00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.440
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

421
00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.580
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's a different assignment.

422
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:37.819
Pooja Ranjan: What does…

423
00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:43.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: Am I… am I typing it wrong? Okay, sorry, I think I clicked on the wrong… wrong one.

424
00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, okay, that's fine. So the… the number assignment is correct.

425
00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:50.870
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, it should be dropped.

426
00:55:52.850 --> 00:55:56.720
Zainan Victor Zhou: Should easily be caught by… by bot.

427
00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.660
Zainan Victor Zhou: Mmm… I should really start fouling.

428
00:56:21.220 --> 00:56:22.060
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

429
00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.659
Zainan Victor Zhou: Feature request…

430
00:56:29.370 --> 00:56:31.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, yeah.

431
00:56:32.620 --> 00:56:34.359
Zainan Victor Zhou: Another example.

432
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:48.399
Zainan Victor Zhou: That was already filed.

433
00:56:54.350 --> 00:56:56.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: -Oh, I couldn't link it.

434
00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:57.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: What happened?

435
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:04.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: I need a permlink, actually.

436
00:57:09.690 --> 00:57:12.010
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, no, doesn't work this way.

437
00:57:14.370 --> 00:57:16.249
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let's see, where is the perm link?

438
00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:19.550
