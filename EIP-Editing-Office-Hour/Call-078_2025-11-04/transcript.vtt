00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.899
Pooja Ranjan: Hey, Nick, so thank you for joining. I know that was giving us some hard time, but I don't know how it got enabled.

2
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.450
nixo: Yeah, no problem. It's the, it's the EF ZoomBot that is the host,

3
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:42.280
nixo: I have to figure out, like, I feel like there's a way to assign you as an alternative host, but for some reason, in the interface, when I try to do it, it won't let me pick anyone outside of the organization, and I don't know if that's because, like, some settings in our organization, but,

4
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:54.670
nixo: I have a meeting to jump into right now, but I think that we should meet and try to figure this out, because, like, it's not ideal for you not to have access to these… the transcripts, the logs, everything. You should be…

5
00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.470
Pooja Ranjan: Sounds good, yeah.

6
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.550
nixo: of hosting.

7
00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.689
Pooja Ranjan: Sure. Yeah, we can, connect async and try to figure it out one day, to solve it forever. All right, thank you, Nixa.

8
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:06.430
Pooja Ranjan: Sounds good. Appreciate it, yeah.

9
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.650
nixo: You invited us.

10
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.540
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome, Sam.

11
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:18.709
Sam: Hey, how's it going?

12
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.230
Pooja Ranjan: Good, good.

13
00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.800
Pooja Ranjan: Just give me a second, sorry we ran into this host issue. We are trying to figure it out, hopefully it will be done by next week, but someone from EF

14
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.599
Pooja Ranjan: Helped us get it through for today.

15
00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.850
Pooja Ranjan: We'll just get you started in… 1 to 2 minutes.

16
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.749
Pooja Ranjan: May you want to check your screen sharing in the meantime?

17
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.109
Pooja Ranjan: Sam, would you mind increasing font size a little bit?

18
00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.929
Pooja Ranjan: Yep, that would work, thank you.

19
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.789
Pooja Ranjan: Do we need AIs?

20
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.479
Pooja Ranjan: For notes, I know the notes will be added on forecast later on.

21
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.659
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, I think this is time, we can perhaps go ahead and get started.

22
00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:14.050
Pooja Ranjan: And people will join. I know a couple of authors have reached out to me, so they would be joining. In the meantime, we can go ahead and get whatever we can cover on the agenda.

23
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.280
Sam: Sure thing.

24
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.069
Sam: So I've already taken care of most of the.

25
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.979
Pooja Ranjan: Sam, one minute, please. We may have to hold this.

26
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.690
Pooja Ranjan: Akash to let us know.

27
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:45.270
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour Meeting Number 78. This is issue number 1791 on Ethereum slash PM GitHub repository. In our today's meeting, we are going to look into EIPs as well as ERC pull requests.

28
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:50.550
Pooja Ranjan: We are joined by Editor Sam Wilson. Thank you, Sam, for joining us here today.

29
00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.509
Sam: Happy to be here.

30
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.560
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I see some of the authors have also joined,

31
00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:09.819
Pooja Ranjan: So, perhaps we can go ahead and get started to maybe cover the first final proposal, if it hasn't been already done, and then we'll get to the PR for authors.

32
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.640
Pooja Ranjan: Request here.

33
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.290
Sam: Sure.

34
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.179
Sam: Hmm, so what do we do in here?

35
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.980
Sam: Okay…

36
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.920
Sam: Let's start by looking at there…

37
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.700
Sam: Okay.

38
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:54.010
Sam: So, standard interface for NMT… okay. NMTH is probably what it does… Okay.

39
00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.639
Sam: A standard interface for NFTs specifically designed for AI agents where metadata represents agent capabilities requires privacy protection.

40
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.840
Sam: Okay…

41
00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:56.470
Sam: Okay…

42
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.669
Sam: This all looks like valid solidity.

43
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.920
Sam: Okay…

44
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.020
Sam: Okay, then a reference implementation… some NFTs…

45
00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.999
Sam: Yeah, that all looks good. All right.

46
00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:02.540
Sam: You can go to final.

47
00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.760
Sam: Alright, so what do we have in the chat here? So…

48
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.069
Sam: Alright, David, let's go take a look at your proposal here.

49
00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:26.029
Sam: Did you have any specific questions, or just wanted to… just wanted to review on it?

50
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.989
david: Yeah, it would be great to just get a review for it.

51
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:33.960
Sam: Sure.

52
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:28.109
Sam: So, everything else looks good.

53
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:33.680
Sam: So, contract ownership… Okay, redefine a multi-step contract ownership interface.

54
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.859
Sam: We're a more secure client.

55
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:48.450
Sam: Or… more secure contract ownership management. This makes the ownership transfer

56
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:56.749
Sam: Into three distinct steps, with the first two steps performing the original owner, initiate, confirm, the remaining one step performed by the new owner, accept. Okay.

57
00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:01.719
Sam: How do we enforce an optional time window between initiate and…

58
00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.500
Sam: Shit. Confirm.

59
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.960
Sam: Stages to give industry room for review and make ownership key compromise.

60
00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:27.040
Sam: Yeah, okay.

61
00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:33.129
Sam: Okay. Ownership management is crucial, and on-chain security and a significant…

62
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:46.179
Sam: portion of the security assumptions of DeFi. On-chain management is crucial in on-chain security and a significant portion of the security assumptions of DeFi protocols. Smart contract wallets and on-chain utilities.

63
00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:17.329
Sam: super minor, like, grammar nitpick here, but because this is a list, it's easy to read the second part as part of the list, but I don't think it is.

64
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.920
Sam: I'm not even gonna comment on that because it's really just nitpicking, but… yeah. The single-step ownership-style ownership mechanism has been in the industry for a long time.

65
00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.919
Sam: Has been used ubiquitously industry go up.

66
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.670
Sam: Jessica Mercedes joining for a multi-step time gate ownership management.

67
00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:07.259
Sam: Tog-gated ownership management… something. Process?

68
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:13.459
Sam: To enhance the ecosystems, contract ownership to a more viewable, stoppable, thorough, and secure. Okay.

69
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:20.049
Sam: So, yep, that's good. Multi-step ownable.

70
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.410
Sam: Okay…

71
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.960
Sam: Must update the buffer period with initiation, then confirmation after the existing buffer period.

72
00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:13.390
Sam: The brake train, owner keys come from a scenario, okay… Shouldn't this be an interface?

73
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.430
Sam: Mmm…

74
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:28.240
Sam: Okay.

75
00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:39.909
Sam: Yeah, so…

76
00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:27.279
david: Actually, this section was, written in this format to be in line with the original ownership standard.

77
00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:32.080
david: And, within the ERC173,

78
00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:38.170
david: If I'm not mistaken, within the rational, I think it had something in line with that.

79
00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.309
Sam: Yeah, this is…

80
00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:45.380
david: A fairly old standard, so it doesn't follow the rules as strictly.

81
00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.849
Sam: Yeah, so… A good example here, like… sorry,

82
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:01.749
Sam: Other schemes that were considered is definitely good rationale content.

83
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:09.840
Sam: Because that, like, like, it describes why you made the choices that you made.

84
00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:17.520
Sam: These ones seem more like… Very general things about the proposal, like,

85
00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.400
Sam: So why would you want a multi-step ownership standard.

86
00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:30.990
Sam: These… these things all answer that, except maybe some simplicity. But…

87
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:39.050
Sam: why do you want this particular… actually, even why you want this particular standard is still motivation. You'd want to answer things like,

88
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:46.710
Sam: I had a good example here somewhere… Yeah, this one here.

89
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:51.800
Sam: So… I'm not saying that you need to move this, to be clear,

90
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:58.009
Sam: this is just a good example of what rationale should be like.

91
00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.920
david: Alright, yeah, I got your point.

92
00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:05.390
Sam: Yeah.

93
00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.329
david: I can have some nitpicking.

94
00:17:07.470 --> 00:17:08.750
david: for this part.

95
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.609
Sam: Yep, that looks good.

96
00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:37.300
Sam: Yeah, so, fix this up, and then, I'll get to review it eventually, and it should make it in.

97
00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.460
david: Thanks.

98
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.600
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, we can move to our last call proposals.

99
00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:48.830
Sam: Sure…

100
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.470
Sam: Okay So we do have an author approval on it.

101
00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.980
Sam: Okay…

102
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:55.050
Sam: Oh, I'm a… I'm an author on this one.

103
00:18:56.480 --> 00:19:01.670
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I noticed that, and I… I think that's why you had been asked for this one as well.

104
00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:09.629
Pooja Ranjan: But it was already reviewed by Victor, so perhaps we can still take it, even if you are the other.

105
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.120
Sam: Yeah, okay, so…

106
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:30.489
Sam: Nancy, 7, 8, 2, 8…

107
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:35.870
Sam: Yeah, okay, good.

108
00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.719
Sam: Mmm… Is there anything else immediately wrong?

109
00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:49.940
Sam: No, okay, so… Let's give this a read, then.

110
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:53.559
Sam: Accessible matter if I want to refresh specific in one chain.

111
00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:55.490
Sam: interpret addresses…

112
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:05.730
Sam: Really? Hmm.

113
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:19.180
Sam: I really don't like that this is a plural, and then refer to with a singular, but I guess that makes sense. Is a binary format to describe an address specific to one chain with a companion interoperable name specification for human-readable display?

114
00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:28.050
Sam: This is achieved for version length prefix, binary envelope that supports every link, binary data, the interpretations utilization rules for the data within the computer.

115
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:32.870
Sam: Okay…

116
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.360
Sam: Okay…

117
00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:24.719
Sam: Oh, interesting. I didn't realize we supported definition lists.

118
00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.050
Sam: Okay…

119
00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.929
Pooja Ranjan: Sam, a question.

120
00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.830
Sam: Yeah.

121
00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:26.369
Pooja Ranjan: So, for this

122
00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:42.970
Pooja Ranjan: PR, like, could we merge that as last call just now, or we should wait for the author to come back with the changes? Because it does not look like very big of changes. Definitely something that needs to be done before the funnel.

123
00:24:44.190 --> 00:24:47.909
Sam: Well, they're going from drafting to last call, so we probably have to.

124
00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.960
Pooja Ranjan: emerging from you anyway.

125
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.190
Sam: ways, so…

126
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:55.409
Pooja Ranjan: So that's a very fair point. Perhaps we can change the status right over here as well.

127
00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:58.710
Sam: Yeah, that's… I'll probably do that.

128
00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:07.289
Pooja Ranjan: And then the author will get plenty of time to make further iteration on this one.

129
00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.600
Sam: K, B, and F, J, K…

130
00:26:14.850 --> 00:26:17.960
Sam: Yeah, everything else seems fine. So…

131
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.249
Sam: And then because I'm an author on this, I don't… oh, I can't edit it.

132
00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:37.100
Sam: Well then…

133
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.379
Pooja Ranjan: Then we must add it as a comment, yeah.

134
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.760
Sam: Yeah, okay.

135
00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.019
Sam: So that will stay like that.

136
00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:54.190
Sam: Alright.

137
00:26:54.370 --> 00:27:02.450
Sam: 1, 2, 2, 4… What's going on with this one?

138
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:17.800
Sam: Unaddressed comments… that's… Go and take a look at that.

139
00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:49.300
Sam: Okay.

140
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.939
Sam: So, the 18th…

141
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.770
Sam: Okay…

142
00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.650
Sam: Okay…

143
00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.700
Pooja Ranjan: We should have some background music for these.

144
00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:03.279
Sam: Yeah, I know, I know. Sorry.

145
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.100
Pooja Ranjan: Oh, no, you're doing great!

146
00:33:05.770 --> 00:33:12.189
Sam: It's, it's a little easier when there's authors here to talk, but when it's just, me reading proposals, it's.

147
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:12.890
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

148
00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:40.815
Sam: K…

149
00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:46.489
Sam: Possible, I don't remember.

150
00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.289
Sam: I guess it isn't possible, because…

151
00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.059
Sam: You'd end up with… yeah, okay. So…

152
00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:25.500
Sam: Okay…

153
00:35:39.410 --> 00:35:43.110
Sam: 1333. So what are we looking at here?

154
00:35:43.520 --> 00:35:47.089
Pooja Ranjan: The last, last call proposal on agenda today.

155
00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:47.890
Sam: Yeah.

156
00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:57.479
Sam: Hmm… Cool. So, this was the Instrumental Standards Method for On-Chain Treasury Management of Institutional Assets.

157
00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.809
Sam: Ensuring secure private key generation hierarchical management department, yep.

158
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.380
Sam: Yeah, I mean, that seems good to me.

159
00:37:11.350 --> 00:37:16.679
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, so we have one… Proposal move to last call today.

160
00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:18.190
Sam: Yeah.

161
00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:32.869
Sam: 7, 8, 9, 3… 37 review… oh my god, there's a lot of stuff in here. Okay, a lot of them are images. That's… that's good.

162
00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:42.830
Sam: Alright.

163
00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:49.129
Sam: Okay, core interfaces…

164
00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:54.355
Sam: Hmm…

165
00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:41.699
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, it's good to see DeFi-related proposals also coming in, DeFi protocol.

166
00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:43.840
Sam: Yeah, yeah, it's nice.

167
00:43:46.950 --> 00:43:56.939
Sam: So, what would be the best category for this? I'm just trying to understand here. It's like interface for DeFi protocol to implement verifiable solvency proofs and monitor financial health status.

168
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:00.489
Pooja Ranjan: Should we still categorize it as ERC?

169
00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.719
Sam: Yeah, I think so. There's, like…

170
00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.680
Sam: URC is kind of, like, a really broad category. Interface…

171
00:44:11.590 --> 00:44:19.009
Sam: Interface, I think, has been used historically for RPC methods and for, like, solidity-level standards.

172
00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:24.190
Sam: This one is definitely an application-level standard, so I think it still makes sense as an ERC.

173
00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:31.500
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I mean, otherwise it will always create a confusion, because when the EIPERC repo split happens…

174
00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:35.179
Pooja Ranjan: Happened, then some of the proposals were, like, in that.

175
00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:35.690
Sam: Yeah.

176
00:44:35.690 --> 00:44:39.040
Pooja Ranjan: The to-go status, yep. Let's keep it ERC, it's simpler.

177
00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:55.820
Sam: K…

178
00:46:51.270 --> 00:46:57.259
Sam: The, use of tables and emoji definitely makes me think this is a, ChatGPT proposal.

179
00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.860
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah…

180
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:12.059
Pooja Ranjan: I mean, many times people take help of ChatGPT to maybe avoid any kind of typo, kind of do a better formatting and things like that, and then…

181
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:15.529
Pooja Ranjan: While doing so, these things appears as well.

182
00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:17.670
Sam: Yeah, like, I don't mind…

183
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:28.270
Sam: like, using ChatGPT to help, it's when they just generate pages and pages of content that doesn't really add anything to the proposal that it gets kind of annoying.

184
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.600
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, absolutely.

185
00:48:01.540 --> 00:48:04.420
Pooja Ranjan: for a DeFi proposal usage of AI.

186
00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:10.610
Sam: Alright.

187
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.109
Pooja Ranjan: We are joined by David again, maybe want to revisit.

188
00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:24.940
Sam: Oh, sure.

189
00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.329
Pooja Ranjan: Number 1 to 1-2?

190
00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:29.429
david: Yeah, I have addressed all the comments.

191
00:51:30.110 --> 00:51:31.510
david: Performer mentioned.

192
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:42.029
Sam: Alright, let me just reread these. Yep.

193
00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:03.760
Sam: Alright.

194
00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:25.690
Sam: Okay…

195
00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:48.020
Sam: So how does this work? Let me go back down here… Mmm…

196
00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.009
Sam: First steps that you initiate to a new owner.

197
00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:42.660
Sam: Mmm…

198
00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:56.619
Sam: So that… I'm not gonna, like, hold up the proposal on that, I'm just throwing it out as a suggestion. That's good.

199
00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:02.849
Sam: Okay… Yeah, then this is just moving your rationale.

200
00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:06.160
Sam: Awesome.

201
00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.020
Sam: Yep, those become interfaces.

202
00:54:26.710 --> 00:54:27.290
Sam: Hmm…

203
00:56:00.150 --> 00:56:03.359
Sam: No, interesting. So the idea would be if the,

204
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:10.679
Sam: Owner's key is leaked, then they could, like, front-run the attacker trying to change it.

205
00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:16.749
Sam: But doesn't that also work in the opposite direction? Doesn't that mean the attacker could front-run any…

206
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:20.280
Sam: Ownership changes to…

207
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:25.650
Sam: like a… yeah, I guess it would just turn it into, like, a fight for gas fees.

208
00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:33.470
david: Actually, it requires… this only happens if the attacker acquires the owner key.

209
00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:38.029
david: So, if the attacker doesn't have the owner key, then

210
00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.760
david: They would be not be able to…

211
00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.630
Sam: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.090
david: Awesome, yeah.

213
00:56:48.230 --> 00:57:01.720
david: It wouldn't be more of, like, a gas, because there is that time buffer, and within that time frame, the other side will have to flip it, and then, like, the ownership wouldn't be able to be transferred.

214
00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.540
Sam: Yeah, so the…

215
00:57:04.090 --> 00:57:07.129
Sam: The compromised key would remain the owner.

216
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:10.450
Sam: Basically, is the best case scenario there.

217
00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:13.560
david: Yep, that's right.

218
00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:14.420
Sam: Okay.

219
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:25.440
david: Because in the existing case, the compromised key can just switch the ownership.

220
00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:26.580
Sam: Exactly, yeah.

221
00:57:27.530 --> 00:57:28.880
Sam: Yeah. Cool.

222
00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.090
david: Thanks.

223
00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.019
Sam: Awesome, so that should merge, hopefully.

224
00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:38.139
Sam: Yeah, thanks for coming out, and I think that's about all the time we have for today, so…

225
00:57:38.570 --> 00:57:40.909
Sam: Talk to you all, next time I'm on.

226
00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:50.229
Pooja Ranjan: Right, and for the next time… next week, actually, we are going to have EIP editing office hour for EIPs only, but we will meet Sam.

227
00:57:50.430 --> 00:58:04.459
Pooja Ranjan: During the event that we are organizing, that is EIP Summit on 21st of November, so please check the agenda, you'll find the link. If you're around, you can come and meet us in person in the event, but Sam will be

228
00:58:04.460 --> 00:58:11.790
Pooja Ranjan: There, in order to answer any question, kind of AMA, and we'll be going through some of the author's questions during that call.

229
00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:16.469
Pooja Ranjan: So, yeah. Thank you, Sam, for joining, and everyone here for tuning in.

230
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:19.160
Sam: Take care.
