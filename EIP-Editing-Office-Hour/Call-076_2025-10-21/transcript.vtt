00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.880
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, good end there.

2
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.519
Gajinder Singh: Hi, Pooja, how are you?

3
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.150
Pooja Ranjan: Doing very well, thank you.

4
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.390
Pooja Ranjan: Vachendra, we won't be able to stream this meeting, but it will be recorded and uploaded right after the meeting.

5
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.039
Pooja Ranjan: And, I think…

6
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.670
Gajinder Singh: Some good.

7
00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.700
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, it will also be having summaries all by bot and things like that. We are working on automation of

8
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.959
Pooja Ranjan: You know, all protocol calls, so this is just an effort in that direction.

9
00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.640
Pooja Ranjan: Would you want to quickly check this?

10
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.880
Pooja Ranjan: Sharing permission, if it is working well for you.

11
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, that's what I'm checking.

12
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.039
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, I've shared the agenda in chat here.

13
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:25.230
Pooja Ranjan: Looks like it's working well, and I also see one of the first PRs merged. Anyway, so, Gajandra, I know we have a lot of open PRs.

14
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:45.120
Pooja Ranjan: But it wasn't very clear to me, like, how do we engage other PRs? Mostly, in draft category, they are there, so they are new. But because this is for core EIPs, I just have tried to put together a small list here, which is miscellaneous and some draft.

15
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.200
Pooja Ranjan: So, if we are done with this, we can perhaps take a look into the review from EIP board to address some of the issues.

16
00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.640
Pooja Ranjan: If you're good, maybe we can go ahead and get started with the meeting.

17
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.570
Gajinder Singh: Yep, let's.

18
00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.650
Pooja Ranjan: Alright.

19
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.130
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour. This is meeting number 76.

20
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:20.720
Pooja Ranjan: and is added on Ethereum PM repo with issue number 1775. On agenda, we have added only PRs which are related to EIPs.

21
00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:35.350
Pooja Ranjan: Like, from the EIP GitHub repository. We do have some proposals to review under Miscellaneous and a draft category, and once we are done with that, we can go ahead and take a look at the EIP board, if time permits.

22
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:46.300
Pooja Ranjan: People who have joined here on the call, if you are here for any particular EIP-related PR, please drop the link in the chat, and we can perhaps take a look.

23
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:59.900
Pooja Ranjan: Please be mindful in this meeting, we are only going to cover, EIP-related PRs. We won't be able to review ERCs, unfortunately. However, you can drop your PRs related to,

24
00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.479
Pooja Ranjan: ERC for the next meeting, which is on next Tuesday, and the issue number is 1776.

25
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:18.359
Pooja Ranjan: So yeah, thank you for joining. And Gajendra, thank you for joining us here. We can perhaps go ahead and get started with the first PR, which is in the miscellaneous status.

26
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.230
Pooja Ranjan: Not status, but under category of miscellaneous here for review.

27
00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:30.949
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, thanks, Wooja. Yeah, let's get started. So, I looked into both of these PRs, and

28
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.949
Gajinder Singh: So these PRs are regarding, some technical changes.

29
00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:39.270
Gajinder Singh: And, over here, Itan has already…

30
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:47.760
Gajinder Singh: responded, so… and I also added my comment, because this is my EIP as well, so I'm co-authoring it.

31
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:58.080
Gajinder Singh: So basically, this is technical stuff, and not under the purview of the IP editing. Similarly, this other AIP…

32
00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:04.220
Gajinder Singh: whose author I am. Again, it talks about some technical changes.

33
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.430
Gajinder Singh: And I have basically responded, that sort of… this sort of is not Correct.

34
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.100
Gajinder Singh: So we'll wait for author…

35
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.409
Gajinder Singh: We wait for the PR author to respond.

36
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.160
Gajinder Singh: But as such, again, this is not under the purview of AIP editing.

37
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:30.009
Gajinder Singh: The CIP, which was… this PR, which was sort of blocked.

38
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.200
Gajinder Singh: getting blocked from merging it, I basically…

39
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.670
Gajinder Singh: Restarted, all the CI actions, and it sort of merged.

40
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.730
Gajinder Singh: On the draft

41
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:53.859
Gajinder Singh: We're coming to the draft, the new EIPs. This EIP, I was able to approve.

42
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.809
Gajinder Singh: So it is now merged and is a draft EIP.

43
00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.890
Gajinder Singh: Let's look into the PR10554.

44
00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.989
Gajinder Singh: I also looked into this, and

45
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.020
Gajinder Singh: Basically, have raised some pointers, which…

46
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:16.519
Gajinder Singh: Author can review and sort of address them, and when they do.

47
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:21.289
Gajinder Singh: We'll again come back and, review this.

48
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.080
Gajinder Singh: Going to the next… PR for a new EIP.

49
00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:40.310
Gajinder Singh: So, I think, oh.

50
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:47.039
Gajinder Singh: Andrew already provided an EIP number, which author has not yet updated.

51
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.610
Gajinder Singh: So we'll wait for author to do the updates, and…

52
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.970
Gajinder Singh: get the CI passing, and then we can basically…

53
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.239
Gajinder Singh: do some review, although I did some review, and again.

54
00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:05.360
Gajinder Singh: There is, there is quite a lot, of code that has been bundled. It's a Python code.

55
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:10.320
Gajinder Singh: And, so, Pujab, maybe we should again…

56
00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:19.720
Gajinder Singh: put this issue into EIP IP meeting, that, what is the best way to handle reference implementations, because obviously we don't want them

57
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:29.189
Gajinder Singh: to, we don't want them in our EIP repo, because it will make it unnecessarily bulky, and obviously we don't…

58
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:38.199
Gajinder Singh: want any active code… I mean, we don't want… we want pseudocode as code reference, but we don't want any,

59
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:40.219
Gajinder Singh: Active reference code.

60
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:43.719
Gajinder Singh: That, that is in our…

61
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.310
Gajinder Singh: EIP repo, because we don't want to sort of distribute it, we don't want to become an agent.

62
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:55.629
Gajinder Singh: to distribute this code, with our, through our EIP repo.

63
00:08:55.810 --> 00:09:01.560
Gajinder Singh: So, this is something, we should basically discussing EIP IP.

64
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:16.590
Gajinder Singh: Yeah. And I have also referred to the author that maybe if they can refer to the code in a very high-level pseudocode, that is actually better when you are trying to explain concepts, which is what EIP process is all about.

65
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:34.329
Pooja Ranjan: That's right, that's nice. Actually, we kind of briefly discussed this in the last EIP EIP meeting. I believe, you had pointed out another similar PR where the author was trying to make Fellowship of Ethereum Magician as a placeholder for reference implementation.

66
00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:41.230
Pooja Ranjan: It seems Sam disagrees to the idea, because again, Fellowship of Ethereum Magician is,

67
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:48.959
Pooja Ranjan: It's something that can be open for forever, and it will keep on changing. So, he disagrees to have that.

68
00:09:49.420 --> 00:10:02.409
Pooja Ranjan: link being added as reference implementation, but I'm happy to put, PR number 10557, as you mentioned, again, in the next EIPIP meeting. Maybe we can come up with some different solution to have reference implementation added.

69
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:13.880
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, and I think there is one particular ERC that… I'm not sure whether it got merged or not, but again, it was sort of raised by Josh Rudolph.

70
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:18.499
Gajinder Singh: Where they wanted to link a reference implementation again,

71
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:29.330
Gajinder Singh: which is how I was suggesting them that, okay, you know, refer them in your Ethereum Magician's link, but that Magician's link also doesn't work, because the bot sort of flags it.

72
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:32.600
Gajinder Singh: anywhere except discussions too, so…

73
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.429
Gajinder Singh: In that sense, yes, we need to sort of find a proper solution for it.

74
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:41.790
Gajinder Singh: How to best add… the code reference.

75
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:50.050
Gajinder Singh: if we can, for this particular… I think we can discuss this further in EIP IP, but if we can, for example, just allow

76
00:10:50.380 --> 00:11:02.720
Gajinder Singh: GitHub code references with a fixed commit number, any GitHub code reference with a fixed commit number. In the reference implementation section, I think that would

77
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.110
Gajinder Singh: be the best way to deal with it, but I guess we can talk about in…

78
00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:09.490
Gajinder Singh: about it in EIPI permitting.

79
00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:20.369
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, that sounds good. Yes, the idea of not adding a Fellowship of Ethereum Magician in the body of the EIB, we do have it in the preamble, but that's fine, but not in the part of body.

80
00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:31.879
Gajinder Singh: Right. Moving to the… Okay, this was covered.

81
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:36.880
Gajinder Singh: Moving to the next, new EIP proposal.

82
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:47.640
Gajinder Singh: So, I have… I assigned the IP number, and it seems like author has… Were they sort of fixing?

83
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:55.370
Gajinder Singh: the PR, and when the author will be done, and it will be all green, then I will give it a review.

84
00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.310
Pooja Ranjan: Sounds good.

85
00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.580
Gajinder Singh: Alright, so, what do we want to do now with a review from the AIP board?

86
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:24.999
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, perhaps we can take a look at the EIP board. I understand that we have a lot of open PRs, but most of the PRs there are in either typo-fixing category. I understand where, until we get response from the author, it doesn't make sense to be added in editor's review list, so I left it as is.

87
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:31.189
Pooja Ranjan: We can perhaps look into, yeah, some of the old PRs from here.

88
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:42.069
Gajinder Singh: Now, would you like to, sort of, take on the control and for the viewing section? Because I don't understand where to go.

89
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:45.590
Gajinder Singh: Should I filter something over here?

90
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:58.799
Pooja Ranjan: So, there is, this… if you scroll up a little bit, there would be, download report, so you can just perhaps download report, and that will give us a complete list of all proposals which are added there.

91
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.460
Gajinder Singh: So, is the report visible as well?

92
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:17.459
Pooja Ranjan: It is not, but it is in the same sequence as you can see it here in the serial number mentioned.

93
00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.500
Pooja Ranjan: So you can click the view PR from here with the same serial number.

94
00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.880
Gajinder Singh: Oh, okay.

95
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.600
Gajinder Singh: So, the 9354, this was a new PR, I think.

96
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.870
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, it's the first one, yes.

97
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:59.270
Pooja Ranjan: I believe this is long pending. BOMA added something, but we never heard back from the… Otter?

98
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:00.889
Pooja Ranjan: the proposer…

99
00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.679
Gajinder Singh: Right, but if this isn't passing and author is not addressing it, I mean…

100
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.480
Gajinder Singh: Yep. It is sort of not on…

101
00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:15.660
Gajinder Singh: It is not on our onus to sort of push it forward.

102
00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:28.509
Pooja Ranjan: Right, yeah, so that is… that is the reason why I was, like, mentioning this before. Like, there are so many PRs, but those PRs are not pending on editors.

103
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:44.219
Pooja Ranjan: They are pending on authors or the proposals. So, a lot of proposals are just there for review. For example, the next one, 9395, I believe it is waiting on some conflict resolution that can only be done by the EIP author.

104
00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.180
Gajinder Singh: Oh, this is Tim, I think.

105
00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.419
Gajinder Singh: He's sort of one of our…

106
00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.530
Pooja Ranjan: Now we can even add, I guess,

107
00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:05.970
Pooja Ranjan: 7569 new… I think Alex is also co-author now, right?

108
00:15:07.980 --> 00:15:08.910
Gajinder Singh: Yes.

109
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:16.689
Gajinder Singh: I mean, if he proposes a PR, we'll basically

110
00:15:17.330 --> 00:15:20.179
Gajinder Singh: sort of add him a co-author and accept him as well, yeah.

111
00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:26.360
Pooja Ranjan: But… But I see him as a co-author right now, so…

112
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.670
Gajinder Singh: Note on all the PRs.

113
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:29.390
Pooja Ranjan: Okay.

114
00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:34.929
Gajinder Singh: So, for example, this particular…

115
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.070
Pooja Ranjan: Yep.

116
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.110
Pooja Ranjan: So now, what is the idea? How do we move forward?

117
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:45.640
Gajinder Singh: So…

118
00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.590
Pooja Ranjan: Because we know students are not going to be available for some time.

119
00:15:53.680 --> 00:16:00.119
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, I think we… should just bring it to the attention of Alex, I guess.

120
00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.940
Gajinder Singh: Okay. At least where we know that, you know.

121
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.870
Gajinder Singh: Who's the person in charge for these.

122
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.220
Pooja Ranjan: be honest.

123
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:09.759
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, right, right, that is a good idea.

124
00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:17.110
Pooja Ranjan: I believe Rohan has a question, comment. Rohan, you want to add something?

125
00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:26.300
Rohan iPhone: Yeah, this is just a general comment on the EIPERC process, like, submitting one.

126
00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:31.819
Rohan iPhone: I think, like, I just heard you mention, like, you know, how the onus isn't on…

127
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:48.510
Rohan iPhone: you guys, as the reviewers, like, if, like, you know, there's certain format issues and things like that, which I totally agree on, right, because you're not the ones writing the ERC, I think that totally makes sense, but there is no documentation, on, like, the process or even, like, the format or anything, like.

128
00:16:48.510 --> 00:17:02.579
Rohan iPhone: we had… we struggled, and, like, you know, we worked with David, who's, like, you know, like, heading all the AI stuff at Ethereum, and we worked with him. He said, like, you know, this is great, like, you know, you should submit it, and then it took us, like, over a week

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:20.410
Rohan iPhone: just to get information on, you know, like, what the correct, like, formatting was, you know, how, like, the different tests were structured. There's, like, a bunch of other, like, small issues that weren't really described anywhere, and I guess I'm just wondering, like, is there a reason there's no documentation that exists on how to create these proposals, or…

130
00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:22.419
Rohan iPhone: Is it just that, you know.

131
00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:34.330
Rohan iPhone: like, everyone's just expected to figure it out on their own, because I think… I think it would just be much more efficient, you know, if there's, like, some place on the magician's side that said, like, you know, this is how you should be,

132
00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:46.830
Rohan iPhone: submitting your PRs, because ERC1 describes how the proposals, like, should be made, and, like, what kinds of things should be in it, but the PR is, like, where most people get stuck, and there isn't really documentation there.

133
00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:56.179
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, I mean, the reason for that would be, I mean, there is no hard and fast,

134
00:17:56.390 --> 00:18:00.679
Gajinder Singh: Format, in the sense that, basically, you have to describe your idea and

135
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:05.480
Gajinder Singh: It should fit into the very high-level format that we enforce.

136
00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.870
Gajinder Singh: by…

137
00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:16.080
Gajinder Singh: you know, providing the headers, right? So this is why we provide the headers, this is why we have the bots, so that at least, you know, that is the basic thing.

138
00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:23.229
Gajinder Singh: that we can enforce, and apart from that, I think it's more about… whether your PR…

139
00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:29.320
Gajinder Singh: Is sort of, you know, expressing it, expressing your idea properly or not.

140
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:38.470
Gajinder Singh: Right. Is there something that you think can be structured? I mean, that would be sort of helpful. If you have some points, then…

141
00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.970
Rohan iPhone: Sure.

142
00:18:38.970 --> 00:18:55.340
Gajinder Singh: We can discuss it in EIP IP meeting, and so our way of doing things would be, can we sort of, you know, add these, tests, add these checks in the bot itself, because bot is like a…

143
00:18:55.430 --> 00:19:10.590
Gajinder Singh: very, you know, iterative way of giving feedback, right? So you do something and board doesn't pass, so it will tell you why it didn't pass as well. So, in that sense, I think, that is the best way to deal about it, but apart from that.

144
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:21.180
Gajinder Singh: if you think that there are some examples that can be created, but, I mean, all the ERCs that are out there are sort of examples only, or EIPs that are out there are sort of examples.

145
00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:28.539
Gajinder Singh: But what is exactly that, you know, for example, so what are your exact suggestions, like.

146
00:19:29.530 --> 00:19:44.469
Rohan iPhone: Yeah, I mean, I can definitely, like, write something and maybe, like, you know, said that, or however that works, but I think it's actually to do with the test cases themselves. Like, this was something I heard from a few other people as well, and we encountered during, like, while we were submitting.

147
00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:56.170
Rohan iPhone: the… the test, right? Like, there's a lot of times where certain ones fail, and, like, specifically that one with the… where it, like, you know, generates the HTML that is gonna actually publish on…

148
00:19:56.170 --> 00:20:13.830
Rohan iPhone: the main ERC site, right? And that has, like, a bunch of different checks for, you know, like, are all… anytime there's, like, an ERC mentioned, is it, like, hyperlinked correctly to the, like, the ERC within the repo? There are, like, a few other, like, formatting things, like, there's, like, very specific items that…

149
00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:20.920
Rohan iPhone: aren't documented anywhere, but they're in the tests. So I think, like, if there's something clear saying, like, okay, you know, these…

150
00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:35.700
Rohan iPhone: these are all the tests, and this is exactly, like, what they're looking for, and that's just, like, you know, like, posted as, like, documentation somewhere, even on the GitHub, whether it's the README or somewhere else. That would be really helpful, because that test takes almost 20 minutes to run.

151
00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:54.280
Rohan iPhone: And, like, every time there's, like, one or two, like, small things, right? You wait 20 minutes, and then you see, like, oh, there's, like, some error, but there's no docs on it, right? So you didn't even know that that was, like, a formatting thing that you had to do. And then you have to, like, rerun and make a new commit, and, like, wait another 20 minutes. So I think that's, like, the main issue, probably.

152
00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:00.810
Gajinder Singh: I think… I believe you can run that test locally as well, so…

153
00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:07.060
Gajinder Singh: There must be some command, I'm sure there is a command that you can run locally, and…

154
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:11.960
Gajinder Singh: verify that, you know, your PR passes those tests.

155
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.410
Gajinder Singh: So you don't have to wait on the CI for that.

156
00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:28.520
Gajinder Singh: But as such, the general rules are already there, because we don't add anything into CI test unless, you know, we have documented it on EIP1 or ERC1, right? So…

157
00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:28.970
Rohan iPhone: Hmm.

158
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:36.190
Gajinder Singh: Are… are those things not present in EIP1 and ERC1? Is my question, then.

159
00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:41.689
Rohan iPhone: I think one or two of them, it's just not… it's not very clear, but…

160
00:21:41.730 --> 00:22:01.189
Rohan iPhone: I mean, I can, you know, I can make a PR for this, where I just, like, update the README, right? And make a PR saying, like, okay, here's, like, these extra docs, just so, like… there's, like, one spot where someone can see all them, right? Rather than, like, having to dig through the… like, the full, like, the entire full documentation. Since, like, you know, at least, like, the CI, whether you're running locally or…

161
00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:13.640
Rohan iPhone: like, you know, directly on the actual repo, you know, it would all just be in, like, one place. So, I mean, I could do that, but I don't know how long that will take to approve either, right? So, it's not… it's not that…

162
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:22.399
Rohan iPhone: See, I don't actually know, right? Because there's so much on, like, the ERC1 that certain, like, small things, maybe they got missed, but…

163
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:33.410
Rohan iPhone: it's… I guess it's just, like, not clear document. Anyways, I don't want to waste your time, but, yeah, I think maybe, like, if it was all condensed and, like, at least for the tests in one spot in the repo, that would help a lot of people, that's all.

164
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:42.280
Gajinder Singh: So, I guess what you are trying to say is that maybe we have one example which has all the features

165
00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:43.609
Gajinder Singh: that we support.

166
00:22:44.130 --> 00:22:48.529
Gajinder Singh: And the CI passes, so that, you know, people can look at it and see.

167
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:53.829
Gajinder Singh: Whether they are consistent with it or not. I think that that could probably work, and

168
00:22:53.990 --> 00:23:01.700
Gajinder Singh: Maybe, Pooja, yes, we can add this in our EIP IP agenda, that if we can… generate, art…

169
00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:05.240
Gajinder Singh: a sample, EIP or DRC.

170
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:09.579
Gajinder Singh: Where all the features are present, and

171
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:13.219
Gajinder Singh: people can sort of use to replicate, I guess that would be helpful.

172
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.470
Rohan iPhone: Yeah, that would be awesome, yeah.

173
00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:29.399
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, sure, we can definitely add it, but Rohan, as you suggested, it would be a good idea to have a PR with respect to whatever changes you are talking about. And one more thing, like, I would like to add, you mentioned ERC1 multiple times.

174
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:40.050
Pooja Ranjan: I'm not very confident that ERC1 is being actively maintained. When the repo split happened, ERC1 was made as a copy of EIP1.

175
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:59.799
Pooja Ranjan: Generally speaking, we do not have a duplicate number for any of the EIP, ERC, and even for RIP, so my recommendation would be to please follow EIP1 instead of ERC1. You would find everything related to ERC's documentation and available in EIP1 as well.

176
00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:10.930
Pooja Ranjan: So even in future, if we want to add some recommendations that could be helpful for many other authors to document their proposal, perhaps we should make it in the EIP1, rather than going to ERC1.

177
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:31.330
Rohan iPhone: Yeah, that makes sense. I know you guys changed it too, so I think that also might be part of the confusion. Like, all, you know, like, all these, like, small things, like, notes like these, like, that we should use the EIP one for both ERC and EIP, if that's, like, all in that Git repo somewhere, like, with the sample and, like, some notes or something, I think… yeah, like you said, like, that would probably…

178
00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.180
Rohan iPhone: be really helpful. So, yeah, that makes sense.

179
00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:36.540
Rohan iPhone: Thank you, yeah.

180
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.660
Gajinder Singh: Cool.

181
00:24:41.810 --> 00:24:44.629
Gajinder Singh: Yep, hi, Ben.

182
00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:49.680
Gajinder Singh: Do you want to bring something up, or you just wanted us to bring your EIP in focus?

183
00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:55.620
Ben Adams: Just to bring the EIP in focus, really, because,

184
00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.939
Ben Adams: Ideally, I'd like to add it to…

185
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:03.529
Ben Adams: The Meta EIP, which is the…

186
00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:08.740
Ben Adams: 8007, which is the Glamsterdam Glamster Dam.

187
00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:10.250
Ben Adams: Gas repricing.

188
00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:21.580
Ben Adams: No, I'd like to get it on the… Agenda with other photos.

189
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.430
Gajinder Singh: So, I think.

190
00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.910
Pooja Ranjan: 10579.

191
00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:30.499
Ben Adams: Yeah, it's the last one.

192
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:41.190
Gajinder Singh: No, there is some CIs still failing.

193
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:42.890
Ben Adams: Let me look it up.

194
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.110
Ben Adams: Yeah, it's just the external image link.

195
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.589
Ben Adams: I didn't update the APN.

196
00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:58.910
Ben Adams: For some reason.

197
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.830
Ben Adams: So, right.

198
00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.030
Ben Adams: Push that.

199
00:26:23.730 --> 00:26:25.630
Ben Adams: Okay, that should be fixed.

200
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:56.010
Gajinder Singh: When is it possible that we don't do our own indentation over here in terms of new lines? Because…

201
00:26:56.410 --> 00:27:02.389
Gajinder Singh: You know, then… the HTML renderer would basically be able to render it

202
00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:07.160
Gajinder Singh: I guess it would still be able to render it properly, but

203
00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:14.399
Gajinder Singh: I mean, I prefer that you don't add any new lines yourself, so that.

204
00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.250
Ben Adams: So solo one…

205
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:17.859
Gajinder Singh: You are covered, yeah.

206
00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:19.640
Ben Adams: Yep.

207
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:24.919
Gajinder Singh: Unless it's… unless you are sort of doing a new line and sort of separating out the paragraph.

208
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:27.160
Ben Adams: Yeah.

209
00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.280
Ben Adams: Understood.

210
00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.490
Ben Adams: That's easy enough to change.

211
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:19.820
Ben Adams: One… one thing I wasn't… Entirely sure, but… That, I think, is correct.

212
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:22.230
Ben Adams: I suppose I could just look at other VIPs.

213
00:28:22.390 --> 00:28:32.410
Ben Adams: So we're focused on… The idea of providing test cases.

214
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:39.290
Ben Adams: But that… It doesn't really…

215
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:45.789
Ben Adams: seem to fit into a specific… I don't know if it's security considerations that goes in.

216
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:50.300
Gajinder Singh: Can you sort of also add with language? This is, like, how we do…

217
00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:53.320
Gajinder Singh: triple dash Python or something like that, I guess.

218
00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:56.970
Gajinder Singh: No, this is just… Totally pseudocode.

219
00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.299
Ben Adams: Yeah, that's just sort of pseudocode math, so…

220
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.179
Ben Adams: I've got two… two sections. The first one is…

221
00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:13.000
Ben Adams: Like, the maths that deals with it in, Floating point numbers.

222
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:19.970
Ben Adams: And then a second section, which is… Interest, because we don't… Like, flights in place.

223
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:56.199
Ben Adams: That's fair. And also, yeah, power of 3, and…

224
00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.750
Gajinder Singh: Yeah, what exactly were you saying for the test cases, Ben?

225
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:41.009
Ben Adams: I wasn't sure where it lived. I have it under security considerations, but I don't know if there's an…

226
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.890
Ben Adams: Yeah.

227
00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:51.169
Ben Adams: Because, the… you'll get a linting error if you add your own section.

228
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.450
Ben Adams: I suppose there's specification, maybe.

229
00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:13.380
Ben Adams: Bear.

230
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:16.359
Ben Adams: I think I've answered my own question.

231
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:24.370
Gajinder Singh: Yep, so what exactly do you want to do over here?

232
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:40.010
Ben Adams: Oh, I moved test cases into… and… Reference implementation… Up into specification, rather than… Rather than in spirit.

233
00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:50.580
Gajinder Singh: I think we don't have any specific format to provide for test cases,

234
00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:55.780
Gajinder Singh: And yes, reference implementation, I think this is fine on a very high level.

235
00:34:00.210 --> 00:34:05.210
Gajinder Singh: Do you want to provide a very deep ref… Deep reference implementation?

236
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:07.060
Gajinder Singh: Well, this is fine.

237
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:13.120
Ben Adams: This is fine. I'm only providing it because,

238
00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:19.970
Ben Adams: There are potential rounding issues, and that would cause, consensus problems.

239
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:27.049
Ben Adams: Just to… The exact on how to… how to round.

240
00:34:28.330 --> 00:34:29.130
Ben Adams: I think…

241
00:34:29.130 --> 00:34:37.469
Gajinder Singh: You can… you can just even move this to the spec… you know, You can move this,

242
00:34:37.610 --> 00:34:41.620
Gajinder Singh: To the spec itself, so you don't need them in the reference implementation, because

243
00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.330
Gajinder Singh: Reference implementation is, like, you know, quite a…

244
00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:49.510
Gajinder Singh: Complete kind of implementation, where everything else is present.

245
00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:56.260
Gajinder Singh: So I guess you can also move it to the spec, because… That would sort of,

246
00:34:56.610 --> 00:35:00.359
Gajinder Singh: Properly define the functions and the rounding things, right?

247
00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.850
Ben Adams: Yes, yup.

248
00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:06.079

249
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:12.229
Gajinder Singh: done some of the changes, that I asked for. Let me just leave a comment.

250

Pooja Ranjan: Very well,

258
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:27.659
Pooja Ranjan: In the meantime, I took liberty to take a look at the EIP board, and there are 36 PRs which are listed, and most of them are on consensus side, like an editor's consensus, which I don't think we will be in a position to review it here today, and some of them are typo, which, again, are waiting on author's response in order to move forward.

259
00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:41.629
Pooja Ranjan: The proposals which were added as draft has already been reviewed by you, Gajendar. I think in less than an hour, I saw comments on each one of them, so I believe we are good for today. Today's agenda, like, the PRs which are there for review is all.

260
00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:43.630
Pooja Ranjan: Taken care of.

261
00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:46.940
Gajinder Singh: Yep, I guess we can.

262
00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.170
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

263
00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.900
Gajinder Singh: Finish up this session.

264
