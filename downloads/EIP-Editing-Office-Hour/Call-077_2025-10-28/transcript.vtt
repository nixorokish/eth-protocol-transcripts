00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.079
German - EVVM.org: Hola, hola, hola, hola.

2
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:54.160
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, gentlemen.

3
00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.590
German - EVVM.org: Hello, how are you?

4
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:05.999
Pooja Ranjan: Doing well. I think I'm seeing you for the first time. You're the same, are you talking to me, right?

5
00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:09.749
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, yes, it's me. I guess.

6
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:17.139
German - EVVM.org: We met in… I… I think, we met in Delhi, in the… it global, it's possible.

7
00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:27.579
German - EVVM.org: You were there? No, not there in person, but my understanding is you were on Discord's server a while ago, because I remember this handle. This is a unique handle, and I remember it.

8
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:32.210
German - EVVM.org: Are you talking to me? Yes. You know?

9
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.940
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

10
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:41.650
German - EVVM.org: Is that what it means, is, are you talking to me? So, yes, yes, I was in other calls, but also.

11
00:09:42.150 --> 00:10:04.960
German - EVVM.org: I was asking you a few years ago, and past year also, because I had other proposals in my mind. I didn't draft them on the Ethereum machines. And I'm continuing working on them, because, you know, I take this very seriously, so,

12
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:10.109
German - EVVM.org: I… I was asking some guidance from you.

13
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:15.139
German - EVVM.org: And you gave it to me in the Discord, and also in messages.

14
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:25.229
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, that makes sense. So I understand, we are here for perhaps 8003 today, are you planning to get it merged? Because I did not find that proposal on…

15
00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.709
Pooja Ranjan: The list, like, in draft status just yet.

16
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:43.929
German - EVVM.org: is in drafts, you added into the drafts many times already, but I could connect now, that's why I, I, I, I wrote you. Let me show you.

17
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.050
Pooja Ranjan: Sean?

18
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.630
German - EVVM.org: echo.

19
00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:52.610
Pooja Ranjan: No worries. I mean, we will take a look at it when the editor is… is, online, like, he's yet to join.

20
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.860
Pooja Ranjan: No, I don't think it has been merged yet.

21
00:10:56.250 --> 00:11:04.179
Pooja Ranjan: By any chance, do you have the PR link handy? If you can drop it in the chat, we will try to take that, the first proposal for discussion today.

22
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:07.620
German - EVVM.org: Yes, give me one second, please.

23
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.940
Pooja Ranjan: Sure.

24
00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.700
German - EVVM.org: So, how is everything prepared in Argentina? Have you been there before?

25
00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:44.020
Pooja Ranjan: been to South America, not to Argentina in specific, so it's first time, but I have added you to the list, and yeah, that should be good. If you're good with the title, we should keep that.

26
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.650
German - EVVM.org: Yes, yes, I like it. Yes.

27
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:53.599
Pooja Ranjan: And it would be a pleasure to hear from someone who is trying to make the first

28
00:11:54.170 --> 00:12:00.279
Pooja Ranjan: EIP in, because people sometimes have challenges, I believe your talk could be inspiring for many other authors.

29
00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:02.950
German - EVVM.org: Yes.

30
00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:13.499
German - EVVM.org: I guess so. That's why I… I take the lead to… to send this… this proposal. Let me send in the chat the link.

31
00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:16.270
German - EVVM.org: You can see…

32
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:23.340
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, the… Hmm.

33
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.300
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, so that has been tagged multiple times, it's just that we never got a chance to merge it.

34
00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:37.040
Pooja Ranjan: Which, I believe we should be in a position to do that today.

35
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:39.730
Pooja Ranjan: Cool.

36
00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:41.279
Pooja Ranjan: Let's wait for…

37
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.440
German - EVVM.org: It's okay, excellent.

38
00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.490
Pooja Ranjan: Fine, yeah.

39
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.820
German - EVVM.org: I'm excited about this.

40
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:50.300
Pooja Ranjan: Sure.

41
00:12:51.070 --> 00:12:52.580
Pooja Ranjan: Let me quickly ping him.

42
00:12:53.650 --> 00:13:00.020
German - EVVM.org: Good. I'm, by the way, I'm from Uruguay, so, have you been in Uruguay?

43
00:13:00.810 --> 00:13:06.739
Pooja Ranjan: No, I think… No, neither? No, I went to Ecuador last time.

44
00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:09.179
German - EVVM.org: That's nice. Quito?

45
00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.789
Pooja Ranjan: Yep, I lived there for a few years.

46
00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:13.590
German - EVVM.org: Oh.

47
00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.290
Pooja Ranjan: Hablas espanol.

48
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.710
Pooja Ranjan: Poco, poco espanol.

49
00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:21.430
German - EVVM.org: That'd be nice.

50
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.720
German - EVVM.org: Okay, more people arrived.

51
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:26.240
Pooja Ranjan: Right.

52
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.350
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome, Rajit. Welcome, John.

53
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:38.290
Pooja Ranjan: Should you have any PR that you would want to be reviewed today, and you have questions for editors, please feel free to drop the link in the chat, and we will take it in the order.

54
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:44.950
Rajat K Wasan: Yeah, hey Pooja. No, I just wanted to, let you know that there were some comments on ERC7518.

55
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:50.740
Rajat K Wasan: So, that feedback is still in progress, so I just don't want to include this in this QR code here.

56
00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:59.949
Pooja Ranjan: By in progress, you mean that you have acted upon it, and you would want auditors to take a second look?

57
00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:04.109
Rajat K Wasan: I mean, like, we haven't acted yet, so we are working on it, so…

58
00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:07.060
Pooja Ranjan: We are working on it. Cool, that makes sense. No worries, thank you.

59
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:20.729
Pooja Ranjan: Editor should be here in a couple of minutes, he just pinged, he's trying to connect.

60
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.450
Pooja Ranjan: Hey Victor, thank you for joining.

61
00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hey, how are you?

62
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:56.060
Pooja Ranjan: Doing very well. Would you want to check your screen sharing permission, if it is working well?

63
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:58.920
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, let me take a look.

64
00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.660
Zainan Victor Zhou: One second…

65
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.819
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you give me the, GitHub EIP?

66
00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:35.600
Zainan Victor Zhou: repository link, for the EIP to be reviewed today.

67
00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.819
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I've just shared in the chat the agenda list.

68
00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.880
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, now let me share my screen.

69
00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:44.880
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you see my screen?

70
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.109
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, we can see it.

71
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:48.150
Pooja Ranjan: And it is visible.

72
00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:53.410
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, we are all set. Akash, please move over the screen.

73
00:16:00.090 --> 00:16:09.469
Pooja Ranjan: Welcome to EIP Editing Office Hour. This is meeting number 77, and in this meeting, we are going to include EIP plus ERC pull requests.

74
00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:20.269
Pooja Ranjan: We are joined by Editor Victor, and he's gonna go through the proposal. We are also joined by a few authors who have their proposal listed for agenda today.

75
00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:30.160
Pooja Ranjan: So, Victor, welcome, and perhaps we can begin with the first PR, which is 1158 on ERC repository.

76
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:36.150
Pooja Ranjan: We have the author joined by that, and let's try to answer the questions of the authors first.

77
00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:50.189
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, this is a ERC20 print initialization extension with, Sentinel, storage.

78
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:56.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: And I think the intention was to, include it emerge as a draft.

79
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.509
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me double check…

80
00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:05.939
Pooja Ranjan: That's correct, and we are joined by the author, German, in case you have any question for him, or if you want to quickly check anything.

81
00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.239
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hi, German, thanks for coming.

82
00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:12.620
German - EVVM.org: Hello, thanks for taking time to review my proposal.

83
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes.

84
00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:24.369
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, pre… an option function. Okay, let's take a look at what this function is.

85
00:17:24.770 --> 00:17:32.379
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's a pre-initialized address, and what is the implementation? What is the reason for that?

86
00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:35.570
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

87
00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:41.440
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, that's an interesting idea.

88
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:50.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: Which means you can preload Some of the storage.

89
00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: And save a lot of gas.

90
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.129
Zainan Victor Zhou: Nice, and even including the recommendation implementation.

91
00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:12.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: Look pretty neat. Let me quickly take a look at the… at the specialized specification. This is… must store…

92
00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:13.860
Zainan Victor Zhou: Balance.

93
00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.049
Zainan Victor Zhou: S… Mapping address to bind… byte 32.

94
00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:22.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, provide a public external function.

95
00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:44.619
German - EVVM.org: I also provided a solidity code already working, and made tests with on-chain transactions to prove it, and also I provided a calculator to estimate in real time how much are you going to

96
00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:52.380
German - EVVM.org: To save in gas. All these links are in the Ethereum Magician, post.

97
00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:54.940
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

98
00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:56.570
Zainan Victor Zhou: Nice.

99
00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:02.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: I am a big fan of providing reference implementation.

100
00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:05.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, let's take a look at this.

101
00:19:05.490 --> 00:19:14.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: with what user is for. Okay, it gives user… Some kind of magic number.

102
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:17.539
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's a magic value.

103
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:34.829
German - EVVM.org: Number is a string. This is very important, because for safety and accountant redundancy, we can't use numbers, because if not, we will have problems. If we use one or a high number, the accountant of the token will be break… broken.

104
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:44.349
German - EVVM.org: So it's, it's not a number, it's a string. That… that is the… the… the… the hacky, the tricky part here is storing as bytes.

105
00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:55.980
German - EVVM.org: but representing as UINT for the interfaces, so it's standard. The wallets and the users shouldn't do anything new.

106
00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:59.740
German - EVVM.org: Just this is an internal, procedure.

107
00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:01.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: I see.

108
00:20:02.410 --> 00:20:07.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: Cool. Let me see… so this user will be assigned for…

109
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:12.449
Zainan Victor Zhou: A magic number, and what's the relationship between

110
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:19.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: In this particular implementation, what's the relationship between balance by 32 and allowance?

111
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see…

112
00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:39.110
German - EVVM.org: The implementation, in general, is the same. The thing here is that we are pre-initializing with a byte. It's not a magic number, it's a byte, so it's a string.

113
00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:57.049
German - EVVM.org: And this is not interpreted never by a number, that's why this couldn't have a problem with the representation on the accountant of the token in general, with the balance, general balance, and issuance, and neither with the user's balance.

114
00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:08.999
German - EVVM.org: Because this string is handled as 0, because it's zero on number representation, a string. But in the interfaces.

115
00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:21.210
German - EVVM.org: Nothing changes. So in the interfaces, to know the balance of a user, to do transfers, or whatever else, or mint, it goes to a number, because a byte 32 can have a number inside.

116
00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:37.579
German - EVVM.org: And this will work as the same than if it was a UINT. So, if we pre-initialize with a zero value, we are not saving anything, because zero to non-zero caused the full gas.

117
00:21:37.770 --> 00:21:44.450
German - EVVM.org: So, when we pre-initialize with bytes, the bytes to a number cost a quarter part of gas.

118
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:57.960
German - EVVM.org: Because you already have data there, and you are just reutilizing the slot. The SS storage will take, like, 5,000 units of gas in place of 20,000 units. And in the…

119
00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:05.520
German - EVVM.org: in the implementation in Ethereum Magicians, I, I also wrote and published a calculator

120
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:09.049
German - EVVM.org: That you can use to check all the things.

121
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:09.870
German - EVVM.org: Likewise.

122
00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:10.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: calculator.

123
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you share the link to the copy?

124
00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:17.350
German - EVVM.org: machines, Indian machines. And also.

125
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:18.929
Zainan Victor Zhou: He's magicians, okay.

126
00:22:18.930 --> 00:22:20.580
German - EVVM.org: made machines.

127
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.429
German - EVVM.org: There is… I can't, should I reshare the link? Okay.

128
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:28.909
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, let me see if this is the eats musician, right?

129
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.590
German - EVVM.org: Yes, it is.

130
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:47.920
German - EVVM.org: Also, there is some discussion for a user that has confirmed some security concerns that were answered.

131
00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:52.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: Would you be worried about overflow, data overflow?

132
00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.559
German - EVVM.org: No, no, there will be no chance in this case.

133
00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:08.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: So let's say we happen to have a magic number that is That is very large.

134
00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: in… The deal.

135
00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.640
German - EVVM.org: By the implementation, it's not by the user.

136
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:23.009
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is generate… this is, implement implementation specific, right?

137
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:24.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: I know.

138
00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: this is implementation-specific, but what I wonder is, let's say someone got initialized with a big number.

139
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:44.080
Zainan Victor Zhou: And then, by the way, you're only initializing one user, right? From the interface I see, this function was called with only one user, right?

140
00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:51.709
German - EVVM.org: For each user, yes, in the line 19, you have where the magic value.

141
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.350
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes?

142
00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.070
German - EVVM.org: Great.

143
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:59.360
German - EVVM.org: And then you use it for every user. For every user that wants to pre-initialize, They call…

144
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:05.499
Zainan Victor Zhou: For every user. Okay, so for every user, which means if a user…

145
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:12.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: let's say I haven't been the ERC20

146
00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:23.759
Zainan Victor Zhou: let's say your token is called German token, and it's an ERC 8003 compliant token contract.

147
00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:31.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: And German… Your own account already has been… pre-initialized.

148
00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:37.179
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, I… like, I'm a new person, you want to interact with me, you want to transfer some…

149
00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:38.670
Zainan Victor Zhou: Token to me.

150
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:50.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: Does this function get called again, or does the pre-initialized address get called on my account as address again, or does it get called,

151
00:24:52.130 --> 00:25:03.229
Zainan Victor Zhou: does it not get called? I'm a little bit puzzled here, because I couldn't see where the pre-initialized is called for every user, when you say every user.

152
00:25:03.650 --> 00:25:20.389
German - EVVM.org: The pre-initialize is optional, so you are up to pre-initialize. It's an option, it's like, let's call it an ex… a plugin, an extension, a module, that if you add to your ERC20 contract, users can go

153
00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:36.740
German - EVVM.org: in advance, pre-initialize their addresses prior to a potential gas spike. So this is up to each user, it's not mandatory. Users, doesn't need to pre-initialize to use it. The implementation…

154
00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:37.350
Zainan Victor Zhou: Optional.

155
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:41.259
German - EVVM.org: It's optional. It's optional for each user.

156
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:49.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: I mean, some of the user may choose to pre-initialize their address, some may choose not to do so.

157
00:25:49.880 --> 00:26:01.160
German - EVVM.org: Exactly. And also, the wallets, in example, if I have a wallet and want to give a better performance for my users, I can

158
00:26:01.670 --> 00:26:20.619
German - EVVM.org: sponsor this pre-initialization. I don't know, the… this opens the possibility to many use cases, but also when we will see every time more sponsoring of gas in the future, and for sure, this will save a lot of

159
00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:25.139
German - EVVM.org: Costs for the ones that are sponsoring the token transfers.

160
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:40.630
German - EVVM.org: Because they will be able to pre-initialize the addresses of the users that they are going to sponsor the transactions when gas is low, so they will be saving a lot. And if you go to the Ethereum machines, if you let me show you something…

161
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:41.020
Zainan Victor Zhou: So.

162
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:49.780
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me run a quick, the reason I… so, as an editor, I'm usually not supposed to ask you,

163
00:26:49.930 --> 00:26:59.059
Zainan Victor Zhou: technical review questions. But here, I think the technical feedback and editorial feedback is slightly intertwined, because

164
00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:10.039
Zainan Victor Zhou: we want to prove… we want to work together to prove that this ERC is introducing, interfaces and definitions that can achieve

165
00:27:10.210 --> 00:27:15.589
Zainan Victor Zhou: the goal and rationale that this ERC want to achieve. For example, gas saving.

166
00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.440
Zainan Victor Zhou: So let me run a quick Thought experiment in this…

167
00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:27.429
Zainan Victor Zhou: reference implementation. Assuming, German, you started out, it pre-initialized your address.

168
00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:29.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: Which gives you a magic.

169
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:35.999
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right? Now, you also get, let's say, airdropped

170
00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.230
Zainan Victor Zhou: Token, let's say, happened to be two tokens, right?

171
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:47.579
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, let's say someone who already owned a token transferred to you,

172
00:27:49.060 --> 00:28:00.769
Zainan Victor Zhou: two tokens, what will happen? Then, this address 2 will be German's address, this number will be 2. The sender, who happened to have enough balance, would be able to give you 2.

173
00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.529
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes. Now… Yes.

174
00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:08.400
Zainan Victor Zhou: You are going to be swapping… The sender will be…

175
00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:16.790
Zainan Victor Zhou: updated to its balance, we don't care, but let's focus on the presumed German

176
00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:23.499
Zainan Victor Zhou: Address. Balanced by 32, German equals to… your current balance.

177
00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:26.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: Plus value, right?

178
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:27.620
German - EVVM.org: Yes.

179
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:35.869
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, and then this is a typical transfer. Now, your number becomes magic plus 2. This is the first step.

180
00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:42.639
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, the second step When you German want to transfer to me, Victor.

181
00:28:43.550 --> 00:28:51.020
Zainan Victor Zhou: You make a transfer. Now, I'm going to assume you are able to transfer me more than 2 tokens, maybe 3.

182
00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.780
German - EVVM.org: Okay. So, let's try to run this experiment, because I actually don't know how it will play out.

183
00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:03.070
Zainan Victor Zhou: So now the 2 is Victor's address, and the value is 3.

184
00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:12.209
Zainan Victor Zhou: The sender at this point would be… the balance would be… You will be… Having a magic…

185
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.680
German - EVVM.org: But this is… this is the point that is interesting.

186
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.170
Zainan Victor Zhou: for trademark.

187
00:29:16.170 --> 00:29:16.790
German - EVVM.org: Thank you.

188
00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.999
German - EVVM.org: Sorry? Yes, magic. Magic is treated as zero.

189
00:29:22.390 --> 00:29:23.569
German - EVVM.org: My chick is zero, so…

190
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:28.170
Zainan Victor Zhou: Magic is treated as 0, but currently the value is magic plus 2.

191
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.279
German - EVVM.org: But when you do the maths.

192
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:35.580
German - EVVM.org: Magic is zero, because it's a string.

193
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.770
German - EVVM.org: And then disappear.

194
00:29:37.770 --> 00:29:45.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, so here's the thing. If I… if I run this function, at this point, I'm going to read a number…

195
00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:48.830
Zainan Victor Zhou: of… Magic Plus 2.

196
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right?

197
00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:51.489
German - EVVM.org: No. Magic number.

198
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:51.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Excellent.

199
00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.070
German - EVVM.org: You just read two.

200
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.199
German - EVVM.org: Because my.

201
00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:55.670
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, Visa.

202
00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:56.170
German - EVVM.org: beer.

203
00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:02.709
Zainan Victor Zhou: where does it, like, if I run this function, read this function, does it read out 2?

204
00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.050
German - EVVM.org: Yes.

205
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:23.159
German - EVVM.org: Yes, balance is not… it's not… when you do the maths, the magic disappears, and this starts behaving as a unit. So the byte 32, when it's taken into maths.

206
00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:24.700
German - EVVM.org: disappears.

207
00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:31.659
Zainan Victor Zhou: I see where it disappeared. Can you… yeah, can you point me to the line of where that magic number get disappeared?

208
00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:42.870
German - EVVM.org: It could work in Solidity, there is already a test, this is deployed, and there is the testing transactions, and also the results, this same contract, and it's verified on.

209
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:43.940
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, okay.

210
00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.869
German - EVVM.org: Everything is already… Yes, it's… here you have the graphs on how you save.

211
00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.649
German - EVVM.org: And in, you know, in the, in the specification?

212
00:30:54.060 --> 00:31:01.460
German - EVVM.org: If you go there, reference implementation in the links, a little down, a little up, sorry.

213
00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:05.149
German - EVVM.org: In the, in the, in the Ethereum Machicians Forum.

214
00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:16.059
German - EVVM.org: Yes, you go a little up, this is how you say, but a little, a little more, there, there, there, the, down, a little down.

215
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:17.350
German - EVVM.org: Don't… where.

216
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Do you want to, yeah, do you want to present on your side?

217
00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:22.710
German - EVVM.org: Real testing results.

218
00:31:22.710 --> 00:31:23.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

219
00:31:23.370 --> 00:31:25.260
German - EVVM.org: We are testing receipts.

220
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:29.900
Zainan Victor Zhou: These are only testing the gas usage, right?

221
00:31:30.090 --> 00:31:31.450
Zainan Victor Zhou: What I want to…

222
00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:33.600
German - EVVM.org: He's a check. He's the codebroker.

223
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:37.040
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, well, let me, let me do this.

224
00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:37.820
German - EVVM.org: Good.

225
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:45.420
Zainan Victor Zhou: Assuming… Can you verify the… ERC20,

226
00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:53.230
Zainan Victor Zhou: Token will be able to execute the following transactions.

227
00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:58.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: One, mint, two, address… Alice?

228
00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let's say address.

229
00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:12.720
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alice, 20… token.

230
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:15.779
Zainan Victor Zhou: to pre-initialize.

231
00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.389
Zainan Victor Zhou: of Bob.

232
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alice… Transfer 20 to Bob.

233
00:32:27.910 --> 00:32:35.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, Bob transferred to… Let's, let's use just two, because that's making it hard, very hard.

234
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:38.809
Zainan Victor Zhou: Transfer to, 3 to…

235
00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:45.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Attempt to transfer 3 to, to Charlie.

236
00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.189
German - EVVM.org: Okay, this is already tested in the transactions.

237
00:32:56.050 --> 00:32:58.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: Exactly. And suppose the…

238
00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:04.529
Zainan Victor Zhou: So what will happen to… in your, implementation, what will happen to, step 4?

239
00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.499
German - EVVM.org: will… will… if… if Bob…

240
00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.710
German - EVVM.org: try… no, we'll fail, because Bob doesn't have 3.

241
00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:13.560
German - EVVM.org: Have two.

242
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:20.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, let's, supposed… yeah, that's what I think, too. Supposedly, Bob,

243
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:27.460
Zainan Victor Zhou: step 4 will fail. Can you run these four steps?

244
00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:34.609
Zainan Victor Zhou: In your transaction… in your… Reference, implementation, deployment.

245
00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: And show the failure.

246
00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.260
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

247
00:33:41.490 --> 00:33:42.060
German - EVVM.org: Okay.

248
00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:52.110
Zainan Victor Zhou: that's a… that's a technical question. If you already have a failure that you can, like, just show me on in transaction, I would be happy to take. Now.

249
00:33:52.110 --> 00:34:04.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: Usually, just to clarify, usually I'm not supposed to be giving technical reviews, because this is very specifically technical reviews. But we really want to test out that one of the implementations achieve your goal.

250
00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:11.090
Zainan Victor Zhou: So that's… this is, a valid, ERC definition.

251
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:23.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, can you… can you try to do that? Or do you think it would take you some more time? You can, like, we can… I can go review another… a few ERCs and come back, or do you already have a transaction that you can show?

252
00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:41.570
German - EVVM.org: I can do it, but, maybe you can go with another review, and don't lose minutes, and we come back in 10 minutes, or when you tell me at the call, and I will answer properly in the forum. Thank you.

253
00:34:41.570 --> 00:34:46.979
Zainan Victor Zhou: That's nice. Okay, cool. Let me just leave a message.

254
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:52.440
German - EVVM.org: I will do right now.

255
00:34:52.750 --> 00:35:08.010
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, this is… this… this one… over… Overall, look like… A really interesting proposal.

256
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:11.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: Just one thing I want.

257
00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:19.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: to check if the… Math still works in this new… approach.

258
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: Left a technical… Question. Common.

259
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: in East, Maggie.

260
00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:32.830
Zainan Victor Zhou: And… Yeah.

261
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:38.119
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me know when it's answered. Cool.

262
00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:46.860
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alright, thank you very much, German. We will make sure to prioritize once you, are done executing these transactions.

263
00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:49.100
German - EVVM.org: Thank you.

264
00:35:49.570 --> 00:36:01.259
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, okay. So, now let me come back to the second one. Pooja, I will let you lead and decide which EIP I should review next.

265
00:36:01.260 --> 00:36:08.110
Pooja Ranjan: So the next, we are joined by the author for PR number 1226, so if we can perhaps take a look at…

266
00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:10.269
Zainan Victor Zhou: 1, 2, 2, 6, okay.

267
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:19.129
Zainan Victor Zhou: And, is the author on the call today?

268
00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:22.510
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, it's John, and he's on the call, yeah.

269
00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:23.110
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hi, John.

270
00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.119
Jon - 8033: Alright, thank you for the review, appreciate it.

271
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:27.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

272
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:35.650
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, this was assigned 8033. Supposedly you already added that. I'm considering this as resolved.

273
00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:43.879
Zainan Victor Zhou: Positive… oh, yeah, I left a message, says we want to see if there's community interest.

274
00:36:45.700 --> 00:36:50.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: someone… AI console.

275
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:52.710
Zainan Victor Zhou: Or, of course.

276
00:36:53.780 --> 00:36:56.020
Zainan Victor Zhou: The important validation task.

277
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.060
Zainan Victor Zhou: Cool. Let me take a look.

278
00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:09.400
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay… Alrighty.

279
00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:15.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: I would… Check the ERC commit review and consider.

280
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:25.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: Actually, no, do not choose other ERCs due to increasing complexity, and then not to be constrained in meeting fee.

281
00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:26.780
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

282
00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:41.560
Zainan Victor Zhou: Take a look… with AI agents…

283
00:37:48.430 --> 00:37:49.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Foster City.

284
00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:51.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: What?

285
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:57.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, let me see the rationale… What?

286
00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:06.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: specific… what specific ERC you're not… you're saying, increasing the complexity?

287
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:17.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Complexity… would use… Does not provide a built-in review mechanism.

288
00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:25.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: Well, that's up for you to provide, that's intentionally left out, right? Like, it… input… adding that doesn't… dozen…

289
00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:30.469
Zainan Victor Zhou: Increase your complexity because you can choose them.

290
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:32.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right?

291
00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:41.479
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay… but that's your call.

292
00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:45.170
Zainan Victor Zhou: It would, it would reduce your…

293
00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:51.299
Zainan Victor Zhou: It would probably reduce, the, the adoptability.

294
00:38:52.100 --> 00:39:01.080
Zainan Victor Zhou: Amid review, that yes, it was also considered but not easily applicable to the text fields and resolution flow.

295
00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:08.819
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… Okay… I will consider that.

296
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:15.299
Zainan Victor Zhou: leave technical feedback, but this is answered and addressed. Thank you, John.

297
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:21.010
Zainan Victor Zhou: Console-based resolution flow.

298
00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.050
Zainan Victor Zhou: Must support core flow.

299
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: Recruit.

300
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.230
Zainan Victor Zhou: Request, create, agent, commit.

301
00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:30.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: review.

302
00:39:31.230 --> 00:39:37.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: judging, and aggregation and reward distribution. Okay.

303
00:39:42.110 --> 00:39:44.359
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can any one of them be optional?

304
00:40:11.830 --> 00:40:13.489
Jon - 8033: I don't think that any one of.

305
00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: And agents…

306
00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:15.790
Jon - 8033: the optional.

307
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, can… and implementation.

308
00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:24.650
Zainan Victor Zhou: Decide to allow free of reward distribution.

309
00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.030
Zainan Victor Zhou: I mean, that's for you to consider. You can say, no.

310
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:36.569
Zainan Victor Zhou: Definitely not. We will consider it incompliant with our ERC if you don't have it.

311
00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:54.149
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, that's, like, the mindset of ER as the definition. You want to allow people to adopt you as easy as possible, but also not too flexible that other people don't have the expectation. So, yeah, I'm just raising this question. It's for you to decide.

312
00:40:56.730 --> 00:40:58.869
Jon - 8033: Okay. Yeah, I, I think that…

313
00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:03.129
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, this is an optional comment, so you don't have to worry about this.

314
00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.150
Jon - 8033: Okay.

315
00:41:04.150 --> 00:41:09.810
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me not… let me not give it out as a… as a suggestion.

316
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.880
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me give out as a question, as a quote.

317
00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.579
Zainan Victor Zhou: Actually, probably this is the best format.

318
00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:18.550
Zainan Victor Zhou: -Oh.

319
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:28.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yes. Okay, now, the console consists of two agent roles, info agent, and Judge Agent.

320
00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:33.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: Two rows. We'll aggregate and resolve consoles.

321
00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: We make this distribution distinction to clarify.

322
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:52.989
Zainan Victor Zhou: Capability and domains… Are represented in strings.

323
00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:58.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: And, requests were represented in the struct of address.

324
00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: Reward.

325
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:01.880
Zainan Victor Zhou: token.

326
00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: Bald amount.

327
00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:14.620
Zainan Victor Zhou: Boned purr. Let me see if this is Clark that's decided… that is discussed.

328
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: And bond is a stake to defer.

329
00:42:20.330 --> 00:42:29.349
Zainan Victor Zhou: Spam, and actually… Actual enforcement or amount is implemented-specific.

330
00:42:34.370 --> 00:42:36.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm not sure if I read this…

331
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:47.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: sentence, this definition is important because it explains what bond is in this contest, but it's a little bit hard to understand. Can you…

332
00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:52.119
Zainan Victor Zhou: Kind of help me understand what is… what this sentence means.

333
00:42:53.110 --> 00:43:11.349
Jon - 8033: Yeah, so whenever the agents are committing their answer, there needs to be a bond. Otherwise, you know, if the answer is incorrect, you know, there's no negative consequence, so the bond acts as a negative consequence. If the.

334
00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:11.900
Zainan Victor Zhou: to answer the…

335
00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:16.809
Jon - 8033: They give us wrong, then the bond is, taken out.

336
00:43:16.810 --> 00:43:17.390
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's a.

337
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.979
Jon - 8033: It's given back. Yeah, yeah, it's, yeah, essentially it's a slashful stake, correct.

338
00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:29.360
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, I would advise… I would suggest that you rephrase this sentence, it's… because this sentence is a little bit hard to understand, like…

339
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:30.290
Jon - 8033: Okay.

340
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:37.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: or amount is implementation-specific. If you want to say bond is supposed to be a slashable stake.

341
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:50.209
Zainan Victor Zhou: so that that submission or malicious submission would be penalized, then I think it's okay. But if you say that it's also implementation-specific.

342
00:43:51.920 --> 00:44:03.780
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think that is no longer explaining bond, it's saying how bond can be implemented, right? So you basically…

343
00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.750
Jon - 8033: The intention was in the amount.

344
00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:06.640
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right.

345
00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.170
Jon - 8033: implementation specific.

346
00:44:08.610 --> 00:44:15.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right, so… If I were to make suggestions here, I would say.

347
00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:18.249
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, whoa, this is so long.

348
00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:37.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: Bond is a… slash… Bowl, stake, and agent put in… To… And, if this… if… And B…

349
00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.070
Zainan Victor Zhou: Panelize.

350
00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:47.150
Zainan Victor Zhou: If… I had to say that.

351
00:44:48.290 --> 00:44:57.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: If, the submission was turned out, Turns out to be wrong.

352
00:44:57.660 --> 00:44:59.330
Zainan Victor Zhou: Malicious.

353
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:09.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: As you see, yeah, and… And the amount… Of it is…

354
00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:18.719
Zainan Victor Zhou: Implementation-specific. Something like that. Just to kind of have a comma, have a period to separate the definition and the instruction.

355
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:20.070
Jon - 8033: Okay.

356
00:45:20.070 --> 00:45:37.580
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'll leave it to you. Basically… I'm suggesting… Except for… separating that… definition.

357
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:46.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Of a bond from its… From the instruction of how it should… can be.

358
00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:48.400
Zainan Victor Zhou: Demented. Okay.

359
00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:54.019
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… Okay, that's the… that's about the bond. Bond amount…

360
00:45:56.230 --> 00:46:06.110
Zainan Victor Zhou: per agent. And this means you are very specifically saying everyone is paying for the same amount, right? Because you only provide one information.

361
00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:07.690
Jon - 8033: Right.

362
00:46:09.150 --> 00:46:10.720
Zainan Victor Zhou: the Kumbai.

363
00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: And is that intentional?

364
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:17.230
Jon - 8033: Yes.

365
00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.600
Zainan Victor Zhou: And that is in the discussion of rationale, right?

366
00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:23.980
Jon - 8033: Yes.

367
00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:27.820
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay… Let me check the rationale.

368
00:46:29.330 --> 00:46:32.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: Bond amount is…

369
00:46:36.750 --> 00:46:40.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, because it's… everyone is an equal agent.

370
00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:41.420
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right?

371
00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:42.310
Jon - 8033: Yep.

372
00:46:42.610 --> 00:46:43.300
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

373
00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:44.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: Nice.

374
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:52.690
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is gonna take a little bit longer, because I think this is a long, longer ERC and have a lot of details.

375
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:57.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Deadline.

376
00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:01.569
Zainan Victor Zhou: Deadline, timestamp. Do you want to specify units?

377
00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:07.379
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is it Unix? Is it.

378
00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.699
Jon - 8033: I mean, I think we can leave it open up to…

379
00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.490
Zainan Victor Zhou: blocked.

380
00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:12.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, that…

381
00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.829
Jon - 8033: that's being specified.

382
00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:32.469
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, in that case, you have to declare that this is implementation-specific, and has to be consistent across different deadlines. Like, the request deadline should be consistent with the unit. Define the unit, or leave, declare

383
00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:38.600
Zainan Victor Zhou: that it's… Left for the… Implementation.

384
00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:47.499
Zainan Victor Zhou: And that, when you leave it to the implementation, it means two agent contracts that is con… and two agent…

385
00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:59.159
Zainan Victor Zhou: have to figure out… agent-client have to figure out what the deadline unit is in order to interact with this ER… in order to interact with one…

386
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.070
Zainan Victor Zhou: embodiment of your ERC.

387
00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:18.369
Zainan Victor Zhou: And therefore, you need to have a way to communicate with them. It is okay that you decide to say that, hey, everyone, communicate that outside of the ERC, maybe put your website, or you can also say, here is the thing, we… you can read it from

388
00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:25.240
Zainan Victor Zhou: From… from this ERC? Like, do you know what I'm… do you understand, did I make my point clear?

389
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.379
Jon - 8033: Yep, yep, no, I got it.

390
00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.410
Jon - 8033: We'll… we'll make a change to it.

391
00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:37.979
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, so that's the definition, like, in ERC20, the decimal was, like, clearly…

392
00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:47.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: Was decided to be, left for implementation, but then they provide an interface for everyone to say what their decimal is.

393
00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:52.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, so this is the query.

394
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.969
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is the specifications.

395
00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:04.150
Zainan Victor Zhou: You're going to send a lot of strings here, and then a huge… nasty struct.

396
00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.900
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's gonna be very fun to… to, parse.

397
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:15.400
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, a lot of events…

398
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:32.059
Zainan Victor Zhou: Agent… requested… Agent commit, agent reviewed, judge selected, How is Jack's Judge selected?

399
00:49:37.230 --> 00:49:45.279
Zainan Victor Zhou: Select… Randomly from a separate pool. Recommended. Distinct.

400
00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:52.479
Zainan Victor Zhou: Do you want to assume this is a security risk, and how advise the implementer

401
00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:59.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: how you would suggest them to select, because it's not there for you to do random.

402
00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:00.720
Jon - 8033: Right.

403
00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.240
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, we want to.

404
00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:06.809
Jon - 8033: We do the… the RANDOL, yeah, we, we actually, we go into this, into the EIP.

405
00:50:07.170 --> 00:50:10.819
Jon - 8033: There is definitely discussion on how to select the judges.

406
00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:14.869
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, a random judge. Our role-based approach.

407
00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:21.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: Our role-based approach. Is that an… is that a…

408
00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:25.139
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is this approach an ERC-level concept?

409
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:29.090
Zainan Victor Zhou: Or an, or an implementation level concept.

410
00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:31.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: When you say our approach.

411
00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.700
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see…

412
00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:37.520
Jon - 8033: So, it's two different agents.

413
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:40.950
Jon - 8033: Still able to see it.

414
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:44.520
Jon - 8033: the roles of the agents, not the ERC.

415
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:46.019
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, the ro- okay, so.

416
00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:47.640
Jon - 8033: Separate pools.

417
00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:52.179
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's separate. The ERCs specifically define different…

418
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:56.050
Zainan Victor Zhou: role. Therefore, this approach is ERC level.

419
00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.490
Zainan Victor Zhou: Optional reputation thresholds.

420
00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

421
00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.439
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see… Okay, judge?

422
00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.619
Zainan Victor Zhou: Judge selection is an important thing.

423
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:20.829
Zainan Victor Zhou: resolution… has a… has a… has a different stage. It has finalized stage.

424
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:32.019
Zainan Victor Zhou: It has failure stage. I would suggest you swap the… Swap to… These order, if you want.

425
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:37.279
Zainan Victor Zhou: Supposedly, resolution finalized, then failure can be closer.

426
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:43.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, this is… a reason.

427
00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:51.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: Dispute initiated. Dispute window opened. Dispute resolved.

428
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.760
Zainan Victor Zhou: So you're giving it a dispute.

429
00:51:55.050 --> 00:51:56.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: approach.

430
00:51:57.440 --> 00:52:00.990
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, core method, you need to implement core method.

431
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:05.140
Zainan Victor Zhou: A lot of times, these different parts

432
00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:11.210
Zainan Victor Zhou: can be written in the format of different interfaces, you know? Have you considered that?

433
00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:20.039
Zainan Victor Zhou: And then you can say, our interface is a union of these three interfaces, and the court, like, when you declare the…

434
00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:27.250
Zainan Victor Zhou: The request creation, agent commit review, judging aggregation, and reward distribution.

435
00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.089
Zainan Victor Zhou: By the way, I think you would also…

436
00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:37.789
Zainan Victor Zhou: Need to mention the dispute in this… here, right?

437
00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:46.730
Zainan Victor Zhou: You have defined dispute interfaces, it's probably better to include that in these part.

438
00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:47.950
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right.

439
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:53.450
Zainan Victor Zhou: In the, in the overview.

440
00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:57.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: I'm assuming this part is the overview and the specification.

441
00:52:57.950 --> 00:53:02.959
Jon - 8033: Yeah, we do go into the dispute part, but sure, we can put it in the overview.

442
00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:11.630
Zainan Victor Zhou: I mean, yeah, it seems like dispute is quite important in your interface definition.

443
00:53:12.180 --> 00:53:17.669
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… I would, I would, I would leave it, I would also include that.

444
00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:24.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… And then you have to decide whether that's masked or not.

445
00:53:24.980 --> 00:53:27.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: And since you put it in.

446
00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:37.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: Workflow.

447
00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:41.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is it?

448
00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.679
Zainan Victor Zhou: How should I put in the dispute? And,

449
00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:55.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: And dispute. Rez.

450
00:53:55.860 --> 00:53:57.450
Zainan Victor Zhou: Resolution.

451
00:53:57.690 --> 00:53:58.930
Zainan Victor Zhou: process.

452
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:04.460
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

453
00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, here's distribute…

454
00:54:24.190 --> 00:54:34.429
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, reveal, commit… Commit ID, review… Request ID.

455
00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.220
Zainan Victor Zhou: Nonsense.

456
00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:55.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: So… Is your bond…

457
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:06.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is your bonds paid in reward token, or is your bond paid in native, like Ethers?

458
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.459
Jon - 8033: It would be up to the implementation.

459
00:55:11.410 --> 00:55:13.950
Zainan Victor Zhou: And if it… if you want to allow…

460
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:19.090
Zainan Victor Zhou: If you want to allow bond amount to be paid in reward token.

461
00:55:19.770 --> 00:55:22.920
Zainan Victor Zhou: Then, either you have to define

462
00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:30.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, here's the thing, you have to make that decision as a… ERC author.

463
00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:38.320
Zainan Victor Zhou: If you want to leave it to the implementation implementer, you have to call it out and provide a way for them to tell.

464
00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:44.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: For example, if you say, I want to let everyone use their own token for bond.

465
00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:49.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: Then, do they have to be the reward token, or not?

466
00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:51.729
Zainan Victor Zhou: What do you… is… what's your call?

467
00:55:54.760 --> 00:56:07.099
Jon - 8033: We would like to make it open enough that if they want to make all of the reward, the bond, the same token, or if they want the reward to be in Ether, and the bond to be in another token, that they have the ability to do that.

468
00:56:07.450 --> 00:56:13.679
Zainan Victor Zhou: That's… that's nice, that's very nice. That means that information had to be included in the request.

469
00:56:17.170 --> 00:56:22.019
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right? Then you'll have to have an address of bond token.

470
00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:26.470
Zainan Victor Zhou: If you want to make that… if you want to allow the implementer to decide that.

471
00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:33.179
Zainan Victor Zhou: You can also say… yeah, alternatively, you can also say, yeah, we allow you to use any token, but it must

472
00:56:33.330 --> 00:56:35.800
Zainan Victor Zhou: Be the same one with reward token.

473
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:45.830
Zainan Victor Zhou: that's also an option, right? But now, when I see…

474
00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:54.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: the reason why I'm raising that question is because I see the commit function Has a payable mark.

475
00:56:54.450 --> 00:56:56.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right? Which means…

476
00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:05.940
Zainan Victor Zhou: And then it… the comment says, with bond. When everyone… when most of the contract implementer read this part.

477
00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:09.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think we will think that bond is paid

478
00:57:09.260 --> 00:57:15.389
Zainan Victor Zhou: with the native token, Ethers, in Maint, because you want to use the payable.

479
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:22.749
Zainan Victor Zhou: So that's, like, the… that's the kind of,

480
00:57:24.290 --> 00:57:28.270
Zainan Victor Zhou: clarity we need, as a reader of your ERC.

481
00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:38.170
Zainan Victor Zhou: So I will leave a message of, can we clarify what token does.

482
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: the bond. Accept.

483
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:54.460
Zainan Victor Zhou: Does it make sense? I think I am giving a verbal comment. I'm a little bit lazy to type them out.

484
00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:56.830
Jon - 8033: Yeah.

485
00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.849
Jon - 8033: Yeah, we can make the change. Thank you.

486
00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:00.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah.

487
00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:06.760
Zainan Victor Zhou: And… Reveal… and… okay, let me see…

488
00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:18.450
Zainan Victor Zhou: Because you're distributing rewards, I'm assuming those bonds should also be distributed back in the life cycle of this arrangement, right?

489
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:21.179
Jon - 8033: Yeah, that's part of the resolution.

490
00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:28.209
Zainan Victor Zhou: In the resolution, bond will be distributed back. Let me make sure that it's discussed.

491
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:40.259
Zainan Victor Zhou: Reward distribution. Refund the bond.

492
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:44.550
Zainan Victor Zhou: forfeed others.

493
00:58:55.570 --> 00:59:01.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: By the way, do you assume Judge Agent to be one single agent, or multiple agent?

494
00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:03.530
Jon - 8033: One single agent.

495
00:59:03.530 --> 00:59:08.969
Zainan Victor Zhou: One single agent, and… The implementation may forfeit

496
00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:13.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: The judge agent. In what way?

497
00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:18.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, if it fails to resolve in the allotted window. So the judge agents are…

498
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:24.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Believe to be truthful and honest.

499
00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: No matter what.

500
00:59:27.460 --> 00:59:32.160
Jon - 8033: Not necessarily, I mean, that's why we do have the dispute mechanism, but yeah.

501
00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, right.

502
00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.010
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

503
00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:43.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: disputes, okay. Optional dis… extensions.

504
00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:46.950
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, right. And…

505
01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.490
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, I think that would be a better…

506
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.590
Zainan Victor Zhou: Summary.

507
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:20.409
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh… Okay, I will delete this too.

508
01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:22.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: Excellent.

509
01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:30.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: Security, selection, collusion of… Bonds.

510
01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:37.569
Zainan Victor Zhou: They're… Here in this… of random selection.

511
01:00:39.740 --> 01:00:46.650
Zainan Victor Zhou: of judge, so rely… on the… Talk.

512
01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.420
Zainan Victor Zhou: crypto strengths.

513
01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.850
Zainan Victor Zhou: of… Randomness.

514
01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:59.099
Zainan Victor Zhou: Indus… In a security consideration.

515
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:08.770
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

516
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:12.020
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, this is the…

517
01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:18.910
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is an aggregate.

518
01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:25.719
Zainan Victor Zhou: There's one request. The aggregate is to aggregate answers.

519
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.260
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, final answer.

520
01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.220
Zainan Victor Zhou: How does Aggregate work?

521
01:01:40.170 --> 01:01:43.909
Jon - 8033: The judge agent will look at the… sorry, go ahead.

522
01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:51.029
Zainan Victor Zhou: The judge will call the aid aggregate to submit the final answer and classify winners.

523
01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:01.289
Zainan Victor Zhou: Implementation must auto-count.

524
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:05.189
Zainan Victor Zhou: Reviewed votes and picked majority.

525
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:10.879
Zainan Victor Zhou: In that case, does it still need a judge?

526
01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:14.890
Jon - 8033: Yeah.

527
01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:19.359
Jon - 8033: You know, the agents could put incorrect information.

528
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:32.380
Zainan Victor Zhou: But you also say it must alto count. So, let's say Judd, based on the… Submitted revealed votes.

529
01:02:33.050 --> 01:02:35.270
Zainan Victor Zhou: This… there is one answer.

530
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:41.100
Zainan Victor Zhou: And the judge… Counted it, but decided to override that answer.

531
01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:45.430
Zainan Victor Zhou: Is that a possible implementation?

532
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:49.990
Zainan Victor Zhou: in this proposal? Like, is that still considered compliant?

533
01:02:51.780 --> 01:03:01.669
Jon - 8033: Yeah, I mean, we'd want to be able to make it possible that if all of the agents were saying something incorrectly, the judge would have the option to

534
01:03:02.090 --> 01:03:04.470
Jon - 8033: override it and say no. So, yeah.

535
01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.550
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I think I would need… I would suggest clarifying…

536
01:03:10.850 --> 01:03:14.730
Zainan Victor Zhou: What it means to be… must auto-count.

537
01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:17.110
Zainan Victor Zhou: and also…

538
01:03:20.980 --> 01:03:23.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you clarify?

539
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:27.610
Zainan Victor Zhou: What it means by… Must.

540
01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:29.779
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alto count.

541
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:36.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: Using… maybe… Solidity.

542
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:40.520
Zainan Victor Zhou: Code to sh… Dead.

543
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:42.069
Zainan Victor Zhou: Code demo.

544
01:03:43.890 --> 01:03:45.040
Zainan Victor Zhou: to show.

545
01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:53.040
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, because I… when I read that, I'm a little bit puzzled, right? Like, if it's already counted, then…

546
01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:02.960
Zainan Victor Zhou: Then you don't need to pass in the answer.

547
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:09.160
Zainan Victor Zhou: Or… And,

548
01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:26.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: clarify how… to handle the case when Judge Agent… Believe the… Info agents.

549
01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:34.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: Boats… Need to be… be overwritten.

550
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.190
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right. Ugh.

551
01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

552
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:51.899
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now we're at what step we are now. We're in aggregates. Let's see what else does Aggregates will do.

553
01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:54.440
Zainan Victor Zhou: It will show the winners.

554
01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:58.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: And the winner must be the info agent.

555
01:04:59.740 --> 01:05:03.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: Winner for reward. Classification.

556
01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:07.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, so, winner, winner…

557
01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:14.660
Zainan Victor Zhou: Call distribute this rewards to pay out correct.

558
01:05:15.370 --> 01:05:27.819
Zainan Victor Zhou: In agent, which means such rewards must be… stored somewhere, like this… This, we'll store the wiener, okay?

559
01:05:30.570 --> 01:05:32.119
Zainan Victor Zhou: Based on config.

560
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:40.309
Zainan Victor Zhou: Professional splits, implement a specific ratio, like judge fees, Refund bonds to correct.

561
01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:47.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: Info agents… Forfeit others, emit Distributed.

562
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:58.640
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, it must pick, it must vote, it must… Count and pick majority.

563
01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:05.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: Which means… The judge will have to pick the majority.

564
01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:13.370
Zainan Victor Zhou: So the judge cannot overwrite the answer, I think.

565
01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:19.920
Zainan Victor Zhou: If you, if, if you, say, have to… must… auto count, I'm assuming, must…

566
01:06:20.430 --> 01:06:22.810
Zainan Victor Zhou: The word must also apply to pig.

567
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:24.750
Zainan Victor Zhou: Right?

568
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:28.469
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I guess the question is, can judge override

569
01:06:31.690 --> 01:06:34.219
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can judge override the votes?

570
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:35.480
Zainan Victor Zhou: Question.

571
01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:46.290
Zainan Victor Zhou: Hand judge over… Judge agent overwrite the… Majority of votes.

572
01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:08.180
Zainan Victor Zhou: If yes… Then, why is… must also applying to IC.

573
01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:12.780
Zainan Victor Zhou: maybe decide… Must.

574
01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.660
Zainan Victor Zhou: decide if… to pick.

575
01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.640
Zainan Victor Zhou: If no, then… Judge.

576
01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.060
Zainan Victor Zhou: Agent.

577
01:07:27.270 --> 01:07:28.980
Zainan Victor Zhou: Cannot override.

578
01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:37.580
Zainan Victor Zhou: the majority of votes. And why does it need to Submit.

579
01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:40.280
Zainan Victor Zhou: Final.

580
01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:42.109
Zainan Victor Zhou: Final answer.

581
01:07:44.150 --> 01:07:50.219
Zainan Victor Zhou: When such answer Can and must be decided.

582
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:54.310
Zainan Victor Zhou: Base.

583
01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:57.319
Zainan Victor Zhou: Already submitted.

584
01:07:58.860 --> 01:07:59.710
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oats.

585
01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.810
Zainan Victor Zhou: So that's my question. Do you have an answer to this?

586
01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:10.130
Zainan Victor Zhou: This is pure editorial. This is unclarity that can lead to too understanding.

587
01:08:12.550 --> 01:08:14.219
Jon - 8033: Sorry, give me one second.

588
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, in this particular… This is an important part of your proposal.

589
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.050
Jon - 8033: That's.

590
01:08:22.050 --> 01:08:28.249
Zainan Victor Zhou: judge process, judge must auto-count, review votes, and pick majority.

591
01:08:28.600 --> 01:08:33.530
Zainan Victor Zhou: Now, the question is, can Judge Agent override the majority of votes?

592
01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:40.470
Zainan Victor Zhou: If yes, then must does not apply to pick. Judge must decide if to pick.

593
01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:48.790
Zainan Victor Zhou: If not, if judge cannot override the majority of votes, then the final answer should not be submitted by judge.

594
01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:55.930
Zainan Victor Zhou: The judge… the final answer should be, like, derived from the state of the contract.

595
01:08:56.290 --> 01:09:01.359
Zainan Victor Zhou: And there's no point having a parameter of final answer.

596
01:09:01.609 --> 01:09:03.720
Zainan Victor Zhou: In, in this aggregate.

597
01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:08.289
Jon - 8033: Yeah, so it also depends, too, if it's a discrete answer or an open-ended answer as well.

598
01:09:08.839 --> 01:09:11.309
Jon - 8033: So we can specify that.

599
01:09:13.029 --> 01:09:20.169
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, I'll leave it to you to just… this is a question I think would benefit your implementer.

600
01:09:21.259 --> 01:09:22.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: To clarify.

601
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:32.049
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, I will move on to… I guess we're very close to time, probably have to come back again. I think I'm…

602
01:09:32.199 --> 01:09:35.959
Zainan Victor Zhou: like… One-third way,

603
01:09:36.149 --> 01:09:48.849
Zainan Victor Zhou: I think, from the logic side, I'm halfway or two-thirds way on, but for the rationale, it probably wouldn't take that long, but probably it would take another time.

604
01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:56.089
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I wonder, Poja, how should we proceed? Should we…

605
01:09:56.229 --> 01:10:01.409
Zainan Victor Zhou: I want to kind of give German some time if he… if he's still here.

606
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:03.139
Zainan Victor Zhou: If that's okay.

607
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:08.649
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, that's perfectly alright. We have a couple of minutes left. German, if you have any updates

608
01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.839
Pooja Ranjan: To be shared with… Yes, smart.

609
01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:26.429
German - EVVM.org: Hello? Yes, I just posted all the tests, and it was successful, so I think someone has to approve my reply, or my reply is…

610
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.540
German - EVVM.org: It's on the forum already.

611
01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:33.079
Zainan Victor Zhou: Let me see, where is the link?

612
01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:38.259
Zainan Victor Zhou: And John, sorry to not being able to finish this review in one pass.

613
01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.289
Jon - 8033: It's okay, thank you.

614
01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:47.839
Zainan Victor Zhou: But yeah, you have a very, large and comprehensive and important ERC, so we want to, like.

615
01:10:47.970 --> 01:10:50.559
Zainan Victor Zhou: Give it enough attention it deserves.

616
01:10:53.550 --> 01:11:03.969
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, let me go back to the link that, Pooja pulls up, let me see…

617
01:11:09.270 --> 01:11:12.260
Pooja Ranjan: So we're looking for magician link for that proposal, or…

618
01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:16.889
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yeah, I'm trying to look at that magician link, it's, I've been…

619
01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:22.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: too deep into the… the Asian Council Oracle review.

620
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.169
Pooja Ranjan: I just shared in the chat for your reference.

621
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:26.230
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay.

622
01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:33.840
Zainan Victor Zhou: brain overload. You have too much information in one ERC.

623
01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:38.890
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, so this is my, question… let me post.

624
01:11:49.530 --> 01:11:57.200
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, I'm now back to the ERC3003… 8003 on my question comment.

625
01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.929
Zainan Victor Zhou: German, have you posted your answer here?

626
01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:10.830
German - EVVM.org: Yes, I did, but I can't see it. It was very, very extensive, and with all the tests,

627
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:12.349
Zainan Victor Zhou: I refreshed, I didn't see it.

628
01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:15.690
German - EVVM.org: I didn't close your test?

629
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:20.510
Zainan Victor Zhou: Can you post your, your, your, your… can you post your link?

630
01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.499
German - EVVM.org: I can't see it, and maybe it went to drafts?

631
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.000
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, yeah, maybe you went to draft. Can you share your, your, your, your, your…

632
01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:39.479
German - EVVM.org: No, I mean, it was for approval from someone, maybe?

633
01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.159
Zainan Victor Zhou: Mmm, I'm not seeing more…

634
01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:42.670
German - EVVM.org: Right.

635
01:12:42.670 --> 01:12:44.170
Zainan Victor Zhou: The hosting, and then…

636
01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:46.240
German - EVVM.org: It's on pending.

637
01:12:47.370 --> 01:12:50.730
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, you couldn't… you couldn't submit the reply?

638
01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.750
German - EVVM.org: Yes, it's on pending.

639
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:56.130
Pooja Ranjan: Give me a second, I will try to approve that.

640
01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:02.599
Zainan Victor Zhou: Do we now need, approval for, Yves Magician's reply?

641
01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:11.229
Pooja Ranjan: Not really, but I think in this case, because they are using some address, and it could be flagged by the bot that these.

642
01:13:11.230 --> 01:13:12.360
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh…

643
01:13:12.850 --> 01:13:15.889
Pooja Ranjan: So now you should be in Get a response.

644
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.620
German - EVVM.org: How you going?

645
01:13:16.620 --> 01:13:17.270
Zainan Victor Zhou: It's weird.

646
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:23.679
Zainan Victor Zhou: That's weird, that's the author. It should not be flagged if the post is flagged.

647
01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:27.680
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh, because you're adding… you're adding a lot of links, that's possible.

648
01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:29.390
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, yeah, so the bot is designed.

649
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:30.690
Zainan Victor Zhou: I didn't know if you had anything fishy.

650
01:13:30.690 --> 01:13:33.650
Pooja Ranjan: She should be planned here, yeah, so that's why it was blocked.

651
01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:38.109
Zainan Victor Zhou: Bob to Charlie transfer will fail.

652
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:49.640
German - EVVM.org: I made all the steps with the 3 new accounts, and I added an extra step to send 2 tokens.

653
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.560
German - EVVM.org: After this failure.

654
01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.970
Zainan Victor Zhou: Insufficient? Okay.

655
01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.790
Zainan Victor Zhou: That's Sepolia…

656
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:21.219
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, that's, that's a very interesting approach. I will probably have to study more, but that at least, is a valid… is a test that I'm happy to see, and let me merge it as a draft, for… for… now that you have, show.

657
01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:23.589
Zainan Victor Zhou: That it, it would fail.

658
01:14:24.590 --> 01:14:36.410
Zainan Victor Zhou: So, there is a way to make sure that the math works. I think you do need to clear up the… some of the bot's failure, but I'm going to give it a thumbs up.

659
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:42.940
German - EVVM.org: Yes, yes, the bot… that bot is going every day to.

660
01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:43.500
Zainan Victor Zhou: Awesome.

661
01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.789
German - EVVM.org: Because I don't see it.

662
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.830
Zainan Victor Zhou: Oh.

663
01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:50.000
Zainan Victor Zhou: Okay, cool.

664
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:56.579
Zainan Victor Zhou: Alright, thank you very much, and for whoever else is waiting, I'm sorry that we didn't get a chance to get to you.

665
01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.820
German - EVVM.org: Thank you so much for your time.

666
01:15:00.820 --> 01:15:11.890
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, Victor. Thank you, everyone, for joining, and people, if you could not get your PR reviewed this week, we would be having another meeting on November 4th, so try to leave a comment.

667
01:15:11.890 --> 01:15:21.809
Pooja Ranjan: And we'll try to include it in the agenda. But in the meantime, also, editors are taking a look at your PRs. It's not only editing office hours only, so please…

668
01:15:21.870 --> 01:15:27.739
Pooja Ranjan: Feel free to drop in the Discord channel, editor's channel, as well as drop your link here in the agenda.

669
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:38.539
Pooja Ranjan: And we are also organizing EIP Summit at DevConnect, so if you are around, please stop by. It would be a good opportunity to meet editors, authors, developers, and exchange our thoughts.

670
01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:41.520
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, everyone, once again for joining.

671
01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.340
Zainan Victor Zhou: Yep. Bye.

672
01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:44.910
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, Pooja.

673
01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:48.720
German - EVVM.org: your picture.
