00:22:22	Łukasz Rozmej:	Should we wait with BPO3 until the demand increases?
00:22:33	Matthew Keil:	Yes, I think its prudent
00:22:33	Justin Florentine (Besu):	what do we do if it starts hitting target but its all spam?
00:23:12	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

Is it our role to judge what is spam or not?
00:23:23	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

i'm honestly not sure
00:23:53	Justin Traglia:	What target/max numbers are we going to push for? 24/32?
00:24:02	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

so I think the answer is generally no, but yes on the edges - so I think it depends how the fees look
00:24:11	Barnabas:	Replying to "What target/max numb..."

TBD
00:24:14	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

but i think we're getting to the point that agreeing to increase it might be that judgement
00:24:35	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "What target/max numb..."

Yeah I was just curious. Makes sense.
00:25:18	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

i think fees is a good enough answer for me

It’ s a tricky situation. To be the Devil’s advocate why should main net validators be stressed by lowering the blob gas price just to get spam. This is something that should be really dealt with at the L2 level, if L2s start pumping the gas limit to the point that only one operator in the world can run their nodes, they could easily take all of L1’s blob space. 

I don’t advocate for us making a decision on what’s spam and what’ s not, but there should be a push back against L2s needlessly becoming BSC.
00:28:47	Potuz:	Replying to "what do we do if it ..."

On the back of L1 validators.

00:31:02	Barnabas:	We should aim for alpha 1 release for the devnet, otherwise everyone will have to implement a broken phase 0 changes.

00:38:27	Potuz:	Yeah if we go that route we need to specify that
00:38:30	Potuz:	Cause that affects scores

00:45:13	NC:	This doesn’t need to be included for devnet 0 does it?
00:45:37	Barnabas:	Replying to "This doesn’t need to..."

no
00:45:53	Barnabas:	Replying to "This doesn’t need to..."

alpha 1 is the new target for devnet 0
00:46:25	Barnabas:	Replying to "This doesn’t need to..."

if we agree to include this down the road it can become the scope of a future devnet
00:47:26	Potuz:	I think we’ll end up having to have a breakout anyway this call is probably not good enough to discuss technical details like these
00:47:33	Mario Vega:	Reacted to "I think we’ll end up..." with 👍🏼
00:47:59	Justin Traglia:	For the next one, we should discuss it on discord.
00:48:10	Potuz:	We did for most of them
00:52:38	Marius van der Wijden:	But isn't that just a ci problem?
00:54:29	Marius van der Wijden:	So you want to merge the epbs stuff directly into master?
00:54:59	Barnabas:	prysm already does
00:55:19	Potuz:	Replying to "So you want to merge..."

Yes, we want to be merging into our develop branch
00:55:32	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "So you want to merge..." 

 This is not a very pipeline-able approach
00:55:50	Mario Vega:	https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20milestone%3Aamsterdam
00:56:06	Potuz:	Replying to "So you want to merge..."

We already have prototyped this before and it’s really the only way of getting production code out there. Teku and Nimbus are doing the same
00:56:08	Potuz:	Replying to "So you want to merge..."

Not sure about LH
00:57:00	Mario Vega:	7778, 7708, 7843, 8024
00:57:16	Barnabas:	Are these EL only changes?
00:57:43	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "So you want to merge..." 

 What we usually do is build it on a separate branch and then upstream it in chunks to the mainline. Thus we can enable the new tests on the branch and the old tests on master and we switch over once everything is in master
00:58:00	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "So you want to merge..." 

 And we continuously rebase the fork
00:58:31	Łukasz Rozmej:	we have SLOTNUM: https://github.com/NethermindEth/nethermind/pull/7981

01:03:50	Marius van der Wijden:	I don't think going to 75m or any gas increase right now is important
01:04:06	Marius van der Wijden:	We should focus on repricings imho
01:04:12	Marius van der Wijden:	And eth70
01:06:06	Potuz:	@Kamil Chodoła what’s the difference in execution+broadcast time from 60 to 75 on the same node you’re measuring?

01:07:20	Kamil Chodoła:	Replying to "@Kamil Chodoła wh..."

Benchmarks for now are only execution focused and we test on 100 Mgas blocks.

We convert the data captured into MGas/s and make assumptions based on that
