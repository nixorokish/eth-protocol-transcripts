00:28:41	draganrakita:	We are planing Reth release for Wednesday.
00:28:50	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Teku release in progress. Should be out n a few hours
00:28:54	Marius van der Wijden:	Geth is working on a release, either today or tomorrow
00:29:12	Kamil Chodoła:	Nethermind Yes
00:29:31	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	60M default for teku already in past release too
00:29:52	Phil Ngo:	Lodestar is working on a release pending this fix with the zero proofs. We could release but it would be incomplete. We’ll take a look to see if we can get it fixed by today
00:30:06	Fredrik:	Can we discuss the mainnet plan for 2 min after the release topic?
00:30:12	Kamil Chodoła:	Is there any deadline for releases to have input for blogpost etc? As worst-case may be we will release tomorrow.
00:30:28	Fredrik:	(Upgrade & incident response plan)
00:30:48	Kamil Chodoła:	So deadline 5th
00:31:20	Kamil Chodoła:	OK for Neth - gives us a bit more time to make better version
00:32:51	James:	I don’t think we would make Wednesday. We wouldn’t have any time to soak the release
00:32:53	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Is it reasonable 5th for prysm?
00:33:38	Kamil Chodoła:	Release candidate can be 5th for Prysm maybe?
00:33:40	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	What about LH?
00:34:17	James:	Replying to "Is it reasonable 5th…"
I mean under best case maybe but it’s going to be really hard I don’t think it’s reasonable based on our release process
00:34:43	Manu:	Replying to "Is it reasonable 5th..."

5th release candidate, not release for sure
00:36:51	Marius van der Wijden:	Anything we can help clients with wrt. releasing?
00:37:18	Barnabas:	Replying to "Anything we can help..."

pushing buttons 😄
00:37:21	Mario Vega:	https://github.com/ethsteel/pm/issues/7
00:38:02	Raúl Kripalani:	Same, pls ping me on TG if the networking team can help in any way (reviews, testing, impl, etc.)
00:38:45	Ansgar Dietrichs:	is the idea to go though all of them? or identify the highest impact ones and only assess those?
00:39:02	spencer-tb:	Replying to "is the idea to go th..."

All of them I believe!
00:39:37	Barnabas:	Even EIPs besu/erigon/reth
Odd EIPs geth/nethermind/nimbusel
00:39:43	Ansgar Dietrichs:	we might have a first batch of decisions this week on acde as well, with some first DFIs
00:39:47	wolovim:	Forkcast rank page is back up, in case helpful for client team scoping preferences: https://forkcast.org/rank

00:40:51	Barnabas:	@lightclient sounds like a skill issue 😂
00:41:53	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	+1 to @lightclient, we are overwhelmed from OCL side on what to prioritize for review
00:42:14	Marius van der Wijden:	I think its easiest to talk about what to kick/deprioritize quickly

00:43:16	Mario Vega:	Replying to "I think its easiest ..."

There’s some that are really undespec’d, we should start with kicking those out
00:44:38	Ansgar Dietrichs:	within repricings, Maria also posted a document on bundling options for repricings

so the core EIPs within that document would be the highest priority from the repricings
