00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.090
Barnabas: Hello, everyone.

2
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.239
Barnabas: Let's give it a few more minutes, and then we can get started.

3
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:31.400
Barnabas: I think we can get started. Akash, can you start the stream?

4
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.500
Akash | ECH: We are liar.

5
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:46.529
Barnabas: Thank you. Welcome, everybody, to ACDT number 60. We seem to have a very light schedule for today, but let's jump straight into it.

6
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:58.090
Barnabas: So, physical-related topics, last week we had, supporting BPO2, and, Hodi, Physical activation, fork activation.

7
00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:09.309
Barnabas: Most things went smoothly, except, Prism, found a bulb. I will get, Manu to talk about that in a little bit.

8
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:20.010
Barnabas: And, for the rest of this week, we are expecting BP01 to go live on Hudi, and hopefully that will be a smooth transition as well.

9
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.880
Barnabas: Madok, would you like to take the floor?

10
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:38.839
Manu: So let me pass the… So, HackMD. So, yeah, briefly, I just read the TRDR.

11
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:44.630
Manu: So, we notized two things, with Prism.

12
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:49.889
Manu: The first one is starting at Houdi, Fusaka and Houdi.

13
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:59.210
Manu: We noticed a few attester nodes on the network, which are struggling. By struggling, I'm… Talking about…

14
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:06.960
Manu: Producing attestation where target.epoch minus source.epoch is higher strictly than 2.

15
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:13.280
Manu: There's not maybe Prism, or maybe not, I don't know yet.

16
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:21.440
Manu: And, yes, and so when, this is, this is the first issue, and when, we have some node storing like that.

17
00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:34.579
Manu: in some cases, PRISM, when receiving attestation from those notes, may, in some cases, reject attestation, and then don't score to the peer…

18
00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:40.859
Manu: who broadcast it, who, yeah, who gossiped the attestation and eventually disconnects the PR.

19
00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:50.529
Manu: And at the end, yes, we see that we mainly lose a lot of lighter spills, and…

20
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:53.729
Manu: We gain a lot of, present peers.

21
00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:02.439
Manu: Yeah, so this is the TLDR, if you want to read in more details, there is a HackMD which is linked in the chat.

22
00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.870
Manu: And we are working on a fix.

23
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:09.189
Manu: Hopefully today, or… Early this week.

24
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:17.010
Barnabas: Okay, great. So we were hoping to get all the claims released out by end of today.

25
00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:19.939
Manu: So, I assume that might not be possible.

26
00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.110
Barnabas: represent anymore?

27
00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.979
Manu: No, no, no, no. Not for today, for sure. For sure, even if we, if we fix the…

28
00:09:26.250 --> 00:09:31.529
Manu: click the bug today, I mean, we will need some days, a few days for soaking before releasing.

29
00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:34.490
Manu: So, definitely not today.

30
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:38.939
Barnabas: Right, okay.

31
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:48.180
Barnabas: What about any other client teams? Anyone found any Fusaka-related books, in the recent days, or during Hudi?

32
00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.970
Barnabas: Okay, and regarding, any other… yep.

33
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.190
Barnabas: Enrico?

34
00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.140
Barnabas: Enrico, you raise your hand.

35
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:27.099
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Sorry, I was in mute.

36
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:37.000
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I joined late, so I don't know if it's been mentioned already, but by the end of last week, we discovered some…

37
00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.210
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Bad blob sidecars.

38
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:50.160
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): KCG proofs flow… with the wrong KCG proofs floating around in the network, and we did an analysis that has been…

39
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:59.300
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Like that in many… many, destinants before.

40
00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:19.320
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, we noticed that, because we had a bug log that was printing, that some of the website card we received would have been rejected, and then we did… we dig into that, and we found out that the proofs were wrong. So, according to my

41
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:31.440
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, according to my, to my latest update, it was a load star primarily sending this over the network, and apparently they're working on a fix.

42
00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:42.269
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And, we started the minute release, and we should do… we should go out with it in the upcoming hours.

43
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:48.349
Barnabas: So was it just a partial number of blobs?

44
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.360
Barnabas: Or all blood… Transactions?

45
00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:53.050
Barnabas: We're incorrect.

46
00:11:53.510 --> 00:12:00.089
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The blob sidecars were wrong, so it was… they were including

47
00:12:00.330 --> 00:12:08.129
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): wrong KCG proofs, essentially. Not passing KCG validation over the gossip rule validation.

48
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.269
Barnabas: Did we not catch this earlier?

49
00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.409
Barnabas: When the block became invalid.

50
00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.169
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): That's a good question.

51
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:26.579
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We've probably changed something on the logging side that become… make this more, evident.

52
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.519
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the frequency of on Houdi happening was…

53
00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:41.739
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): probably higher, but we discovered… we checked that it was also happening on Sepolia, probably on Olski too, so yeah.

54
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.390
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Don't know why.

55
00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.500
Barnabas: What about on Fusaka Devna 3?

56
00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.570
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I haven't checked there. I haven't checked there.

57
00:12:52.130 --> 00:13:00.549
Barnabas: Because that would be a platform where we could do end-to-end tests, basically, and validate that if our center picks for it, then…

58
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.129
Barnabas: We would be able to validate it.

59
00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:11.549
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, I don't know how to actually catch this, maybe having,

60
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:20.420
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): A metric that tracks how many rejection happens on every subnet.

61
00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:24.579
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Which can tell you, even in testnets.

62
00:13:25.510 --> 00:13:37.980
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): DevNets, that's there. There is something wrong sent over the network, but otherwise, everything is normally recorded as a debug log, so it's kind of hidden, so…

63
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:39.030
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): If…

64
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:48.910
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The good thing has been distributed on the network anyway, you don't see that there was something wrong sent over anyway.

65
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.939
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, maybe, maybe some, some kind of metric.

66
00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:55.200
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): could help.

67
00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.160
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): In the future.

68
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:00.130
Barnabas: Yeah, Manu?

69
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:12.869
Manu: Yeah, I wanted to say that I also, saw, a lot of, Lodstar, peers, passing, 0.6000Z cell proof.

70
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.600
Manu: And, yes, I said this already on the Discord, but…

71
00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.379
Manu: for example, for Prism, if,

72
00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:37.040
Manu: PRISM does get blobs V2 from the EL, and if, for some reason, the EL gives bad proofs, then in this case, PRISM won't verify the proof, because we trust the execution layer.

73
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:45.130
Manu: And then, this proof will be, will be, you know, in, in, in,

74
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:52.109
Manu: data column sidecars, and then Prism will send data column sidecars with bad proof, and will be, you know.

75
00:14:52.750 --> 00:15:02.639
Manu: And that messages will be rejected by other peers, and at the end, peers will reject… will, don't score and eventually, disconnect,

76
00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:10.179
Manu: For example, Pierre, who, who, who did the… gets blocked V2 because of, potentially, bad…

77
00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:12.580
Manu: from the, from the ear.

78
00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:22.260
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, and also Teku, and probably most of other kinds will do that. So…

79
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:31.149
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): If the source of this problem was the EL, maybe a test on the engine API,

80
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:40.160
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): on every CL… EL client could have triggered this, detected this.

81
00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:46.180
Barnabas: Yeah, Nicole?

82
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:55.179
nflaig: Yeah, so I think Matt is not here, so I can give a quick update what we found so far. So there is not really an evidence that it's from the EL yet.

83
00:15:55.500 --> 00:16:07.479
nflaig: We had a bug, that we are fixing, where basically we would, call get blob32 or reconstruct cells, and then we import the block, and then…

84
00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:25.930
nflaig: What we do internally, we clean up the block input, which basically tracks the columns and the block, and then when we would receive another column for the block over Gossip, we would restart the whole process, because we internally, the code was already pruned.

85
00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:31.610
nflaig: So we would call get blob32 again for that data, even though the block is already…

86
00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.280
nflaig: Fully there and, imported.

87
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:41.649
nflaig: And we think the zero boost might be some internal buffer that gets overwritten due to that, while we are still…

88
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.859
nflaig: Flushing the data to gossip.

89
00:16:49.560 --> 00:17:01.849
nflaig: And maybe regarding the, why we didn't see this on the DevNet, so there was a pretty major refactoring we did about a month ago, so this code wasn't really running for that long on the DevNet also.

90
00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:06.630
Barnabas: Yeah, mono?

91
00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.940
Manu: Sorry, I just forget to lower my hand.

92
00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:24.150
Barnabas: Have you noticed any of these zero proofs, floating around that were not published by Lodestar?

93
00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.290
Manu: Yeah, mainly by those stories.

94
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.750
Manu: But not only.

95
00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:32.940
Manu: But mainly.

96
00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:36.739
Barnabas: What does that mean?

97
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:39.160
Manu: I mean… Which other…

98
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.530
Barnabas: Which other client have you detected?

99
00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:48.420
Manu: Yeah, I saw at least one Sprism, at least… exactly one Sprism, I saw exactly one Sprism.

100
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:55.290
Manu: And that's why, because of that, I assume… assume,

101
00:17:55.410 --> 00:18:00.149
Manu: a bad EL proof coming from the EL may be the cause.

102
00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:05.099
Manu: But it's, yeah, it's very majority of time, it's lost our, and…

103
00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:13.699
Manu: And sometimes it's not Lustar, sometimes it is other clients, including Prism. But… Yes, let's say 0.

104
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.739
Manu: Between 0 and 1% of the time, it's not close to.

105
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:25.540
Barnabas: Okay, do we feel like this is a critical problem going forward?

106
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.069
Manu: I don't think so, because in this case, just the…

107
00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.349
Manu: The, the, the sidecar is just rejected.

108
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:35.809
Manu: And that's all.

109
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.759
Manu: And so the 40 peer may be,

110
00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:49.769
Manu: Don't scroll… is don't scroll and may be disconnected, but the sidecars, the 40 sidecars, are not gossiped over the network by the first player.

111
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:00.810
Barnabas: Right.

112
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:08.969
Barnabas: Do we have any other Fusaka-related topics?

113
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:18.859
Barnabas: In case not, then maybe we can move on to the AI gospel testing.

114
00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:27.390
Barnabas: Anyone from NetherMind or the testing team, Ari, could you give us an update how everything is going?

115
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:46.790
Kamil Chodoła: I can give an anomaly to that. So, for now, we are focusing on stabilizing the entire environment, that's why last week, we decided to switch to 100 megas blocks only, and this is better right now, results are much more stable, and

116
00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:49.899
Kamil Chodoła: The feedback loop is faster, that's a good thing.

117
00:19:50.050 --> 00:20:02.370
Kamil Chodoła: Other than that, working on adding newest version of EST compute scenarios, but having some issues with generated Genesis files, working with Louis on that.

118
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:07.480
Kamil Chodoła: And in the meantime, we are working together with Marius…

119
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:19.340
Kamil Chodoła: on some repricing branches and repricing machine, where we're only testing the… and very… grasping the inputs for potential repricings for Glamster now.

120
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:35.649
Kamil Chodoła: And from stateful scenarios point of view, here I need to refresh the machine, which is testing SAN and other stateful tests on top of LoadNet, because there was some issue out there, and it is down for now, but I need to revive it.

121
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.320
Kamil Chodoła: And in the meantime, everything,

122
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:48.040
Kamil Chodoła: is progressing, I would say, in proper direction. We need to improve our metrics collection to have a better input for repricings moving forward.

123
00:20:52.070 --> 00:21:03.359
Parithosh Jayanthi: Also, to note that clients starting this week will be releasing with 60 million as the default, so as and when the network starts updating, we should see the gas limit go up.

124
00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:05.640
Parithosh Jayanthi: Or at least starts being booted up.

125
00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.640
Kamil Chodoła: I see already some blocks on 35+, again, so…

126
00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:20.549
Ben Adams: We may… we may have an issue, because…

127
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:26.200
Ben Adams: I think the gas limit was voted up last time, rather than using the defaults, so…

128
00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:32.389
Ben Adams: It may be more resistant to going up if everybody's manually set their value.

129
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.290
Ben Adams: We might need to reach out.

130
00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.840
Ben Adams: For the community.

131
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:46.820
Kamil Chodoła: And what will happen, probably, will be that we will… I'll update at once on…

132
00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.110
Parithosh Jayanthi: Outlook, right?

133
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:54.990
Parithosh Jayanthi: Also, the… yeah, the good thing is there's a hard focus, so… worst case, we'll hit the gas limit up a bit then.

134
00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:03.750
Ben Adams: Yeah, but if they've used flags to set it to 45, then… Little stat, 45.

135
00:22:06.850 --> 00:22:10.539
Barnabas: I think most users will be using, the default flags.

136
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:16.699
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, but it is worth reaching out. We can do a round of that once the releases are out.

137
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:19.520
Barnabas: Yeah.

138
00:22:21.150 --> 00:22:25.380
Barnabas: Okay, so is there anything else for estimate testing?

139
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:37.280
Barnabas: But then, let's, get into grump serum testing.

140
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.600
Barnabas: Stefan, would you have an update for us?

141
00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:56.130
Stefan Starflinger: So the definite, is pretty ready. Nethermind, and Russ have signaled that they're ready with the last changes from the call on about.

142
00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:03.399
Stefan Starflinger: But Geth, and PESO, I think they haven't signaled yet, and I think we might have also a testing update.

143
00:23:05.170 --> 00:23:11.179
Stefan Starflinger: Do you have a… Testing update regarding the latest tests.

144
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.499
raxhvl: Yeah, I've posted it in the chat.

145
00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:27.919
Stefan Starflinger: Okay, that sounds pretty promising. I think as soon as that's ready, we can start with the DevNet.

146
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:32.629
Jared Wasinger: Sorry, but what do you mean by signaling in this context?

147
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:36.230
Jared Wasinger: I mean…

148
00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:40.780
Jared Wasinger: Like, when you say the clients have signaled that they're ready or not.

149
00:23:42.210 --> 00:23:44.019
Stefan Starflinger: Oh, I…

150
00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:52.979
Stefan Starflinger: in the blog access list chat, I tagged all the client teams and asked to give, like, a thumbs up when they're ready.

151
00:23:53.240 --> 00:24:00.540
Jared Wasinger: Oh, okay, gotcha, yeah. I'll do that, I think Geth should… Geth should be ready, yeah.

152
00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:09.429
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, so that would be nice if, when you're ready, also when Biso's ready, and then I will, start the, DevNet.

153
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.400
Stefan Starflinger: I think that's it from my side.

154
00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.420
Barnabas: Yeah, Mark?

155
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.570
Marc: Oh yeah, I just had a quick question about these, test results.

156
00:24:24.670 --> 00:24:35.850
Marc: So it's from… are those, test fixtures up to date? So I know we agreed to make some, kind of, change just before the DevNet,

157
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:39.690
Marc: And I'm not sure if that's included or not in those tests.

158
00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:50.759
felipe: Rahul, I saw you left and came back. Did you catch that question?

159
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.540
raxhvl: No, no, I just lost it. Could you repeat that?

160
00:24:54.110 --> 00:25:03.919
Marc: Yeah, I was just asking if those, tests, 1.3.0, is that up to date? Because, yeah, the Coinbase change, is actually.

161
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:07.610
raxhvl: No, I think… Yeah, there is a new release coming up.

162
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.930
Marc: Okay.

163
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:09.880
raxhvl: That'll be likely today or tomorrow.

164
00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:13.480
raxhvl: That includes close to, I think, 25 tests.

165
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.770
raxhvl: Yeah, so that should cover everything.

166
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.100
Marc: Okay, great. Thank you.

167
00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:28.840
felipe: Yeah, and the updates to the Coinbase are also there too, so it does update some of the older tests, according to the breakout.

168
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:31.190
felipe: Session conversations.

169
00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:41.759
draganrakita: Are those 100% passing on that new test suit, or on old one?

170
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:55.520
raxhvl: The results are from the previous test. This does not include the Coinbase test, so we'll… we'll update the results today, once we have a new release.

171
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:11.829
Barnabas: Okay, great. Is there anything else regarding… Doctor back to this testimon?

172
00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.940
Stefan Starflinger: I think that sums it up.

173
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:24.300
Barnabas: Okay, anyone would have any updates regarding EPBS?

174
00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:50.459
Mario Vega: Hey, so, I don't have that many updates, but, Justin did ping me before the meeting that he won't be able to join. Basically, the only updates is that there are two new releases on the consistent specs. One is 1.6.0, and the other is 1.6.0 beta number 2.

175
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:57.160
Mario Vega: So, that's… that's basically it. Just… just please give it a look. I, I see that there's a comprehensive,

176
00:26:57.300 --> 00:27:06.139
Mario Vega: readme, at least in the 1.6.0 beta 2. So yes, I think that should give you more context. But yeah, more than that, I'm not… I'm not sure.

177
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:18.139
Barnabas: Yeah, I also haven't heard any update from buying teams, signaling that they would be ready for DevNet Zero, so…

178
00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:24.860
Barnabas: I don't think we can do, APB as a net0 before NetConnect, but maybe…

179
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:39.779
Barnabas: all DevNet Zero could actually happen sometime this week, and then we would have something, running throughout DevConnect, and then we should target for, APBS DevNet late November, early December.

180
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:51.350
Barnabas: Any other, questions or updates regarding Glamster then?

181
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:14.279
Barnabas: Maybe then we can talk about, the mainnet client releases. We heard from Prism already that they would not be ready, for today.

182
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:19.869
Barnabas: But, I would like to hear from every single client team if they could make it.

183
00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:33.119
Kamil Chodoła: So, for NaturMind, we are working on release right now, but we are facing some unexpected regression around sync,

184
00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:39.059
Kamil Chodoła: So… Worst case scenario will release today, minimize the version.

185
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.759
Kamil Chodoła: And we'll have hotfix probably in the coming days.

186
00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:57.500
Andrew Ashikhmin: For Aragon, we've released 3.2.2 today, which has Fusaka on mainnet.

187
00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:06.980
Barnabas: Can you guys also confirm everybody, set the gas limit to 60 million by default?

188
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:07.870
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yup.

189
00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.010
Andrew Ashikhmin: It was said in the previous patch release.

190
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.450
Andrew Ashikhmin: So, yeah, it's sad.

191
00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:25.070
Barnabas: Okay, great. And, any CL teams?

192
00:29:56.090 --> 00:30:02.129
Barnabas: If you're reading the chat, I see that, the expiration will not release, and…

193
00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:07.220
Barnabas: Taku is in progress, I'm gonna start his working RNAs as well.

194
00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:15.420
Barnabas: Oh, I think it looks like, we're not gonna have a complete list of releases by the end of today.

195
00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.760
Barnabas: We should really try to do a deadline by…

196
00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.940
Barnabas: I would say Wednesday this week.

197
00:30:23.290 --> 00:30:30.819
Barnabas: And if we cannot meet that deadline, then, we might actually need to consider rescheduling main network.

198
00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:35.769
Barnabas: Just in… in case to have that, for today in between.

199
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.269
Barnabas: releases, but… Yeah, I really don't want to have that.

200
00:30:55.510 --> 00:31:07.499
Barnabas: Yeah, is the 5th of, 5th of November as a final deadline would make sense, and then I think we could have the blog post out by Thursday, maybe by ECD.

201
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:21.520
Barnabas: I haven't talked with Alex, when we wanted to check out the blog post, but I think, this week would be very, very good.

202
00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:42.319
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Point is that we sh… we don't want to release if, for… by any chance, there is some… there is still a…

203
00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:46.019
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): As a condition in which we could postpone.

204
00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:51.640
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, it could be tricky, then, to… Whatever colder it is.

205
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:57.480
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We could, but there might be a noise.

206
00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:14.369
Barnabas: Yeah, I think if we can have all the clients raised by the 5th, we really shouldn't have a problem, still forcing, maybe not on the 3rd of December.

207
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:25.910
Barnabas: I'm just a bit worried that if we do slide it, for, like, next week, there are gonna be further delays, yeah, due to DevConnect.

208
00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:31.809
Barnabas: And that could actually lead to potentially, causing some issues down the line.

209
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.070
Barnabas: Because we did want to leave at least one month between now.

210
00:32:36.190 --> 00:32:37.960
Barnabas: Reason, Minnet.

211
00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:51.009
Barnabas: I think the main, the main question here is,

212
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:56.399
Barnabas: If PRISM would be, if PRISM thinks that they would be ready by Wednesday.

213
00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:03.179
Manu: Yeah, so, in the best case, we…

214
00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:08.630
Manu: In the best case, yes, we… we find the… we fix the bug today.

215
00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.140
Manu: Which is a third.

216
00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:14.309
Manu: And we need a few days for, for soaking.

217
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:24.340
Manu: So yes, fifths will be the really best, best, best case, in my opinion, for a release date.

218
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:30.890
Manu: It's more, reasonable to expect a release this week, but maybe not on Wednesday.

219
00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.190
Manu: Yep.

220
00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:51.019
Manu: Yeah, yeah, yeah, so, I mean, yes, so in the best case, release candidate on 5th. If we fix a bug today, we can have a release candidate on 5th.

221
00:33:51.250 --> 00:33:56.039
Manu: Yes, but maybe not a release on this day.

222
00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.350
Manu: Yep.

223
00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.520
Barnabas: Yeah, maybe Lighthouse can also comment?

224
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.570
Barnabas: Not sure if anyone from that house is here.

225
00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:21.210
Barnabas: I'm quite sure you find anyone.

226
00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:22.870
Barnabas: And the call from Nathan.

227
00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:47.330
Barnabas: Yep, met you.

228
00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:57.939
Matthew Keil: So, we identified a bug as well, that didn't show up until we got to the larger network. We've figured out what the issue is.

229
00:34:58.269 --> 00:35:02.009
Matthew Keil: And we're in the process of also soaking a fix.

230
00:35:02.149 --> 00:35:09.549
Matthew Keil: And talking about it actively. So we should be able to get the release out, but that is also kind of a…

231
00:35:10.649 --> 00:35:17.529
Matthew Keil: by the 5th is our goal, but just wanted to put it out in the world that it's a best-case scenario.

232
00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:22.770
Barnabas: Thank you.

233
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:34.539
Barnabas: Yeah, I think we should, stick to the original timeline of the 3rd of December, let's push out the releases, and

234
00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:42.460
Barnabas: we need to re-evaluate by Occo Devs on Thursday if we really don't have all the

235
00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:49.669
Barnabas: all the major releases by, all core devs, then, we might need to discuss an alternative deadline.

236
00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.050
Barnabas: Or, main net.

237
00:35:52.230 --> 00:36:00.450
Barnabas: But I think we should stick to the, urgent schedule for now, because, yeah, the 30-day is,

238
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:06.080
Barnabas: It's almost there, with, having already settled by the 5th.

239
00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.049
Barnabas: But if, by Thursday, all coordinates, we cannot,

240
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:17.000
Barnabas: we cannot have the releases, then… then I think an alternative proposal will have to come up.

241
00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.340
Barnabas: Does that sound reasonable?

242
00:36:21.450 --> 00:36:23.020
Barnabas: For, everyone?

243
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:44.730
Barnabas: Okay, great. And I just got a confirmation from Alex that we're gonna be targeting the blog post also by Thursday.

244
00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.820
Barnabas: So, yeah, just please keep working on your releases.

245
00:36:51.220 --> 00:37:00.310
Barnabas: Okay, there's one more topic that Mario wanted to bring up, the testing complexity assessment checklist.

246
00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.529
Barnabas: Could you please, bring it up, Mario?

247
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.890
Barnabas: If you're here.

248
00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:13.850
Mario Vega: Yeah, of course. Yeah, it's very, it's very quick. So, we are gathering information on, the…

249
00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:28.959
Mario Vega: proposed for inclusion EIPs for Amsterdam, and we've seen that there's a ton of them, and so, we have a tracker for this, I just showed you the link. We're gonna use a checklist, basically, to follow the,

250
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:40.200
Mario Vega: to try to determine how the testing complexity for a given EIP is, like, either high or low. This is only for the execution layer at the moment.

251
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:53.979
Mario Vega: But, in any case, if you want to jump in and chime in into this issue, please do so in regards of any EIPs that you think we should prioritize.

252
00:37:54.030 --> 00:38:04.779
Mario Vega: Because you see more impact of this EVM EIP, just please go into the issue and comment on there, and we'll try to prioritize,

253
00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:16.869
Mario Vega: to assess the complexity of the testing of this EVM EIP, so we can move it forward, and maybe even start with the specification implementation, and also the testing implementation.

254
00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:19.080
Mario Vega: But yeah, that's basically it.

255
00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:27.519
Barnabas: This is great, Mario, thank you. Would you be open to also include the CL EIPs in here?

256
00:38:27.830 --> 00:38:33.580
Barnabas: I know that they would be targeting different kind of tests, but… We only have a,

257
00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:38.829
Barnabas: very few, I think maybe 3 CL-specific EIPs in Amsterdam.

258
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:42.770
Mario Vega: Yeah, absolutely. I mean, if you have comments on the…

259
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:59.159
Mario Vega: on the CL EIPs that you want, that you want, that you think we should prioritize, just… you just feel free to leave them here. We'll try to redirect this to the proper people to… to… for them to… to start implementing or, assessing the complexity of an EIP, yeah.

260
00:38:59.160 --> 00:38:59.800
Barnabas: Yep.

261
00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:10.210
Barnabas: So, would you expect, that each team goes through all the IPs, and assigns someone to it, or…

262
00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:20.140
Mario Vega: So, yeah, that's it, that's the question, right? So there's too many EIPs, in my opinion. So what I'm asking here is that if we can, like.

263
00:39:20.370 --> 00:39:31.489
Mario Vega: get a sentiment from the rest of the core devs for Glamstagram EIPs, just to see which ones we should prioritize on… on assessing.

264
00:39:31.710 --> 00:39:39.029
Mario Vega: based on their feeling on which one will have the better impact in the EVM,

265
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:44.319
Mario Vega: I think, I think that's… that's what we should, like, lead with, with those EIPs, yeah.

266
00:39:53.390 --> 00:39:59.490
lightclient: I feel like the problem is that we have 10 EIPs that are just focused on pricing-related concerns.

267
00:40:11.140 --> 00:40:15.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: Matt, can you clarify how is this a problem in this regard specifically?

268
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:31.940
lightclient: I mean, we want someone to, like, deeply look at all these EIPs, and we also want to try and find the things that are impactful, but if we're just going… you know, if we're going to do the pricing, which is seemingly, like, highest priority, I don't even know if we have the bandwidth to also be doing

269
00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.440
lightclient: that many impactful things to the EVM on top of that, that are not related to pricing.

270
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:47.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, but that seems more like a general folk scoping kind of

271
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:53.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: Argument and discussion, whereas for, like, specifically the testing impact assessment.

272
00:40:53.740 --> 00:41:04.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, yeah, I would focus on basically figuring out what are the first batch of, like, most important, highest impact ones that we should try to get a feeling for first.

273
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:08.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: And that probably includes some repricing, maybe includes some non-repricing ones.

274
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.330
lightclient: It just feels like a lot to me. I feel like we should have…

275
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:21.980
lightclient: some clear prioritization of the EIPs before we just… Analyze all of them.

276
00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.760
lightclient: But if people feel like we have the bandwidth to do it, then we can do it.

277
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:39.299
Mario Vega: You know, I completely agree with you, Lagland. Yeah, that's what I… I feel like we're overwhelmed at the moment with the amount of EIPs that we have to analyze.

278
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.439
Łukasz Rozmej: So, what I wanted to get from.

279
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:46.490
Mario Vega: the rest of the core labs, is there's… if there's, like, a clear sign of which ones we should prioritize.

280
00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.609
Mario Vega: Yeah, I completely agree, this is too much.

281
00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:57.850
Łukasz Rozmej: Nevermind team went through, I think, all the APs, maybe there were some newly…

282
00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:17.699
Łukasz Rozmej: We went through all this, we find, and we can share some of our views. We… I think it's not yet, like, published so far, but we can at least, if we want, give you, like.

283
00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:20.899
Barnabas: It's been pretty hard to hear you in the past.

284
00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:21.880
Łukasz Rozmej: What?

285
00:42:23.370 --> 00:42:24.080
Łukasz Rozmej: Okay.

286
00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:24.680
Barnabas: Nope.

287
00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:29.590
Barnabas: Maybe you can give a… just leave some, text in the chat?

288
00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:33.150
Barnabas: Because your audio is cutting out.

289
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:34.430
Łukasz Rozmej: I'm driving.

290
00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:35.300
Barnabas: Okay.

291
00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:44.940
Marc: Yeah, he was just saying the team's gone through all of the different EIPs, and, we're in the process of writing something up that we can share soon.

292
00:42:46.690 --> 00:43:04.880
Barnabas: Yeah, I think it would be good if some bigger teams would be able to, like, give the other teams a heads up of, like, which are the EIPs that they would consider kicking out right away, decorate as fast as possible, so that other teams wouldn't need to

293
00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:09.600
Barnabas: basically chew through those EIPs, and I think that would be very, very good.

294
00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:35.860
Barnabas: Could we have the Netherland list open, or, like, publicly available for everyone, and then maybe we can already start kicking

295
00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.930
Barnabas: AIPs out on this week's, Occo Devs call.

296
00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:44.570
Marc: Yeah, we can post it somewhere soon.

297
00:43:46.110 --> 00:43:47.830
Barnabas: That would be good. Thank you.

298
00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:53.979
Barnabas: Anyone else have any other topic that they would like to discuss?

299
00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:00.729
lightclient: I think just last thing on this… For the testing team?

300
00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:04.099
lightclient: I think the highest priority is the repricing EAPs.

301
00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:08.140
lightclient: So, if you're still waiting for more signal, I think that's…

302
00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:12.010
lightclient: The clearest signal to me is that we need to look at these and figure out

303
00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:20.429
lightclient: What makes sense, where the complexities are gonna be, what the interplay between them is going to be, and then when clients start releasing their preferences, we can start looking at the non…

304
00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:22.449
lightclient: Free pricing related stuff.

305
00:44:32.910 --> 00:44:34.469
Barnabas: Yep. Charger?

306
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:40.840
Fredrik: Yeah, this is unrelated to… to that, but,

307
00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:55.589
Fredrik: Yeah, as we're moving towards the mainnetwork, we are… we also have the mainnet upgrade and incident response team plan, which Alex has been working on.

308
00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.579
Fredrik: You can find it here.

309
00:44:58.070 --> 00:45:01.360
Fredrik: Basically, it will be the same as we did for

310
00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:08.170
Fredrik: the idea of this is that we do it the same way as we do with Pectra, where each of the client teams sound

311
00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:15.910
Fredrik: Shared roles. Teams have, basically coordinators assigned to,

312
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.960
Fredrik: As points of contacts, so,

313
00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:25.979
Fredrik: It's probably a good idea for client teams to at least start thinking about

314
00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.009
Fredrik: Who should be the primary coordinator? Who should be the backup?

315
00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:38.660
Fredrik: Coordinator, etc, and yeah, it's something that we're gonna have to be… Doing in the coming weeks.

316
00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:44.369
Barnabas: Yeah, could you guys please make a PR to this,

317
00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:53.990
Barnabas: more than fine if you feel like you could be your client team's primary or backup coordinator, and you can start merging in those PRs.

318
00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:02.170
Barnabas: Or, yeah, possibly just reach out to Alex. I'm not sure if there's an open PR about this already.

319
00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.720
Fredrik: I don't think there is… he's… I don't think he's opened a PR yet.

320
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:11.439
Barnabas: Yeah, because I just saw that this was at work.

321
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.310
Fredrik: Yep.

322
00:46:24.590 --> 00:46:33.070
Barnabas: Okay, so I think we should merge this, into the upstream repo as soon as possible, and then, client teams can make a PR to that.

323
00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.380
Barnabas: Thanks for bringing it up.

324
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:43.690
Barnabas: Okay, is there anything else?

325
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:55.630
Barnabas: Okay, Slat, good luck with all the releases, and well, hopefully everyone

326
00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:59.150
Barnabas: We'll be ready by, Wednesday or Thursday this week.

327
00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:01.559
Barnabas: And see you all on Thursday.

328
00:47:04.090 --> 00:47:05.220
Manu: Video, thank you.

329
00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:06.740
Stefan Starflinger: Thank you.

330
00:47:07.110 --> 00:47:07.550
Andrew Ashikhmin: My buddy.

331
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:08.249
Mario Vega: Thank you, goodbye.
