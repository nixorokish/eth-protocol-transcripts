00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:30.880
Sam: Hello, hello.

2
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.430
michael curry: Hey, Sam, what's going on?

3
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.999
Sam: Not too much, not too much. How about yourself?

4
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:45.210
michael curry: Oh, the same, just, kind of getting ready for the, the holiday, here from California. Where are you in the world?

5
00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.730
Sam: I'm in Canada, Ottawa specifically. Oh, okay, run on, yeah, good spot.

6
00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:51.640
Sam: It's not too bad

7
00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.229
Sam: Snow melted, so, you know, back to fall weather instead of middle of winter in November.

8
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.100
michael curry: Right? Yeah, as that goes, yeah, for sure.

9
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.450
Sam: I'm just gonna be muted right now, I have a 3D printer going in the background.

10
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.789
michael curry: No, no worries, go for it.

11
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.850
Sam: Seems like we're gonna have a pretty quiet today.

12
00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.769
Sam: Pretty quiet day again today.

13
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:15.270
Sam: Considering the lack of agenda on the last couple of calls, I've been thinking of just moving to an on-demand meeting format.

14
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.240
Sam: I doubt anybody here is gonna object.

15
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:38.170
Sam: Alright, unless you guys want to talk about anything, I'm gonna call it here, and

16
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.419
Sam: We'll see you whenever the next meeting happens to be.

17
00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:59.399
michael curry: Hey, Sam, just a quick one, because I'm a new person here for the group, so I was wondering if folks can point me in the right direction to figure out how to, start working with folks that are as interested as I am in the adoption of ERC681.

18
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:14.370
michael curry: and related proposals. I don't see anything that's clear to me inside Discord that's, like, a channel or a group for that, but I'm looking just for the, you know, the wisdom here from the folks on this call to be able to point me in the right direction, since I'm new to the group.

19
00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:25.900
Sam: Honestly, the group used to be a lot more active, and it's died off in the past couple of months. I think most people are just kind of working heads down, and there hasn't been much to coordinate on.

20
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.080
Sam: As for looking for adoption.

21
00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:39.859
Sam: Unfortunately, it's gonna be a lot of talking to contacts at individual wallets. There are quite a few in the Discord. I don't think…

22
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:47.180
Sam: People would be too upset if you added… if you acted them directly, just to see if you wanted to get their opinion on stuff.

23
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:50.549
Sam: That's about all I can suggest, really.

24
00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:55.620
Sam: Cool. Are you in the Ethereum Wallet Nexus Telegram, by any chance?

25
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.899
michael curry: I don't think I am.

26
00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:01.829
Sam: Okay, I cannot invite people to that, but I will…

27
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:08.699
Sam: Definitely try to make that happen. If you could just poke me on Discord to remind me, I will do that.

28
00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.349
Sam: Brilliant. Yeah, really appreciate it. Thanks, guys.

29
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.780
Sam: Yeah, no problem. Take care.

30
00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:14.590
michael curry: Alright, later on, enjoy.
