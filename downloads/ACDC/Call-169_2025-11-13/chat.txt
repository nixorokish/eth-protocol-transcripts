we are concerned, so we want to set them as soon as possible given the blob count, and presumably do something similar with the payload depending on gas limit or payload size for example
00:30:23	Trent:	Reacted to "2w sounds very optim..." with 👍🏼
00:30:53	kev and pandaops:	Replying to "2w sounds very optim..."

Yeah but that’s usually not compressed in one stretch and often interlaced with PR reviews and getting input from a wider range of audiences. Barely any EIP can be done in a 2w timeline extension to the overall fork tbh, let alone a big one.

i see. i know it was suggested to have them be dynamic but didn't know that was being seriously considered
00:33:54	NC:	Replying to "2w sounds very optim…"
@kev and pandaops yea I understand, there’s additional effort for spec writing and reviewing. I think the 2 weeks refers to additional time spent provided epbs and focil are implemented, and the related spec and test infrastructure is ready
00:34:22	Potuz:	Replying to "doesn't this depend ..."

it doesn't need to be in Glamsterdam and it is not a hardfork so it's easy to test and implement after the fork
00:34:54	Potuz:	Replying to "doesn't this depend ..."

having the deadline be dependent on the payload size or the number of KZG commitments is trivial to implement and ship, probably harder to test and set the right parameters
00:35:00	kev and pandaops:	Reacted to "@kev and pandaops ye..." with 👍🏽
00:35:29	Potuz:	Replying to "doesn't this depend ..."

00:37:10	soispoke:	Ok so summary for FOCIL:
3 teams explicitly want to SFI it
2 teams expressed conditional support (as in support with caveats, mainly around fork complexity and timelines) 
1 team would rather DFI it
00:37:15	Potuz:	8061 is a bit more complex, 8071's changes are localized it should be much simpler to deploy and test
00:37:19	Dustin:	Replying to "2w sounds very opt..."

So if FOCIL has already implemented, then it takes 2 weeks, that's the intent? I think the idea is, from a baseline of no FOCIL

+1 I think we’re realistically talking about a fork 3-6mos later if we add focil in vs not.

on the CL side: support for 8045, 8062, 8068 on a B-tier

support for pushing FOCIL to Heka from abc, with strong support for it in Glammy from Stakers Union. Wallet dev only had an opinion on an EL EIP

00:43:43	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "Screenshot 2025-11-13 at 09.18.50.png"

8062 is not necessarily unfair given that 0x02 already pay substantially for their withdrawals and that 0x01 skim withdrawals also cost resources which are not paid for. 8068 would be nice but we argue that we can try to compensate by doing 8062 a bit stronger to get a simpler change cover for both.

However focil and epbs both include changes to fork choice / STF and  new messages/topics as Dustin highlighted. So there are more possibilities for testing interactions between focil and ebps; 6s and focil seem more orthogonal to each other.

Strong agree, the equivalent here would be if we just decided that we want to do something different than focil (but with the same goal), which would be fine
00:48:45	Greg K | Lido:	Replying to "Screenshot 2025-11..."

Yep so the same resource (auto sweeping algo) is charged for 0x01 but not for 0x02, this is an asymmetry, which I can not see how can be rationalized.

This hurts trust-minimized permissionless staking such as Lido CSM and Rocket Pool, which rely on 0x01 (fixed bond requirement)

After lodestar!
00:50:40	kingy_sigp:	if the inertia here is FOCIL to Heka - that changes our appetite for some of the other EIPs. Generally, we're in favour of more targeted, shorter cadence hardforks - but acknowledge there is widespread community support for FOCIL
00:50:40	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "CR is important and ..."

We have FOCILR in EIP-8046 which extends on FOCIL. FOCILR offers strong censorship resistance. But that extension means we still benefit from shipping FOCIL first.

Not sure 6s slots and FOCIL are orthogonal since focil is time sensitive. IMO there will be some design/timing challenges to keep focil reliable. And yes, FOCIL will probably delay the fork (be it because of the testing complexity or the protocol design) but anyway, a 6 months fork is already not possible even with ePBS alone

The community delegates stewardship responsibility to core devs who work on this stuff full time. in most cases, they necessarily do not have the capacity to make informed decisions

The fee gives us a lever to lean into even more in the future. Say we start with fair fee (resource consumption wise) and it’s not sufficient, we can then decide to be more explicit and increase fee to very explicitly incentivize switching to 0x02 vals

Nothing is impossible, some things are unreasonable
01:12:33	kev and pandaops:	Replying to "Tbf, the community i..."

We don’t think it’s impossible, we think it comes with the risk of no fork in 2026 + higher complexity. it’s definitely possible given time.

01:12:54	Greg K | Lido:	Replying to "Screenshot 2025-11..."

If the goal is to switch to 0x02, then just incentivize switching (8068), penalizing 0x01 does not seem fair. 

It should be okay to have some validators of type 0x01 (by choice or necessity) don't see why they should pay a penalty for that
01:13:33	Francesco:	They can just switch though
01:13:35	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "Tbf, the community i..."

right, and THATs what we're not talking about, the prioritizing of fork cadence over fork content.

 Imo, even if we delay, we still risk piling up too much complexity with only a few ppl remaining deeply understanding the protocol.
01:15:29	Francesco:	90% consolidation would still mean 100k+ validators just for the remaining 10%, so a small minority would be putting a huge burden on the network

I think that ignores a lot of support for FOCIL. Credible commitment seems like a necessary condition for just DFI’ing FOCIL now, or need to go back to FOCIL conversation now.
01:26:05	Anders Elowsson:	To state in the comments what I said on 8068 also: I just want to make sure people understand that the way to earn the highest yield on Ethereum is to just run multiple 32.75 ETH validators at 33 EB. If we believe it is going to be too complex for people to fiddle with this and not worth the energy, then we can ignore that concern as well. 

And it may very well be too complex and we may not think people will do it. I think that could be a reasonable assumption. I just want it to have been understood and considered.
01:26:41	Caspar Schwarz-Schilling:	Replying to "It seems like too mu..."
