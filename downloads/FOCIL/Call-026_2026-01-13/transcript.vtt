00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.310
Jihoon: Hello guys, I think we can wait a few more minutes.

2
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.500
Matthew Keil: Is it my audio, or is nobody speaking?

3
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.940
Justin Florentine (Besu): It's not you, buddy.

4
00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:21.830
Jihoon: Yeah, we're just waiting a few more minutes until we have more people.

5
00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:23.399
Jihoon: I think we can wait below.

6
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:31.150
Jihoon: Yeah, I think we can start in a minute.

7
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.310
Jihoon: I guess.

8
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:40.579
Jihoon: People are busy, who are… Yeah, maybe. It's not the right time to… To also break out after…

9
00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:42.599
Jihoon: Happy New Year!

10
00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:47.269
Matthew Keil: I mean, if you want, I could tell jokes the whole hour. I can do that.

11
00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:51.510
Jihoon: Oh, the floor is yours, but you got only one minute.

12
00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:59.390
Matthew Keil: Although, I'm telling you, Justin, I'll give you a run for the money on the bubbliest mofo in the show. I'm just saying.

13
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.260
Justin Florentine (Besu): Do it, man. The more, the better.

14
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:03.800
Matthew Keil: Okay, cool.

15
00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.620
Matthew Keil: I don't have any jokes, though.

16
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:11.639
Matthew Keil: At least not ones that are safe for work.

17
00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.919
Jihoon: Right, that was a good one, I think.

18
00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:21.940
Jihoon: Alright, we are, 5 minutes in, so I think we can start.

19
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:33.760
Jihoon: Yeah, so hello everyone, welcome, and wishing you all a Happy New Year. This is Fossil Breakout 26.

20
00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.749
Jihoon: Though… Just wait a minute, let me check if we are on…

21
00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:45.619
Jihoon: Lite and YouTube. This is first time doing this without… Which is support…

22
00:14:51.830 --> 00:15:02.360
Jihoon: Wait a minute, we're not live on YouTube, let me quickly… Resolve this issue.

23
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:09.040
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, jokes are fair game, is what I'm hearing.

24
00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:12.920
Jihoon: I guess so.

25
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.050
Justin Florentine (Besu): My.

26
00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:19.780
Jihoon: -

27
00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.050
Justin Florentine (Besu): My neighbor planted, dogwood trees in his front yard.

28
00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.590
Justin Florentine (Besu): I'm not a huge fan of the bark.

29
00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.685
Matthew Keil: Oh…

30
00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:42.669
Matthew Keil: I was gonna go with Why Did the Chicken Cross the Road? but that one was even better.

31
00:15:50.290 --> 00:15:56.140
Justin Florentine (Besu): what, what kind of music do balloons hate?

32
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:59.989
Matthew Keil: I don't know, what kind?

33
00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:01.690
Justin Florentine (Besu): Pop.

34
00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:13.069
Matthew Keil: Oh… oh, that's double grown. You got two in a row. You're the dad joke king, officially.

35
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:15.869
Matthew Keil: Knock, knock.

36
00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:18.790
Justin Florentine (Besu): Who's there?

37
00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:21.320
Matthew Keil: Orange.

38
00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:22.960
Justin Florentine (Besu): Weren't you?

39
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:28.420
Matthew Keil: Oh, shoot, I screwed it up. Knock, knock, who's there?

40
00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:29.570
Justin Florentine (Besu): Banana.

41
00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:36.820
Matthew Keil: There you go. See, I didn't even have to tell you the joke, there it is.

42
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:43.429
Matthew Keil: Oh, that's it, I'm looking for dad jokes.

43
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.700
Matthew Keil: Don't threaten me with a good time.

44
00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.809
Jihoon: Sorry about this.

45
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:15.019
Jihoon: Technical issue, so, I was told that…

46
00:17:15.149 --> 00:17:19.409
Jihoon: We… we're not gonna get support from

47
00:17:19.949 --> 00:17:31.769
Jihoon: Either your cakeholders starting this year, And… I haven't… Ran, breakout, And, you know, streaming,

48
00:17:32.369 --> 00:17:44.599
Jihoon: live YouTube stream on my own, so I thought that it would be automatically, somehow, like, magically generated, but it seems… obviously it's not, so I just asked.

49
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.049
Matthew Keil: Coach J.

50
00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:47.300
Jihoon: She can buff us up, so…

51
00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:52.050
Jihoon: I mean, she said that she will… She's checking up, and…

52
00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:55.760
Matthew Keil: Well, in the meantime…

53
00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.390
Jihoon: Yes, you got another joke?

54
00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:02.099
Matthew Keil: Why was the stadium so cool?

55
00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:05.219
Justin Florentine (Besu): It was filled.

56
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:08.000
Matthew Keil: It was filled with fans.

57
00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.090
Justin Florentine (Besu): Solid.

58
00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.429
Matthew Keil: Why did the frog take the bus to work?

59
00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:23.420
Matthew Keil: His car got towed.

60
00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:25.600
Justin Florentine (Besu): Haha. Toad.

61
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:43.490
Justin Florentine (Besu): Is… Jihoon, did Pooja say this is gonna be, like, a regular challenge moving forward? Do we need somebody to kind of fill in that gap and do that, you know, technical bit with the YouTube stuff?

62
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.870
Jihoon: I think I need to check that.

63
00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:57.729
Jihoon: she told me that, the EF told her that either Touma or I can…

64
00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.289
Jihoon: Take care of the live streaming thing.

65
00:19:01.390 --> 00:19:07.529
Jihoon: But I… At least… I haven't heard about it at all, so it's like…

66
00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:07.930
Matthew Keil: she's here.

67
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:08.550
Jihoon: I…

68
00:19:08.550 --> 00:19:09.699
Matthew Keil: Lucha just got here.

69
00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:10.990
Jihoon: I.

70
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:29.160
Pooja Ranjan: Hi, Jihoon, hi, yes. So, yes, Akash is joining shortly, and we will be live streaming this call. Sorry about the thing, I know, it was maybe a little late for you to know about it, but I was informed that it will be recorded and uploaded by default, so…

71
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:38.249
Jihoon: Oh, so… But upload it where? Is it YouTube?

72
00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:48.670
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, so, so EF team informed me that protocol support has automated some of the processes internally, so the

73
00:19:48.790 --> 00:20:07.800
Pooja Ranjan: breakout room meetings may not be streamed unless explicitly asked, and for that, there are some kind of settings that needs to be enabled when you create the agenda. But for this time, if you would like, we can go ahead and get streamed… get this meeting streamed, and

74
00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:10.929
Pooja Ranjan: Going forward, that can be taken care of.

75
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:23.360
Jihoon: Oh, I see, I see. Okay, okay, sorry for the confusion, guys, so I… yeah, this is a new thing that we haven't heard about, I haven't heard about, so…

76
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:33.789
Jihoon: So… as Akash and Poojais are already here, maybe we can… try out, YouTube Livestream.

77
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:42.130
Jihoon: Until by this meeting, and then we can just rely on the automated unload.

78
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:50.310
Jihoon: infrastructure, Starting the next breakout call, I guess. So… .

79
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.850
Pooja Ranjan: Good.

80
00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:56.069
Jihoon: Easter… Are we… are we live?

81
00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:02.519
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are live. Just give me a fire heads up so I can switch the screen.

82
00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:08.769
Pooja Ranjan: So we're live with the pre-stream, we can move over the screen whenever you say.

83
00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.730
Jihoon: Okay, yeah, we're good to go.

84
00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:15.830
Akash | ECH: Yeah, real life.

85
00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:18.780
Jihoon: Thank you.

86
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:25.720
Jihoon: All right, let's start this all over again. So, hello everyone, welcome, man.

87
00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:31.810
Jihoon: I was wishing you all a Happy New Year. This is, Foster Breakout 26.

88
00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:38.590
Jihoon: So… We are in the face of… proposing headliner candidates for Hagota.

89
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:43.269
Jihoon: We haven't written a proposal yet, but we'll write one soon.

90
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:50.949
Jihoon: While we were off last year, and early this year, we have shared foster readiness for Hagota article.

91
00:21:51.290 --> 00:21:52.600
Jihoon: Here's a link.

92
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:55.420
Jihoon: So, please have a look if you're interested.

93
00:21:58.310 --> 00:22:02.819
Jihoon: And Yeah, that's it for,

94
00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:14.590
Jihoon: what's it called? The proposal for Heikota stuff, and then I think we can move on to development updates, or research updates, if anyone has.

95
00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:26.850
Jihoon: Maybe I can go first. There are some changes made to the CL spec recently. So, I've updated fossil CL spec.

96
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:32.190
Jihoon: Here is the PR, if any CL dev is interested.

97
00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.010
Jihoon: There might be more changes coming, though, but… if I…

98
00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:49.719
Jihoon: make any changes to the fossil spec that I'm gonna share so that people can update their prototypes if they want to.

99
00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:56.720
Jihoon: So, yeah, that's it from my end. Does anyone have any… Updates to share?

100
00:23:22.510 --> 00:23:27.640
Matthew Keil: Did have just a quick question, regarding the interop stuff.

101
00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:35.100
Matthew Keil: No specifics, though, obviously. But, it's my understanding we're gonna do some Hagoda interop.

102
00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:53.039
Matthew Keil: And I'm curious, only because I can't actually make it to the interop this year, for scheduling reasons, are we gonna livestream that stuff? And is there a way to participate remotely, or do we need to have a representative there?

103
00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:05.620
Jihoon: well… I haven't been any interrupt, so I'm probably not the best person to ask, but maybe…

104
00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.719
Jihoon: Justine, you wanna say something?

105
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:26.909
Justin Florentine (Besu): It's doable. Generally, we don't do that, but, we do… can do ad hoc, remote stuff. The challenge is always, you know, zooming a couple of participants into a large room with lots of other participants and people huddled around fairly poor microphones.

106
00:24:26.910 --> 00:24:27.760
Matthew Keil: Exactly.

107
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:34.730
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, we've done that in the past. You know, if you can grin and bear it, it's doable. We're happy to give it a shot.

108
00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:35.080
Matthew Keil: Okay.

109
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.729
Justin Florentine (Besu): I think fossil's important, I'm a booster, I'll bring a microphone.

110
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:50.739
Matthew Keil: Okay, and to be fair, we will have others, like, basically the rest of our team is gonna try to make it. I'm just slated to do H-star, and I know I just can't… I can't make it there this year.

111
00:24:51.020 --> 00:25:02.369
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, I mean, if you have specific points you'd like to have, you know, cared for, I'd be happy to advocate for you or your team, and try and present that best as possible.

112
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:19.159
Matthew Keil: If anything comes up, but honestly, it was just more that I know it's the… it's a valuable time in order to just get everybody together, huddled around, and so, like, we'll… we'll figure it out internally if we can find a second person that's also interested in the feature that can help out, and then we'll,

113
00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.329
Matthew Keil: We'll make sure we have someone there representing.

114
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:23.850
Justin Florentine (Besu): Cool.

115
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.190
Jihoon: Right, cool. Do we have any more questions?

116
00:25:49.770 --> 00:26:04.320
Subhasish: Hello, I have a question around, there was an, existing PR on, a rebase, a possible rebase, onto Glowers. Can I know what's the overall status of that PR?

117
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:09.720
Jihoon: So,

118
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:18.289
Jihoon: The PR, I think, I'll say we are… the PR itself is waiting for Fossil to become a…

119
00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.049
Jihoon: headliner for Hakota, or not.

120
00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:28.949
Jihoon: So… we need to become a headliner to march the PR.

121
00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:40.970
Jihoon: And implementation-wise, we don't have, as far as I know, we don't have any working PBS implementation, so that's why we are still based on Fulu, and…

122
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:45.150
Jihoon: We had, like, nearly 8 clients.

123
00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.239
Jihoon: based on the loop, but since…

124
00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:53.880
Jihoon: Many of them were built, like, many months ago, so they are not kind of…

125
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:58.060
Jihoon: working today, so if you try to run intro.

126
00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:04.080
Jihoon: Among those fully-based clients, then you're gonna see they are not working.

127
00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:16.669
Jihoon: But… And, yeah, so… I would say current status is just waiting for the decision to be made regarding

128
00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.989
Jihoon: Apostle has a headline up for Hagota.

129
00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:28.919
Jihoon: But the PR itself is quite, up-to-date, so if you just read it, then I think… I believe you can get the gist of the change.

130
00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:45.249
Subhasish: Right, so, on top of that, if, Fossil is selected as, the headliner, then, would that PR be, again, updated, because I think the glowess, has been updated.

131
00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.999
Subhasish: A lot, maybe.

132
00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:58.290
Jihoon: Yes, that's true. So, beloise itself is… Still incorporating spec changes.

133
00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:07.080
Jihoon: And I haven't reflected those changes into that PR, I just wanted to wait a bit until we freeze global spec.

134
00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:14.190
Jihoon: So, yeah, you're right. Once we freeze below us back, I can update the PR based on

135
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.990
Jihoon: the latest Gloss spec, and then…

136
00:28:18.490 --> 00:28:26.340
Jihoon: once we have working PBS implementation, after a few DevNets, once we feel like it is okay to

137
00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:33.820
Jihoon: rebase fossil implementation on top of it, then we were gonna have prototypes on top of Goloas.

138
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.860
Subhasish: Right, right, got it.

139
00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:54.179
Matthew Keil: From a timing perspective, do we know when the… the Hagoda, headliner process is gonna happen? I don't remember hearing a timeline for that.

140
00:28:55.530 --> 00:29:06.480
Jihoon: As I remember it, by early February, we are proposing headliner candidates, and then.

141
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.180
Matthew Keil: Okay.

142
00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.299
Jihoon: In February, we're gonna select one.

143
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:12.559
Jihoon: one for CL, one for Yale, I guess. But…

144
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.660
Matthew Keil: Okay, so by March…

145
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.080
Jihoon: different.

146
00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.069
Matthew Keil: should have clarity.

147
00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:17.750
Jihoon: Yeah. Yes, I believe so.

148
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:36.970
Matthew Keil: And then we could start rebate, because, like, I know, obviously, we're also built on Fulu, and as I'm sure everybody else's code is, and there's a lot of changes in Gloss, so I think it's gonna be… you know, I'm wondering if it's worth doing interop based on Fulu when, you know, when we're together, or…

149
00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:42.370
Matthew Keil: Is there enough time to rebase both the spec, get it merged, and

150
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.770
Matthew Keil: And rebase all of our code.

151
00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:47.429
Matthew Keil: Just, just thinking out loud here.

152
00:29:49.290 --> 00:30:00.069
Justin Florentine (Besu): So that… remember that this is a cross-layer, feature, so whatever decision we make here is gonna apply to the ELs as well. I think ELs would…

153
00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:07.190
Justin Florentine (Besu): Well, speaking for Bayesu, EO would prefer to be on top of Glamsterdam, I think. Than Trulu.

154
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:24.129
Matthew Keil: And I think we do, too. I'm just wondering time, like, is if we don't… if we don't get clarity until, you know, sometime late… late February that it is headliner, in order to trigger the PR process, or the rebase in PR of…

155
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:36.829
Matthew Keil: of the spec on top of the Glamsterdam spec. That's not gonna leave a whole lot of time in order to rebase the code, with whatever changes that are necessary. So I think it's just worth something to think about.

156
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:44.450
Jihoon: Is it… Is it about the spec PR, or having…

157
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.900
Jihoon: Or working in PBS client. Good, yeah.

158
00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:56.699
Matthew Keil: Exactly. Like, we'd have to have a working EPBS client, and rebase all of the,

159
00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:00.450
Matthew Keil: all of the FOSL code on top of that.

160
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:12.490
Matthew Keil: And I'm just concerned that it's… because, like, they're not expecting EPBS DevNet Zero until… I'm guessing it's going to be March from what we just heard on our testing call, if not mid-March.

161
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:21.980
Matthew Keil: So it's gonna be… it's gonna be a tight timeline in order to be able to get everything, you know, all the pieces together for, you know, for us to actually have a meaningful…

162
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:23.540
Matthew Keil: Session together.

163
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:27.969
Jihoon: Yeah, that makes sense. I think…

164
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:40.689
Jihoon: On the CL side, we don't need to try to make the intro based on Fulu, but on the EL side, given that the changes we're gonna have on the EL

165
00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.399
Jihoon: on flu and on coloss are…

166
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:58.919
Jihoon: quite minimal. So, we were using one client, I believe it was Lowestar, to try interrupt between Rez and Aragon, just to make sure that it is working correctly.

167
00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:07.429
Jihoon: But that was just about the EL. So, in general, I don't think we need to make every client's interop working.

168
00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:11.840
Jihoon: Given that we are not gonna be based on blue anyway.

169
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:21.530
Jihoon: So, that's my thought. So, after we… have a working PBS client, it will be, like.

170
00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:25.939
Jihoon: I don't know, mid-March or April, then…

171
00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:35.629
Jihoon: given that there is… there will be a lot of changes, then some clients might prefer to just build everything from scratch, I'm not sure, it's up to their choice.

172
00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.959
Jihoon: So, but… We We don't need to rush, right?

173
00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:44.310
Jihoon: we are targeting next to Amsterdam, so…

174
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.269
Jihoon: I think we still have a lot of time to do, yeah.

175
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:56.270
Matthew Keil: Just wanted to put that thought in the world, only, you know, just because I know we're scheduling, so just get the… get the wheels turning, you know what I mean, mentally, so we can all think about it.

176
00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.450
Jihoon: Yeah, cool, yeah.

177
00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:09.199
Jihoon: I think in the meantime, if you were to use some developer resources,

178
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:16.780
Jihoon: you guys can give a review on the PR, just to make sure that if the PR makes sense or not.

179
00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.559
Jihoon: Alright, do we want to cover more questions?

180
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:43.259
Jihoon: Yes, Katya?

181
00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.320
Katya: Hello, everyone. Can you hear me?

182
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.780
Jihoon: Yep.

183
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:59.699
Katya: If you have some time, could you please make a short summary of your PR, so you shared it? Is it some tiny changes, or maybe something…

184
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:02.100
Katya: Some new logic, or…

185
00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:06.629
Jihoon: which PRR you're referring to?

186
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:11.949
Katya: The specs PR 804818.

187
00:34:13.270 --> 00:34:13.900
Katya: So…

188
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:16.870
Jihoon: Yeah, so, that's,

189
00:34:18.110 --> 00:34:22.489
Jihoon: I can give you a summary here. So, it's just about, like, a refactoring

190
00:34:22.739 --> 00:34:26.299
Jihoon: stuff we introduced in Glasp.

191
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:36.090
Jihoon: spec, So we, we did some refactor to process withdrawals function.

192
00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.650
Jihoon: And… Some parts of that are related to…

193
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.389
Jihoon: Part of the function that we are modifying.

194
00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:52.540
Jihoon: And… The second thing is… In the fork choice spec.

195
00:34:52.679 --> 00:35:01.670
Jihoon: although we are based on Fulu, there were… there was also some refactor to the existing fork choice function.

196
00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:09.000
Jihoon: And some were not exactly the same with full spec, so I changed it a little bit.

197
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.429
Jihoon: to make sure we are in line with Fulu's spec.

198
00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:20.049
Jihoon: And… That's it. So, nothing fundamentally different from what we had yesterday.

199
00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:25.980
Jihoon: But there are some refactors that we wanna… Commenting too.

200
00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:32.109
Katya: Yeah, I got it, thank you. Nothing, like, very serious. Okay, thanks.

201
00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.190
Jihoon: Cool, thanks.

202
00:35:48.570 --> 00:35:52.059
Jihoon: Do we have more questions? Otherwise, we can…

203
00:35:52.850 --> 00:35:54.720
Jihoon: Go ahead and wrap up the call.

204
00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:21.650
Jihoon: It seems we're good, so I think we can go ahead and wrap up this call early. We're gonna have a next breakout call in two weeks, so we can discuss anything there.

205
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.430
Jihoon: yeah, sorry about the asshole.

206
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:33.309
Jihoon: In the beginning of this call, we're gonna have a much smoother breakout call next time.

207
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:40.519
Jihoon: Thank you for joining this breakout call. Hope you guys have a great rest of your day, and…

208
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.189
Jihoon: See you in two weeks! Thank you!

209
00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:45.149
Katya: Thank you, bye.

210
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:46.100
Eitan: Thank you.

211
00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:46.790
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah.
