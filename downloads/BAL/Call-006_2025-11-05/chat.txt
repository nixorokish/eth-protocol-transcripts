00:06:14	Toni Wahrstaetter:	https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1787
00:08:54	Karim T.:	Gas used or number of read per transaction ?
00:09:03	Jared Wasinger:	Gas used
00:09:52	Karim T.:	Asking if it will be better to track the amount of read instead . Maybe not
00:11:23	Karim T.:	Maybe we need more tests and push that in another  fork
00:16:45	mirgee:	Doesn't optimizing execution result in practical benefit only if state root computation isn't the bottleneck anymore?
00:16:51	raxhvl:	If we wanted we could infer computational effort by just size of state access
00:18:15	Toni Wahrstaetter:	Replying to "If we wanted we coul..."

yeah this works better than gas limit. I analyzed that once
00:18:52	draganrakita:	Is this about fast failing on gas mismatch?
00:21:30	draganrakita:	Even gas is not reliable to say that Tx is going to take N amount of time to execute
00:22:39	draganrakita:	If tx uses N gas it does not mean it will take M ms, it can revert at the start and take M/100 ms to execute
00:24:01	Gary Rong:	but in this case it's a bonus for block execution? it's supposed to use m ms but it ends up with m/100 ms to complete N gas
00:24:14	Gary Rong:	We actually only care about the worst case
00:24:17	mirgee:	Doesn’t gas account for storage growth as well, not just execution time?
00:25:37	Stefan Starflinger:	https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/bal-devnet-0
00:25:53	draganrakita:	Replying to "We actually only car..."

True, just adding a comment about reliability of used gas
00:26:20	Karim T.:	Also last version of BAL tests are failing much more with the old forks
00:27:27	Jared Wasinger:	Get also doesn’t pass the old fork tests
00:27:35	Ishika:	Reacted to "Also last version ..." with ➕
00:27:36	Jared Wasinger:	*geth
00:29:15	mirgee:	I think there are some known issues with the tests which should be corrected in the next patch release?
00:29:28	Karim T.:	Because when I see the number of failing tests for each clients I will prefer to have more passing tests before https://hive.ethpandaops.io/#/group/bal
00:29:53	draganrakita:	I have list on test that fail on v1.4.0 here:

00:30:32	draganrakita:	Would assume all/most of them are test problems

00:34:58	Stefan Starflinger:	For testing can clients please run the evm-fuzz scenario of the spamoor in their kurtosis testnets
00:35:21	draganrakita:	I feel that revm is in good place regarding BAL. So if people want to run blockchain tests, they can install rust, clone revm repo (use rakita/bal branch), and run  cargo run -p revme — btest path_to_test . On BAL missmatch it should print out full BAL

00:39:27	felipe:	Printing the full bal is ideal thank you for that. How is this branch different from `bal-devnet-0`, where we're aligning that branch name for all clients?
00:40:06	Po:	Reacted to "I feel that revm is ..." with ❤️

Besu also has a debug endpoint to get a disagreeing block and the generated bal by besu. Useful for comparing. Added it to the above doc
00:42:35	draganrakita:	Replying to "I feel that revm is ..."

Here is example of output: https://gist.github.com/rakita/e1e2d0dd26d9ab878235ff2be5defa94
00:42:47	draganrakita:	Claude is amazing for this kind of work 😄
00:42:55	Po:	What's the random read throughput limit on this SSD?
00:43:13	felipe:	Reacted to "Here is example of..." with 🔥
00:48:16	Gary Rong:	For batch read over the raw SSD, the qps is 570218.58
00:51:01	Po:	okay,  seems the ssd's bandwidth is 2G/s. Say it we test it with FIO in 4k read size
00:51:35	draganrakita:	While we are talking about number of cores, we should have minimum spec number for it. Something like, recommending 4 cores, similar how ram and disk are recommended.

00:59:40	felipe:	I wanted to bring up debugging in this session. It would be very useful if we had the full bal in debug logs from all clients when there is a mismatch. In some cases we are only getting the hash mismatch which makes it difficult to track / compare test BALs vs the client BAL to see where the issue may be.
