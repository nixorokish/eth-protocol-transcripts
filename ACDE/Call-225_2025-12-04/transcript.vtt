1
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.380
Justin Florentine (Besu): Good morning, Fusaka!

2
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:02.910
Ansgar Dietrichs: Can you all hear me?

3
00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:05.860
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yes, we can.

4
00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, well, that's,

5
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:19.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I destroyed my laptop over DevConnect and still don't have one, so I'm on a loaner device, and the loan device decided to do a big macOS update overnight, so…

6
00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: It's all a bit, picky. Anyway,

7
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think… are we… would we be ready to go live?

8
00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:31.380
Josh Davis: Whenever you are.

9
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:44.439
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, and just one quick check, for the scoping part of the call, there would be a document again to screen share, if maybe someone else could do the screen sharing again, that would be…

10
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:50.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: Great, I'll… I'll post the link in Zoom chat once we get there. But yeah, then we can… we can go live.

11
00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:54.709
Josh Davis: Alright, you are alive.

12
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome.

13
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:05.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Welcome, everyone, to Okodev's 225, if I didn't miscount.

14
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:15.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: M… We have two main issues for today. One will be, Prisaka, looking back at the art fork.

15
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.830
Ansgar Dietrichs: First, of course, congratulations, everyone, to a overall very successful HardFog.

16
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:26.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then we'll get back into limestone scoping.

17
00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:36.240
Ansgar Dietrichs: For Fusaka, we have… A document with a quick summary of incidents that

18
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: happened around for Salcad. Do we have someone on the call to briefly present that?

19
00:07:53.570 --> 00:07:57.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Terrence, if you want to go first regarding the prison situation?

20
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:18.039
terence: Yeah, so over last night, about, like, let's see, 9 hours and 4 minutes ago, EPOC411440, the participation, or the target vote, dropped to 79%, so this is the recent issue that

21
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:28.930
terence: like, previously, as we know, to validate an attestation requires you to reconstruct the target state, right? And this is the state of the target checkpoint, advanced

22
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:39.960
terence: to the targeted park. And normally, this is very cheap, because of attestations share the same target. But attestations from the lagging node, the node that's catching up, or forks.

23
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:49.059
terence: can force client to regenerate the old state, and which is expensive, and this maybe does better on some client implementations.

24
00:08:49.060 --> 00:09:13.909
terence: So to basically avoid this, we added a heuristic in Capella, right? And then the heuristic stated as such that if the target epoch is the current epoch, we just use the head state. If the target epoch is older, then we will check if the target is basically a real checkpoint and generate if needed, right? But this introduced a subtotal bug in Fusaka, which we fixed earlier.

25
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:28.339
terence: that head state may not be compatible with the target state, right? And then, because of this fix, we added some refactor that we kind of widened the scope on what we consider

26
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:42.880
terence: a valid checkpoint, but we also added a future flag to essentially gate under that, right? And this kind of recreated the same issue we saw in the Capella outage that

27
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:56.310
terence: notes from receiving older attestations from the previous EPOC are generating state heavily, causing them to miss attestation duty. So the current phase recommendation is to add that feature of

28
00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:13.870
terence: use that feature flag, which we had in multiple posts and threads, and that will resolve the issue for now. And we're also working on a long-term fix, which we should have a release out, next week. And we also have a formal post-mortem to be released next week as well.

29
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:16.109
terence: Yeah, that's an update from us.

30
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good.

31
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.739
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any other comments, or anyone else, that wanted to talk about anything regarding the Prism?

32
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: Incident in particular?

33
00:10:55.970 --> 00:11:04.359
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise… there were… Very small other minor issues mentioned.

34
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: in, this incident document that, I think connects to also linked in chat.

35
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:17.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: is there anything, that we should address on the call here?

36
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:20.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: Or are these things we can deal with async?

37
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:48.890
Dustin: I guess I'll just mention, in terms of the Nimbus Nethermind one, and Nixo's link, this appears to be… as mentioned, it may be a build issue, it's… I would say this is not a…

38
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.400
Dustin: A productive or appropriate forum for that.

39
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.559
Dustin: It's not… it's not clear if it's another mite issue at all.

40
00:11:57.260 --> 00:11:58.870
Dustin: It's still being looked at.

41
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:06.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: That's good.

42
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:18.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and what does I see? You just joined, just in case you have anything specific you wanted to add as well, but yeah, we just got an update from Terrence already.

43
00:12:23.700 --> 00:12:32.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise, Barnabas, if you're on the call, could you give a just a quick update of the current, mainnet state?

44
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:33.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Are we looking?

45
00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:55.830
Stefan Starflinger: Barnabis can't talk right now, but I'm happy to kind of give an update that Fusaka went very well in the fork. It's just the prism issue was pretty much the only thing that happened for us in the middle of the night, but we had the Australians and the lab team working on trying to understand

46
00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:58.879
Stefan Starflinger: What's, what's going on with the attestations?

47
00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.810
Stefan Starflinger: And I think, Terrence already summed it up pretty well.

48
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.290
Stefan Starflinger: Otherwise, there's not much more from us.

49
00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:15.919
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and it looks like participation back to very healthy levels.

50
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, overall, of course, I think this was, again.

51
00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: Very quick and amazing responses by everyone involved.

52
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:28.379
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you all very much.

53
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:34.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, is there anything else regarding Tusaka, then, that we should address on this call?

54
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:54.279
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, Alex, did you prefer to mention BP01, just so people have it top of mind?

55
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:04.920
stokes: Yeah, yeah, really just… just mentioning the BP01s coming up, so it's in about a week,

56
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:10.880
stokes: There's not anything anyone needs to do, but it should raise up the, the bulk counts, so…

57
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:16.550
stokes: Super exciting, and more just something to have everyone… have on everyone's radar.

58
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: Good.

59
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:25.439
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, then…

60
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:43.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: For the next, agenda point, just… there's a few housekeeping items for today's call, and I split them into urgent and non-urgent, so that we talk about the urgent ones before going to glam system scoping, and then the other ones only if we have time. So for the, more brief time-sensitive ones.

61
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:58.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: first, all could have timings regarding future calls, not the one, coming up right after this one, in two weeks, but, but after that, both on the ACDC and ACDE side, there was questions around the holiday period, maybe to already briefly address.

62
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:07.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: In particular, Alex, and you mentioned possibly cancelling ACDC on December 25th, is that already locked in? Like, what's the status there?

63
00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.650
stokes: Yeah, I think we should.

64
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.579
stokes: It's a holiday.

65
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.140
stokes: Pretty much everywhere.

66
00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:20.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, okay.

67
00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:32.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, everyone be aware that we'll likely have… that we won't have an ACDC on December 25th. And then the question more relevant on our side here is for the week after, so that's January 1st.

68
00:15:32.430 --> 00:15:40.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: Obviously also a holiday in many places. The question is, what do we do there?

69
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:59.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: whether to keep or to cancel. Of course, on that ACDE side, we have a lot of continued scoping work, so the question is, is it worth keeping the ACDE on January 1st, or do we want to cancel it, or do we maybe try to, for example, see if we could borrow the ACDT on the week after or something?

70
00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: to replace ACD.

71
00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:04.380
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do people have?

72
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:10.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: it looks like in chat that January 1st, at least, people really want to cancel as well.

73
00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:25.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: So then I would say, unless people disagree, that we decide to cancel January 1st ACDE, but I'll look into potential replacement candidates to not just have that be

74
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: canceled without a replacement, and then on ACDE in two weeks, we can…

75
00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: Make potential decisions around a replacement.

76
00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:56.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, that's that housekeeping item. And then, the other one was, Fossil. Didn't really quite fit into Gramsadan, because it's actually more about specifically not being in Gramsadan, potentially, but in the hard work after, there was these continued discussions about the potential

77
00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:02.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: a need for a credible pre-commitment, to… to have fossil,

78
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:18.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: in HSTA, if we don't put it into Gromsadam, and whether there's any process, mechanism that could help with such a credible commitment. Alex, I think you had a topic you wanted to bring up from… from the ACDCs out there?

79
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:28.040
stokes: Sure, yeah. So, yeah, we've been talking about this on the CL side, for a couple weeks now, and…

80
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:41.189
stokes: Essentially, it wasn't clear how to move forward last call, and, like, one point that was made was to also get a temperature check from the EL. So, that's really all I wanted to do today.

81
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.530
stokes: We'll just try to understand…

82
00:17:47.120 --> 00:18:00.460
stokes: Yeah, how people are thinking about this over here. You know, should we try to scope this for HECA? Should we, you know, just think about the headliner process and how fossil there? How does it square with Clemsterdam? And all of the above?

83
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:14.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. And again, the idea is more temporary check than specific decisions. Do we have…

84
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.749
Ansgar Dietrichs: EL client devs with… Opinions on this topic.

85
00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.059
Ansgar Dietrichs: I see the Netherland team supports SFI in Fossil.

86
00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: a Facebook?

87
00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.820
soispoke: Yeah, I don't want to be, difficult, but…

88
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:46.670
soispoke: I mean, I think a legit question will be… How many temperature checks?

89
00:18:47.170 --> 00:18:49.830
soispoke: Do we need to have a bud force soon to…

90
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:54.540
soispoke: Move on and make progress at some point, because it… it does seem like we had…

91
00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.790
soispoke: A lot, of… temperature checks, and I do feel like they…

92
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:05.240
soispoke: Converge, into one direction quite often, so…

93
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:08.749
soispoke: I would love for us to be able to make progress at some point.

94
00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:33.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, that's a reasonable comment. I think from my side, I can only say that that's a little unfortunate, because this topic's obviously split between ACDC and ACDE, with more of the actual decision-making driven from the ACDC side, so that's why on ACDE, it always sounds like we're basically just asking for yet another round of input.

95
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, next one?

96
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:52.119
nixo: I'm just gonna… I'm gonna say, after the Glamsterdam headliner process, I think we created an expectation of a public process that people can participate in and predict and,

97
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.070
nixo: It would… it makes…

98
00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:02.610
nixo: ACD and, like, the government process feel a lot less messy, because people can understand what's going on, and I think that we should…

99
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:06.209
nixo: continue to do this headliner process, so I think…

100
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:15.620
nixo: in my head, the best path forward is CFI-only fossil right now, going through a headliner process, and then publishing this

101
00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.440
nixo: the headliner… process timeline.

102
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:25.280
nixo: for everybody to see and understand that we are choosing the HECA headliners,

103
00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.590
nixo: And then choose it at the end of that headliner proposal process.

104
00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.330
Ansgar Dietrichs: And tomorrow?

105
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:42.330
soispoke: Yeah, is there then a reason why we do these temperature checks? If it's sort of decided anyways that

106
00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:48.749
soispoke: The clients expressing opinions about wanting it included just don't…

107
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:56.029
soispoke: make a difference? I'm just wondering, like, why do we do these temperature checks if at the end, like.

108
00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:59.240
soispoke: I don't know, it feels like protocol coordination, or like…

109
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:07.250
soispoke: Other people just make calls about, yeah, you know what, there's gonna be a headliner process, and we're gonna do things a certain way.

110
00:21:07.420 --> 00:21:14.850
soispoke: If that's the case, it's fine, like, but then we should do the temperature checks and sort of, like, the…

111
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:24.690
soispoke: gather opinions and have the teams come together, at that point. Like, it feels like we are repeating the same process over and over and over.

112
00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:43.599
nixo: I agree with that. I… I agree that, like, taking temperature checks every call is… it seems un… seems messy and redundant and not productive. And the reason I see behind… behind having a headliner process is because the clients are…

113
00:21:43.810 --> 00:21:50.089
nixo: The people who come to these calls. And generally people… other people do not

114
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:53.909
nixo: Pay a lot of attention to these calls, and so…

115
00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:00.730
nixo: Having a published headliner process, especially after having set a precedent in Glamsterdam.

116
00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:06.630
nixo: Gives people an expectation that they know how to participate in this process.

117
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.430
Ansgar Dietrichs: Muck.

118
00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:31.209
Marc: I think my feeling here is that we're not really bypassing the headliner process necessarily, but since there's been, kind of, very clear, enthusiasm from the community for Fossil, you know, in Glamsterdam, it's more like we're just kind of shifting it to the next fork.

119
00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:42.510
Marc: And just on an implementation level, I think if it's SFI'd and we commit to it, then, like, personally, I'm working on fossils, so, you know, I can actually start working on that, whereas if it's…

120
00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.689
Marc: still CFI'd, and there's a lot of…

121
00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.630
Marc: you know, will it go in or not? Then it becomes kind of…

122
00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:50.430
Marc: We don't know where to allocate resources.

123
00:22:54.510 --> 00:23:11.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Before the next, people, just wanted to briefly mention, yeah, I understand the criticism around this continued temperature check ping pong, but I do think this will be a decision that we will ultimately make in one week, on the ACDC side, so obviously everyone who

124
00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:23.609
Ansgar Dietrichs: feels passionate about that should also be on that call, so we can hear a few more opinions, but I would try to, like, timebox it to not have too much of a back-and-forth debate on this call. Yeah.

125
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.989
Carl Beekhuizen: I think the important part of the…

126
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.150
Carl Beekhuizen: The headliner process and why we should go through this thing is that

127
00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:34.619
Carl Beekhuizen: Like, there's an opportunity cost to shipping?

128
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:42.700
Carl Beekhuizen: fossil here. I think most people here, or pretty much everyone here, wants some form of fossil. It's just like, is that…

129
00:23:42.990 --> 00:23:53.660
Carl Beekhuizen: like, better than shipping everything else, and I think that's why we should go through the headliner process. I imagine that we're just gonna end up back at Fossil, because that seems like what the overwhelming support is, but I think we need to be considering

130
00:23:53.920 --> 00:24:01.699
Carl Beekhuizen: what we are choosing to not ship by shipping fossil, and I think that's why it's very important we go through the full headliner process for this.

131
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:07.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Nico?

132
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:25.090
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah, my one comment that I wanted to make later on for the PQ precompiles, but it's the same here. We should definitely reflect that new process, if it is, like, enforced in the EIP1 and in the main EIP page.

133
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:34.790
Nicolas Consigny: Because as of now, like, if you're a new contributor to Ethereum, you go and you check EIP1, you go and you check, the EIP, Ethereum.org website.

134
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:45.329
Nicolas Consigny: And none of this, like, new process is specified, so, like, for the PQ precompiles that we will be discussing later, we have different, precompiles that we've been working on, and,

135
00:24:45.560 --> 00:25:02.199
Nicolas Consigny: like, some people showed up because they liked the EIPs and, like, proposed them for inclusion. These peoples are not the authors, and so we end up in a situation where, like, we are about to discuss precompice, but the authors didn't really ask for it.

136
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:21.389
Nicolas Consigny: So yeah, I think it's… it would be much clearer if we could just have this in one document. Currently, you have to follow forums, ACMDs, EIP1, then you have to find about the Meta EIP, and so it's an entire process that is quite long and quite difficult.

137
00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.160
Nicolas Consigny: And so, yeah, I think we did great with the new, forecast and the new…

138
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:32.970
Nicolas Consigny: the new tools that are surrounding ACD, but this part should definitely be reflected in EIP1.

139
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:46.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: That's good. Do we have any further comments from the EL side? Regarding…

140
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.450
Ansgar Dietrichs: The first narrowly the process here.

141
00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: Tamar?

142
00:25:52.110 --> 00:26:00.589
soispoke: Yeah, sorry, it's actually an actual question. Like you said, a decision will be actually made next to ACDC,

143
00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.279
soispoke: But I feel like…

144
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:14.359
soispoke: going through the normal headliner process is not that, so is there a way to clarify exactly, you know, if a decision will be made in the next ACDC, and what the decision will be?

145
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:26.199
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, I don't want to fully speak for Alex, so Alex, please feel free to correct me if this is wrong, but my understanding would be that on next ACDC, we just make a decision regarding the question of

146
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:36.449
Ansgar Dietrichs: what special treatment process-wise do we want to give fossil, with respect to H star? So, like, do we want to CFI it, SFI it, how would that relate to the

147
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:54.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: headline our process as it starts. Again, I think on the social layer, everyone already agreed that we all are pre-committed to having it in the next hardbook either way, but again, the decision of, like, how does it exactly kind of relate to the process?

148
00:26:54.550 --> 00:26:57.699
Ansgar Dietrichs: for H-star, that would be the decision that I would expect for next week.

149
00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.059
stokes: Yeah, I mean, basically just how to handle it.

150
00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:23.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, I also agree with people in chat that have the need to timebox this topic here, so I would say that unless there's any urgent other comments on this, then I would

151
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:34.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: end that section here for now. And then we can actually move on to… Lamsterdam. And,

152
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:47.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so for… for continued stem cell scoping, I went through the… both the individual client preference docs, and then also specifically just, like.

153
00:27:47.490 --> 00:28:03.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: all the discussion we had on last ACDE, which was 4 weeks ago, and assembled… like, a document 8, I just find that more useful than the meta EIP document, because it separates out the 40 EIPs into different categories.

154
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:21.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then also with some annotations, around, potential CFI, DFI candidates. This is not a formal kind of status, process-wise, the candidate is just an annotation of, like, this seems to have either very strong support, or this has had a lot of skepticism.

155
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:29.189
Ansgar Dietrichs: So the idea would be, before we go and discuss all the EIPs that are not yet on either side of that, that we start by maybe the ED.

156
00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:38.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: potentially easy decisions. I do apologize, I only published this very, very last minute before the call.

157
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:44.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: which was not a proper process, I should have… should have published this much earlier.

158
00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:48.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: But if we… do we have someone that could, share their screen and…

159
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: Have the document open.

160
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.190
Josh Davis: Yeah, if you post it, I'll share it.

161
00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:57.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep.

162
00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:00.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: That's… I put it in chat.

163
00:29:08.370 --> 00:29:12.169
Josh Davis: Cool, just give me a second to configure the things with the strain as well.

164
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, boys.

165
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.590
Pooja Ranjan: Josh, would it be helpful if I share my screen and you continue with streaming?

166
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:39.650
Josh Davis: Yeah, no, I think I've got it here. Maybe for next time, though.

167
00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:54.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, thank you, and my apologies for ambushing you live on the call with this.

168
00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:13.339
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect. So, the idea is that, if you can scroll down a little bit, they are in yellow, these marked, yeah, exactly. So, basically, the first few sections, we'll get to this a little bit later, but they don't have yet clear CFI DFI candidates. The first section that does have them is the

169
00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:20.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: general, repricings. And the idea here is not that, again, for each one to just highlight.

170
00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:25.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: Why… why it is marked this way, and then if there's maybe anything…

171
00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:44.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so basically, like, if we just go on the list to start, specifically the block accounting without refunds seem to be actually one of the most clear candidates for inclusion of all, seemed to have universal support, so I was just curious, do people feel ready today to make a CFI decision on

172
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:49.939
Ansgar Dietrichs: EAP7778, the… Block gas limit accounting without refunds.

173
00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: And I'm not sure if I want to…

174
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:13.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: for every single client on each topic. Maybe for the CFI candidates, is there anyone that would object, any client that would object to a CFI decision here?

175
00:31:17.970 --> 00:31:30.059
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise… then I would say… 47778, we make a CFI decision now, and it's… In the hot book.

176
00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay,

177
00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:50.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: you can see some of them have a question mark. The question mark is just, if there's still any unresolved issues that might preclude a full decision on today's call, but they are a strong candidate, so 7971 overall, that's the, the, global cut for T-Store.

178
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:54.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: That had, some concerns around

179
00:31:54.370 --> 00:31:59.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: the kind of abstraction compatibility. Otherwise, people really liked it.

180
00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:07.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is there an update on the… Account abstraction concerns, do we feel ready to…

181
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: Make an inclusion decision, or does this require help?

182
00:32:11.450 --> 00:32:12.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: One more round off.

183
00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Iteration to resolve these issues.

184
00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:42.019
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sorry, that's… yeah, I should be a bit clearer about this. There's EIP7971, the hard limit for transient storage.

185
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:53.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: if there are no concrete, opinions, then I would…

186
00:32:53.160 --> 00:33:02.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: for now, basically postpone the decision, because, again, it still has one unresolved issue, which I would say would preclude CFI.

187
00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:22.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: Also, Justin, I see in chat the question, how many ERPs are we planning to CFI? Basically, I would, for now, just do individual one-off decisions. I would expect that going through this list, we will not end up with more than a small handful of decisions.

188
00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:29.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then afterwards, maybe have a… take a step back and… See where we're at, or…

189
00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:35.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I'd be happy, happy to have comments on alternative process, if that doesn't make sense.

190
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:50.710
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, let me just clarify why I'm asking. So, like, I have the Bayeswood Team's tier list up in front of me, and I'm looking at that, and so if you say, okay, this one, should it be CFI'd, and I see it as maybe in the A tier, but not the S tier.

191
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.899
Justin Florentine (Besu): Should I agree with the CFI situation or not?

192
00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:09.639
Justin Florentine (Besu): this is what I'm… I'm trying to… I'm trying to figure out, like, how many of these CFI quote-unquote votes do I need to apportion, because I would like to save them all from my S tier,

193
00:34:10.199 --> 00:34:14.620
Justin Florentine (Besu): selections. I'm just trying to kind of square how this is gonna work.

194
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:20.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right.

195
00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:32.319
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Barnabas in chat saying that we should not maybe have a strict number limit.

196
00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:47.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: I can… if we… if we… so basically, like, in the… in the document, I have, I think, 4 clear CFI candidates that I saw, and 5 with a question mark that maybe had something still to be resolved, so that's already 9 ERPs.

197
00:34:47.949 --> 00:34:54.779
Ansgar Dietrichs: Most of them are, though, like, very, very small, like the SWATNAM opcode, that should be pretty self-contained.

198
00:34:56.379 --> 00:35:07.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: then the main, other sources of potential APs that, did not… were not on that list yet were specifically around repricing, just because there were unresolved issues.

199
00:35:08.119 --> 00:35:19.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: and, possibly around contract size. So that, I think, maybe is overall… The kind of the,

200
00:35:19.689 --> 00:35:26.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: the sources of likely, ERPs, so… but yeah, I don't know. I personally would just continue on with the list for now.

201
00:35:27.419 --> 00:35:29.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I'm also, you know.

202
00:35:29.629 --> 00:35:37.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: leading the scoping process for the first time, so I'm just going with what feels reasonable to me, and I'm happy to correct costs.

203
00:35:42.679 --> 00:36:02.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I… in the interest of time, I would, for now, just move on with the idea here. So, like, I would say with… for the highlighted EIP currently, 7971, I would say, given that there was last time unresolved account protection, concerns, that we are, for now, postponing a decision, and,

204
00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:08.909
Ansgar Dietrichs: refer that back to the EIP champion to address these concerns, until the next call.

205
00:36:09.489 --> 00:36:22.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then we have on the list a DFI candidate that is EIP8011, the multidimensional gas metering, that can be highlighted.

206
00:36:22.209 --> 00:36:26.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: They are specifically, DFI…

207
00:36:26.639 --> 00:36:36.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: Because, kind of, people's clients overall felt that it was overly complex for now, and, premature, and probably better fit for future hard work.

208
00:36:36.249 --> 00:36:41.839
Ansgar Dietrichs: Are there comments on this? Do we feel ready to make that DFI decision?

209
00:37:02.269 --> 00:37:14.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: And in particular, there was one, comment, I think, by Anders, pointing out that for specifically just state growth, like, basically once we'll talk about the,

210
00:37:14.899 --> 00:37:31.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: the repricing solution to state growth, it could be that we would want some very lightweight, kind of, minimum version of multidimensional metering if we want to consider an alternative approach today to the currently selected EAP, or proposed EAP, but I would still say that that should be separate, not

211
00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:42.899
Ansgar Dietrichs: And not… not just reusing AD11, so I personally would post that we just make a DFI decision now,

212
00:37:43.699 --> 00:37:46.939
Ansgar Dietrichs: And… Yeah.

213
00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:52.629
Ansgar Dietrichs: So basically, is there any client opposed to DFI-ing 8011?

214
00:37:58.979 --> 00:38:12.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: I did talk with Maria, because there's a question that she has a champion on the call today, and she's okay with AT11 not in Amsterdam, so then I would say Precision AT11DFI.

215
00:38:14.889 --> 00:38:21.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes. And then, Tony, by the way, just to address your comment, the idea is, again, process-wise, we first go through the

216
00:38:21.569 --> 00:38:31.149
Ansgar Dietrichs: CFI DFI candidates, because that's hopefully easy wins, and then go through all the sections that, are still… have more open questions.

217
00:38:31.459 --> 00:38:38.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: So the next, next one on the list is the, the one right under, under this, AT32,

218
00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:47.799
Ansgar Dietrichs: size-based storage gas pricing. So, clients generally spoke in favor of this one on the call.

219
00:38:47.839 --> 00:39:03.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: the reason I still put a question mark there is just that there was an ERP that does make pretty significant changes and came relatively late in the process, so I just wanted to check with people how much they've looked into the details here, how

220
00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:08.739
Ansgar Dietrichs: comfortable there with the majority of the IP, and if we are ready to make the CFI decision.

221
00:39:10.409 --> 00:39:14.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: So that's 8032 size-based storage gas pricing.

222
00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:25.639
Łukasz Rozmej: Is this the one with relatively complex migration?

223
00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:36.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: My understanding is that there is a migration step, 8.

224
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:43.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: I don't… I'm not sure if it's complex or not. Do we have, anyone on the call that has looked into this?

225
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:52.349
draganrakita: I think you will need to know the size of the current storages per contract, so you need to extract that information from somewhere.

226
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.930
draganrakita: I think that's the migration.

227
00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.110
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, but… I think this is…

228
00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:06.300
Łukasz Rozmej: hand-waving on the quite big concern over the CAP.

229
00:40:08.410 --> 00:40:13.750
draganrakita: Yeah, same, in my opinion, AIP seems complex to do.

230
00:40:14.610 --> 00:40:16.900
draganrakita: And I would rather skip it.

231
00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:27.869
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, unless we have a very good idea how to… how to do that, I'm also not sold on…

232
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:32.009
Łukasz Rozmej: Well, CFI is considered, so…

233
00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.600
Łukasz Rozmej: We can consider it, but I have reservations.

234
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:44.010
draganrakita: Additionally, it clashes a little bit with state creation, gas cost increase, AP8037.

235
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:57.429
draganrakita: we… if we include the state creation gas increase, then this ARP becomes, less relevant, because we already, like, increasing the gas by n times.

236
00:40:59.850 --> 00:41:00.810
draganrakita: So, yeah.

237
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:07.369
draganrakita: Maybe DFI, but… Consider it later is… it looks fine.

238
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:12.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, then, given that there are questions,

239
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:25.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: I would, for now, by the way, just to, you know, just so this all doesn't seem completely arbitrary, like, so one of the reasons that this… I put this on the list is, for example, that Nethermind had listed this as

240
00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.670
Ansgar Dietrichs: as an A as well, so,

241
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:42.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: yeah, Lukash, just so you don't feel like I'm trying to just push… push EFPs on people. But then I would postpone the decision on this one for extra two weeks, and I do see in the comment the question of, can't we just immediately DFI everything that

242
00:41:42.870 --> 00:41:56.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: that does have questions, I would say I would at least not do that with the ones that overall had pretty strong support. So, for example, this one had 3 A's by clients, only Aragon, from the ones that… from the teams that commented on it.

243
00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:59.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: had it listed as D.

244
00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:14.330
Ansgar Dietrichs: So for an ERP like that, I would just wait for 2 weeks to… to give people more time to look into them, and yes, but… but anything that's already more often on the DFI kind of side, and then if there's questions, I would just default to DFI.

245
00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:23.880
Łukasz Rozmej: So, our opinion on that was that we like the AP, like, idea, but the transition process sounds,

246
00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.359
Łukasz Rozmej: Impractical at what the current is, and…

247
00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:32.139
Łukasz Rozmej: Someone might convince me I'm wrong, but… But that's… that's the case.

248
00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:42.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, sounds good. So the point here is someone needs to convince, Lukash and other people that, like, from the rest team as well, there seem to be concerns about the transition, so…

249
00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.889
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, this one.

250
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: No decision today.

251
00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:54.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then we can move to the, last three in this section, so the next one is…

252
00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:59.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: AT53, this is the high precision through milligars.

253
00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: Overall, there's two ERPs here that, both are about,

254
00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:19.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: head precision, it's this one, and then the last one in the section, AD59, both of those overall head client comments that while higher precision for, popcodes is useful, it's just not worth

255
00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:27.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: having an EFP in Amsterdam, so I would propose DFI. Is there anyone that really wants to save either of those two?

256
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:29.460
Ansgar Dietrichs: Earpiece.

257
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:44.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise, okay, I would say we lock in the DFI for those two. So that's, that's 8053 and 8059.

258
00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:47.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: both of those EFI.

259
00:43:48.620 --> 00:44:07.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, and then the one in the section that we didn't yet get to is the second-to-last EIP8057. That is Interblock temporal locality gas discount. That was the strongest candidate already from last call to make a DFI decision, even though we had said no decisions on that call yet.

260
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:11.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: Just because it seems like clients really had to… were…

261
00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:17.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: Pretty convinced that that was not a good idea, so… unless everyone changed their minds, I would…

262
00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:21.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Assume that that's… PFI by default.

263
00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:31.999
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, I assume this call, at least this section, will just be me, a lot of me talking, but at least we are coming out of it with a bunch of decisions, so maybe bear with me.

264
00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:45.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then, yeah, we have basically, like, so the two that are delayed are the ones that have the question marks, those we will revisit in two weeks, and then the other ones actually follow the Canada recommendations, so that's…

265
00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:48.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Good to see.

266
00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then can we scroll to the next section?

267
00:44:53.840 --> 00:45:00.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. So, on… contract,

268
00:45:00.910 --> 00:45:07.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Besides, there was one ERP that did have relatively strong support, which is EAP7903,

269
00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:14.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: the removal of the init code size limit. The reason that that had a question mark is…

270
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: That there was one client, let me, let me check.

271
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:25.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Beso specifically had listed that as C tier.

272
00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:36.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: So I wanted to check, how people overall, specifically Basel, but also other clients, feel about it, because it did not specifically… it wasn't specifically discussed on last call.

273
00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: how realistic is this SSCFI candidate?

274
00:45:48.100 --> 00:46:04.080
Łukasz Rozmej: So… I think, never mind… Comments where that we are put… Potentially… unsure about the… Drum test analysis?

275
00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:09.289
Łukasz Rozmej: But we would like to see some numbers. I think it might be, like.

276
00:46:10.170 --> 00:46:16.659
Łukasz Rozmej: We might be overly cautious here about it, but yes, having some numbers would be good.

277
00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:23.759
Łukasz Rozmej: So, I think CFI is fine, but again, before, like, scheduled, we would like to see some numbers.

278
00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:37.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, but given the limited scoping Ramson, I would personally, for now, only make CFI decisions when they are clear that there's pretty universal support, so…

279
00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then it seems like… We might not be there.

280
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:54.950
draganrakita: I would say that the impact analysis is kind of… we're not sure what…

281
00:46:55.310 --> 00:46:57.499
draganrakita: What would happen if we remove that?

282
00:46:57.630 --> 00:47:02.010
draganrakita: So it's, like… It's better to stay, in my opinion.

283
00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:13.950
draganrakita: We can always remove it. The gas calculation is already covering the jump desk analysis, but it's kinda… the limit is there for

284
00:47:14.690 --> 00:47:20.220
draganrakita: Little bit more protection on the… Maybe some educators.

285
00:47:22.890 --> 00:47:34.550
Luis Pinto | Besu: I… I wonder what's the benefit of that without increasing the contract size limit, which we obviously cannot do without the chunk-based code, VIP.

286
00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:41.990
Luis Pinto | Besu: So if there's… what would be the added benefit? If there is none either, where would just TFI?

287
00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:46.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Greg?

288
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:52.020
Greg K | Lido: Yeah, I also have the same question, and I also posited that I think that…

289
00:47:52.240 --> 00:48:02.420
Greg K | Lido: Yeah, perhaps someone else should verify, but I think that 7903 is kind of contradicted with 7907, which…

290
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:22.499
Greg K | Lido: increases the unit code size, but does not… the maximum size, but does not make it kind of infinite. So, I think that 7903 removes the limit completely, but 7907, what this does is, like, it increases the current limit, and also increases the contract size limit.

291
00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:26.339
Greg K | Lido: So, among those VIPs, I think…

292
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:32.220
Greg K | Lido: Like, it's the same direction, but only one could be the final spare. You cannot have, for example, both…

293
00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:35.750
Greg K | Lido: 7903 and 7907.

294
00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:42.960
Greg K | Lido: So I think that these, like, discussion should be, like, Kind of together, right?

295
00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.470
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so yeah.

296
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:46.280
Greg K | Lido: Sometimes, but just, yeah.

297
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:47.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: No, it,

298
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:52.680
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, thank you. Then I think it's pretty clear we at least will definitely not make a CFI decision here.

299
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:59.459
Ansgar Dietrichs: We will revisit it once when we talk about the general contract size, but it sounds even more that weird.

300
00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:06.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: leading towards not inclusion here. Okay, then we have, two more in the utility section.

301
00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:16.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: one of them is 7668, removal of, bloom filters.

302
00:49:19.650 --> 00:49:31.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, this one, I wasn't sure whether to put a question mark. It seemed pretty universal support, but we also didn't hear many comments on the… on it on last call, so I would want to hear more active

303
00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:36.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: support for this before actually making the CFI decision, so…

304
00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does… do people have strong opinions on the removal of bloom filters?

305
00:49:58.110 --> 00:49:58.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: Huh?

306
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.659
Carl Beekhuizen: I think this is one of the features where

307
00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:17.089
Carl Beekhuizen: it doesn't really provide much benefit for anyone, and I think, like, most people agree that it should be removed, the question is, like, how does it fit in with the rest of the fork? So, if we have

308
00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:25.380
Carl Beekhuizen: a fork that's rather empty, and we have the capacity for it, then I think we should consider it, but I think we should, like, defer this decision until we know

309
00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:27.559
Carl Beekhuizen: What else we are trying to put in this fork?

310
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:32.039
Carl Beekhuizen: Because I think they're much higher priorities on this list.

311
00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:40.680
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. That seems very reasonable, actually, especially because, again, this one just did not have that many comments yet on last call, so then…

312
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:49.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: that's… postpone the decision. He might still be a candidate, but more as a filler beats on.

313
00:50:51.820 --> 00:51:06.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: also matches the comments in chat. Then we have, one more. That one seemed, actually, to have quite enthusiastic support, last time. There was 7708 ETH transfers emitting a lock, and I think we also had a specific extra

314
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:12.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: comment and support, in the agenda GitHub issue.

315
00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:16.450
Ansgar Dietrichs: How do we, like…

316
00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:24.140
Ansgar Dietrichs: have… has anyone basically soured on the CRP over the last two weeks? Is this… is this something that,

317
00:51:24.710 --> 00:51:26.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: That we are ready to CFI or not.

318
00:51:31.560 --> 00:51:38.519
Łukasz Rozmej: Again, here, I would love to see some numbers, like, what's the biggest receipt?

319
00:51:39.340 --> 00:51:50.500
Łukasz Rozmej: After that, because then, especially if we decrease the cost of the transfers, the simple transactions, Then…

320
00:51:50.610 --> 00:51:58.510
Łukasz Rozmej: What kind of receipts are we getting, right? That's a very good question, my opinion.

321
00:52:00.350 --> 00:52:03.399
Łukasz Rozmej: And I haven't seen any numbers.

322
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:12.329
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, so… we don't have any numbers here. Part of this is because…

323
00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:19.310
Carl Beekhuizen: Whatever this… whatever we do here, we will have to update the pricing of…

324
00:52:19.630 --> 00:52:24.810
Carl Beekhuizen: this part of an ETH transfer to account for the new logs.

325
00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:32.839
Carl Beekhuizen: Which we'll only know once we have more of the harmonization stuff, so, like, this ties into a lot of the repricing things, which we already decided we'd like to ship.

326
00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:36.559
Carl Beekhuizen: So, I think we just need to assume that this will…

327
00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:42.319
Carl Beekhuizen: like, be harmonized with everything else. The total amount of work that's required to be done here is very small, so…

328
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.269
Carl Beekhuizen: like, by node, so I think that…

329
00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:49.409
Carl Beekhuizen: Like, from that perspective, there's not too much to worry about.

330
00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:58.259
Carl Beekhuizen: Like, this to me is just, like, this one weird edge case where ETH is, like, just much worse than pretty much every other asset for people trying to interface with the chain.

331
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.639
Carl Beekhuizen: And I think this is, like, a great way of

332
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:05.350
Carl Beekhuizen: like, reducing the delta between ETH and all other assets on-chain.

333
00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:16.069
Łukasz Rozmej: One comment I also heard, I'm not sure about it, that because this is not from Genesis, it's less valuable, just adding at this moment than…

334
00:53:16.690 --> 00:53:24.929
Łukasz Rozmej: But it's not really that valuable. But… because you still need the old way somewhere in… in indexers, etc. Well…

335
00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.710
Carl Beekhuizen: I mean, yes and no, it's like…

336
00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:48.370
Carl Beekhuizen: if this is the only data you consider, then yes, but it means running an indexer, like, forward, like, henceforth, you would be able to just be able to look at what comes in via these logs, and make deltas. There's a one-time calculation you need to do for all the stuff in history. I don't think it's worth us making

337
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:52.720
Carl Beekhuizen: clients implement this records compatible, like, like.

338
00:53:52.890 --> 00:54:09.060
Carl Beekhuizen: putting this back towards Genesis, because I think that's just a lot of extra work, and I think for very little benefit, but I think we still get most of the benefits without it, but your point is definitely valid, that it is a little… like, you can't just look at all the logs since Genesis and know the values of everything.

339
00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.209
Carl Beekhuizen: But I think this is more about knowing about, like, new deposits and transfers and that kind of thing.

340
00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:29.600
Zsolt Felföldi: Yeah, may I just quickly interject here? So, so I believe that, this could be very valuable, so right now, right now, it's, like, extremely hard to use logs anyway, so,

341
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:41.789
Zsolt Felföldi: if we, at some point, not sure if we glamster demo or not, but we do 7745 at the log index, then it's totally possible to just, like.

342
00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:53.280
Zsolt Felföldi: I mean, create the new logs, the transactional logs, eTransfer logs from the fork, and also create the log index from the fork, but then just re-troactively re-index

343
00:54:53.280 --> 00:55:06.380
Zsolt Felföldi: or the pre-fork chain history with the, eTransfer, new eTransfer logs for the, like, the old history in, like, the new index. So, yeah, I think,

344
00:55:06.410 --> 00:55:14.620
Zsolt Felföldi: at least the way I hope, there is going to be some kind of log re-indexing anyway, so I think it's still very useful.

345
00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:27.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, so… Yeah, so there seems to be some remaining considerations around 7708.

346
00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:38.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do we make a decision today? On it, or… Do people want to… Look into those.

347
00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:46.899
Ansgar Dietrichs: And keep in mind, I think usually saying keep… look into those. In two weeks, we probably will not have more information than we have today.

348
00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:54.859
draganrakita: From Redside Sims, we… I think we support it and want to include it.

349
00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:58.820
draganrakita: It makes sense to have logs for the transfers.

350
00:55:58.930 --> 00:56:01.310
draganrakita: At least it is in the right direction.

351
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:13.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. And given, like, every… every client had it in S or A tier?

352
00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:16.509
Ansgar Dietrichs: So that's why I put it as TFI Canada.

353
00:56:19.690 --> 00:56:21.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: In the, interest of…

354
00:56:21.690 --> 00:56:32.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: making decisions, given that, overall, I would propose that we do CFI it, just given that there's overall, like, I see several messages in chat arguing for CFI status.

355
00:56:33.080 --> 00:56:36.330
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does anyone object to certifying it?

356
00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:49.110
Łukasz Rozmej: Well, the only downside is we are making EDA transfers, more pricey.

357
00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:53.689
Łukasz Rozmej: Because we write more to history.

358
00:56:54.050 --> 00:56:58.339
Zsolt Felföldi: Well, we do want this information, I mean, like…

359
00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:02.129
Zsolt Felföldi: this is a work we should do, actually, so yeah, I think…

360
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:09.440
draganrakita: There's a HEP in the core group that reduces entrusty gas for transaction.

361
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:15.379
draganrakita: So those two should be, like, considered one another.

362
00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:32.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so, as, as was already… as was said, yes, if we make an inclusion decision, then that means that any other EIP that touches the pricing of transfers will take this into account, and will basically, like, be marginally.

363
00:57:32.370 --> 00:57:44.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: more increased, Lukash, then my question is, would you be okay with CFI-ing it now? And then if, during the process, basically, like, we see that the numbers seem…

364
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:48.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: More punishing than, than, than thought, that we, that we just.

365
00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:48.900
Łukasz Rozmej: Yes, yes.

366
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:49.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: Not concluding it.

367
00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:51.359
Łukasz Rozmej: Please see if I…

368
00:57:51.670 --> 00:57:54.019
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then, CFI decision on this one.

369
00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:58.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then we can move to the next section, the, opcodes.

370
00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:03.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, first, a DFI candidate, 7791.

371
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:07.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: gas to ETH, there was some…

372
00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:14.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: concerns around implications, that overall implications are just not… not well enough understood. It's…

373
00:58:15.330 --> 00:58:23.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: pretty big paradigm change to the EVM was proposed relatively late, so for that reason, it seemed…

374
00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:28.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: likely to DFI? Is anyone… does anyone want to argue against DFI?

375
00:58:35.620 --> 00:58:39.150
Ansgar Dietrichs: And I would say B, deify it.

376
00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:50.979
Ansgar Dietrichs: The next one, 7819, set delegate, the reason that's…

377
00:58:51.170 --> 00:59:01.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: on the DFI candidate list, we did not… it did not come up on the last call, but all clients that have expressed an opinion on it have put it into C or D tier.

378
00:59:03.310 --> 00:59:11.140
Ansgar Dietrichs: That just seems to indicate it doesn't really have a chance for that, folks, so… unless anyone objects, again, DFI decision.

379
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:13.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

380
00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:22.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: DFI. And then we have one, I mentioned briefly earlier, 7843 slot num op code.

381
00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:32.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: steamed… For a potential candidate, it only is a question mark, because,

382
00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:39.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: some clients will only put it into B tier. Geth was arguing for it on the last call. Yeah, I just want to check.

383
00:59:40.650 --> 00:59:46.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: whether there's interest in CFI-ing it now, or whether this is more a filler EIP to decide at a later point.

384
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:55.239
Łukasz Rozmej: I think if we are… want to decrease, potentially, slot times in the near future,

385
00:59:55.770 --> 01:00:02.419
Łukasz Rozmej: Pushing this in earlier would help to potentially develop some kind of,

386
01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:05.049
Łukasz Rozmej: Ways of dealing with that later.

387
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.050
Łukasz Rozmej: on the EVM side.

388
01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:27.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Okay, then I would say we see a fire, is there any objection?

389
01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:34.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then… CFI decision on this one.

390
01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:39.999
Ansgar Dietrichs: And next one, EIP7979.

391
01:00:40.260 --> 01:00:43.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: call and return opcodes for the EVM.

392
01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:48.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: That one… Seemed to…

393
01:00:50.310 --> 01:00:58.689
Ansgar Dietrichs: overall have no client support. Aragon was speaking out against it, but Nethermine specifically had expressed

394
01:00:59.010 --> 01:01:03.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: interest in it, so I just wanted to double-check with, Netherland, yeah.

395
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.679
Łukasz Rozmej: Just one argument for it, because there are,

396
01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:13.970
Łukasz Rozmej: talks about potentially changing EVM to RISC-V, for example.

397
01:01:14.210 --> 01:01:27.130
Łukasz Rozmej: Which… I'm totally not convinced. I think EVM has a benefit of being more domain-specific, and I think

398
01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:31.600
Łukasz Rozmej: going to RISC-V might not be that good.

399
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:38.839
Łukasz Rozmej: But if we moved the EVM bytecode to this kind of call return opcodes.

400
01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:53.730
Łukasz Rozmej: We could relatively easy transpile, compile, whatever we want to call it, JIT, whatever we want to call it, EVM bytecode to basically any other form. We could go to RISC-V, we could go to native x86, we could go to ARM,

401
01:01:53.730 --> 01:02:00.870
Łukasz Rozmej: This unlocks potential optimizations of the… Of doing that.

402
01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:15.080
Łukasz Rozmej: While keeping the whole, base language under our control, so… That's a big, big upside,

403
01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.700
Łukasz Rozmej: I think it's also…

404
01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:25.849
Łukasz Rozmej: I have to agree that it's probably mostly… could be ported from EOF, so it's not… that much work.

405
01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:31.360
Łukasz Rozmej: On the… probably, maybe even on the testing side, I'm not sure about tests.

406
01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:47.059
Łukasz Rozmej: So those are, like, the four… four things. I'm not sure if it should go to Glamsterdam, but in general… so, sorry, to Glamsterdam. To… yeah, Glamsterdam, Glamsterdam. Okay, I'm confusing the forks now, too many forks. But,

407
01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:55.730
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, but I generally see this as an alternative path to different ESA, like Riskli.

408
01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:02.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, and given that,

409
01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:13.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: all clients, except for NetherMind, had expressed skepticism on this one. Do you… would NetherMind be okay with us just deciding now to wait at least until H-star with this?

410
01:03:13.590 --> 01:03:26.379
Łukasz Rozmej: Yes, yes, like I said, it's… we don't consider this as a super urgent, I just see a value of this path compared to the other one, and, it needs probably…

411
01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.640
Łukasz Rozmej: deeper discussions.

412
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:33.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then I would just… Proposed to DFI it?

413
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:34.959
Ansgar Dietrichs: 12% was another.

414
01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:39.070
Greg Colvin: I had something to say about that.

415
01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:42.250
Greg Colvin: Put it on the agenda 3 weeks ago.

416
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes, if you want to.

417
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Talk about that comment.

418
01:03:48.590 --> 01:04:02.419
Greg Colvin: What would you… what was just said pretty much covers the technical reasons to put it in. The reasons… I would prefer to see if I, to some extent, are personal.

419
01:04:02.530 --> 01:04:17.070
Greg Colvin: I'm 71 years old. Every time we delay this, I'm getting older, and the evidence is, that, it will get delayed.

420
01:04:17.540 --> 01:04:19.500
Greg Colvin: And…

421
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:29.350
Greg Colvin: At this point, at least 3 times, we have gotten, proposals to fix this problem, as close to

422
01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:42.840
Greg Colvin: In the code, and going into the upgrade, and then removed. So, I would much prefer to start to get this in sooner, so I can get to work. I want to

423
01:04:42.900 --> 01:04:51.269
Greg Colvin: what I want to do, and so the community trying to do static analysis can do what they need to do.

424
01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:58.370
Greg Colvin: Because they… they will not even start to look at this until it's actually on the main chain.

425
01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:00.050
Greg Colvin: And,

426
01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:10.530
Greg Colvin: So, I'd like to at least consider it, just even to consider it now, and get that conversation going.

427
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:22.649
Greg Colvin: Rather than… than kick it down the line, because I can't… I cannot predict that even 6 months from now, I'll be in a position to champion this.

428
01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:29.170
Greg Colvin: I don't know that there's any champions left.

429
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:37.969
Greg Colvin: For this work, and it is such a small change, and that it is such an industry standard,

430
01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:44.949
Greg Colvin: such an industry standard operation, there's just no reason it should not be an EVM.

431
01:05:47.530 --> 01:05:48.450
Greg Colvin: That's it, that's all.

432
01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:49.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right.

433
01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:56.149
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you, Greg. And just, yeah, as a personal note, I do… I do agree that there has been… I've been some of these

434
01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:08.919
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just that they've been so… have been very close to inclusion, at the edge of inclusion for a long time, that is personal… from a personal side, of course, for champions, very frustrating. So, I definitely understand that, Lukash?

435
01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:28.079
Łukasz Rozmej: If I can say one more thing, because there's a question of the legacy bytecode. So, we tried to create ILEVM, which would do exactly that, transpire the legacy bytecode to native x86. It is possible, but due to…

436
01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:39.989
Łukasz Rozmej: the size of the bytecode, that is basically one big method, right? One big function. No… no compiler later was put

437
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:45.170
Łukasz Rozmej: even try to optimize it. So, basically,

438
01:06:45.610 --> 01:06:59.399
Łukasz Rozmej: That's the problem, so we can still support the old bytecode with the translation, but for example, we can price it out that it won't be practical for much use in the future.

439
01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:08.649
Łukasz Rozmej: So, we do have kind of a backward-compatible way of going through things, but we would have to

440
01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:14.450
Łukasz Rozmej: Support some kind of transition of most things to the new format.

441
01:07:16.010 --> 01:07:29.509
Greg Colvin: The EIP discusses that some, and these are the kinds of things to discuss as we consider the EIP. I'm really almost begging

442
01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:36.910
Greg Colvin: Let's consider it now. Let's not say maybe we will consider it much later.

443
01:07:39.590 --> 01:07:40.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: So…

444
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:52.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: just in terms of process, given that we did otherwise have clients indicating that they would want to at least not include it into Amsterdam, I would, at this point, then ask

445
01:07:52.130 --> 01:08:01.609
Ansgar Dietrichs: Did any client… would any client want to revise their opinion on this now? Otherwise, I would feel obliged to still go with the client decisions. But of course, if the client listening to this

446
01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: Would want to revise their…

447
01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:08.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: stance on the CIP, I'd be more than happy to hold off from the DFI decision.

448
01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:28.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: then I… I do think that…

449
01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:37.849
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, just process-wise, it seems like it's pretty anonymous text by clients to not have this in Glamstadam. I do think…

450
01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:43.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: It might be a good idea to try to see if we can have a way to… Pass this…

451
01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:48.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: ongoing conversation about the CIP with clients before we get to the next…

452
01:08:48.939 --> 01:09:02.879
Ansgar Dietrichs: PFI phase for… for HSA, which indeed would only be 6 months down the road. So, if there's… I think it might be worth looking into a potential breakout process for this, to… to keep going.

453
01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:12.520
Greg Colvin: Anything we can do to keep this rolling.

454
01:09:14.170 --> 01:09:17.600
Greg Colvin: Because otherwise, you know, pretty much…

455
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:27.520
Greg Colvin: 9 years into trying to get this work done for Ethereum, I will… Have to say… Goodbye.

456
01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:30.089
Greg Colvin: It's not what I want to do.

457
01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:34.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah.

458
01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:40.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: bam… I think that is a strong case to try to keep the process rolling.

459
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:43.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: I would say, in terms of process, then I'll follow

460
01:09:43.370 --> 01:09:51.579
Ansgar Dietrichs: go and say we will re-DFI it for Glamstadam itself, and just make a note that we try to

461
01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:55.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: Keep this going, and not just revisit this in 6 months.

462
01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.050
Greg Colvin: Yeah, I mean…

463
01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:07.270
Greg Colvin: Excuse me. Yeah, I'm sorry. So that means we get a breakout room going, or we,

464
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:20.640
Greg Colvin: resolved to… to really get a discussion going on the magicians, but not just, you know, leave this sit for 6 months, or to have

465
01:10:20.770 --> 01:10:32.879
Greg Colvin: Some sort of consensus that, yes, 6 months down the road, we will have reviewed this and be ready to make… be ready to make a decision after all this time.

466
01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:50.909
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I don't think we can make a formal commitment process-wise, but I do think that it would be quite helpful if people can go find the ETH Magician's post, so we make progress on this. And, Nick's on chat is saying.

467
01:10:51.090 --> 01:10:57.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. Protocol support can help facilitate this, to make sure that there's actual follow-up, not just empty words.

468
01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:02.489
Greg Colvin: And then a breakout room is the process at this point, too.

469
01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:07.020
Greg Colvin: to get a core devs discussion going on this.

470
01:11:07.850 --> 01:11:09.089
Greg Colvin: Am I right?

471
01:11:11.440 --> 01:11:16.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: I would leave that call up to protocol support, but Nick, so if you… do you have a…

472
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:20.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: It does seem like there's interest in a breakout, indeed, in chat.

473
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.170
nixo: Yeah, I think that's the right way to keep this conversation going.

474
01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:38.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then we will have a breakout, and then, for us to be able to move forward now, I would just leave it at this. Greg, do you have anything more, or is that… does that satisfy?

475
01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: The situation for the moment.

476
01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.609
Greg Colvin: Well, thank you, yes.

477
01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:46.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

478
01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:47.320
Greg Colvin: then…

479
01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:53.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: We have another ERP right under this one, ERP 8013.

480
01:11:53.590 --> 01:12:04.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: static relative jumps and calls for the EVM, also listed as a potential DFI candidate potential, just because, all clients had

481
01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:13.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: B, C, or D, votes, but there was no conversation about it last call, so I wanted to check back whether anyone has changed their mind on this one either.

482
01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:29.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise, I would just DFI 8013 now.

483
01:12:33.330 --> 01:12:35.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, that's DFI.

484
01:12:36.570 --> 01:12:51.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then one last one in the section, EIP8024. That one was, I think, maybe together with the refund mechanism, the one that had the strongest support last call, that's the backwards compatible swap and dupe and exchange.

485
01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:55.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: op codes, we have 3 clients that put it into S tier.

486
01:12:55.990 --> 01:12:57.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: And…

487
01:12:57.950 --> 01:13:11.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: and overall had strong support on Last Call Voice, and testing also saying that it would be a small change. I would propose we see if I had anything come up over the last two weeks, four weeks that would make that a bad decision.

488
01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:25.079
Ansgar Dietrichs: Casper, you're unmuted? No. Okay.

489
01:13:27.250 --> 01:13:29.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then, yeah, the decision CFI.

490
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:36.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: That one will then be in the glamstam scope. Okay, can we scroll down to the next sections?

491
01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:53.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, on cryptography there, I think some of the early comments from Nico was related to cryptography, but my understanding is that that was regarding the… with regards to the post-quantum precompiles. Is that right, Nico? Can you… can you clarify that? So, given that those are not currently in the

492
01:13:54.250 --> 01:14:03.239
Ansgar Dietrichs: DFI candidate list? We could skip this for now? Or was… were your comments also regarding the two that are marked as DFI candidates?

493
01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:10.219
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah, so actually the two that are here are in the list. There is another one that is not in the list.

494
01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:13.969
Nicolas Consigny: Which is AT52, like…

495
01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:27.300
Nicolas Consigny: we wrote this one, and I realized, two days after the deadline that there was a deadline, so hence my comment on the needs to, reference these deadlines within EIP1.

496
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:33.239
Nicolas Consigny: But the two that are, I think, yeah, both of them are, in the list,

497
01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:35.480
Nicolas Consigny: So we can definitely discuss them.

498
01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:40.160
Nicolas Consigny: And, yeah, I can go, maybe Dano has a…

499
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:42.260
Nicolas Consigny: a point, too, to make, I assume.

500
01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:49.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: Wait, but can you clarify? You're talking about 67… 7619 and 8051, is this the tool that you're talking about?

501
01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:55.330
Nicolas Consigny: Yes, I think both of them, if I'm not mistaken, are… In the list.

502
01:14:55.970 --> 01:15:04.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes, but they're not CFI or DFI candidates for now, so we would… we can revisit this towards the end of the call if we have time. I assume we won't have time today, but…

503
01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:07.009
Nicolas Consigny: Oh, okay. Okay, I see. Yeah, okay.

504
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.460
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

505
01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:14.010
Danno Ferrin (Tectonic): Should we just go ahead and DFI Falcon? There's good reasons to DFI it, but keep MLDSA open as a question.

506
01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:17.270
Nicolas Consigny: I would agree with that statement, yep.

507
01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:28.860
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, I mean, sure, I'm always happy to take unexpected DFI decisions, given that the people involved in this process are recommending this.

508
01:15:28.860 --> 01:15:32.609
Danno Ferrin (Tectonic): Keep my notes in the comments, there's very good reason to wait on it.

509
01:15:33.810 --> 01:15:40.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so anyone who, for some reason, really wants to… is opposing DFI-ing a Falcon?

510
01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:54.540
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we DFI DIP7619 Falcon for Glamstadon.

511
01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.790
Ansgar Dietrichs: And we will discuss the other one in that section,

512
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:17.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: later, but for now, we move on to the DFI candidates that we have marked, which is these other two, secondary signature algorithms and the P256 transaction support. Overall, on last call, there was a lot of skepticism around these two with regard also to the

513
01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: And…

514
01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:33.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: kind of future account obstruction strategy, things like that. The P256 transaction support had pretty, pretty universal, projection. The, 7932 did have.

515
01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.029
Ansgar Dietrichs: It was, was ranked quite high by, by,

516
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:53.230
Ansgar Dietrichs: by Bisu, if I'm not mistaken, so I did want to maybe double-check on this one. But otherwise, basically, both of those would be DFI candidates. So do we have anyone that specifically would not want to DFI?

517
01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:59.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: either of those two, and in particular, maybe for 7932, whether Beso Has it?

518
01:16:59.450 --> 01:17:01.210
Ansgar Dietrichs: Tesla opinion on this.

519
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:08.409
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, our opinion on 7932 is really more of a PQ, preparation.

520
01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.550
Justin Florentine (Besu): step.

521
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:22.420
Justin Florentine (Besu): So we see this as sooner rather than later. I don't know that we feel strongly enough that we'll fight hard against DFI, but we see this more as a CFI question mark.

522
01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:33.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, that's why I was bringing it up, because I think that that's exactly how I perceived the basic position. All the other clients seem to…

523
01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:38.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: think that Lamsdam would be premature, at least, on this point.

524
01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:50.349
Ansgar Dietrichs: So then I would… yeah, I would… Justin… yeah, would you… do you think, from the base side, it would be okay if we just push this one hot fog and we revisit this… this question for… for Ichtar?

525
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:52.220
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yes.

526
01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Then I think we can…

527
01:17:58.130 --> 01:18:01.810
Ansgar Dietrichs: go ahead with the PlumsetMDFI decision on both of these.

528
01:18:03.950 --> 01:18:04.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: And…

529
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:13.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and then there's one last section here, that's the other section with some miscellaneous EAPs. The first tier is,

530
01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:18.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: period, or the kind of periods related to proposals.

531
01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:28.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: 64… 04 and 6466. We talked about it, last call.

532
01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: And…

533
01:18:31.230 --> 01:18:44.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: overall, it seemed like clients did not feel like it was a priority for Glamstadam. I said, if, you know, if people change their minds, that that would have to happen until this call, so the question is, have people changed their minds here, or can we

534
01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.339
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do we want to go ahead and DFI these?

535
01:18:51.930 --> 01:18:57.919
Barnabas: Just one quick question. Is 7932 and 8030 handled together as…

536
01:18:58.250 --> 01:19:05.490
Barnabas: one decision, because as far as I know, we just made a decision for $79.32, but not for 8030.

537
01:19:06.390 --> 01:19:15.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, sure, fair point. We can revert back, just to double check. 80-30, yes, I was intending to have it be a shared decision, but, that's obviously… there's no reason to do that.

538
01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:35.679
Ansgar Dietrichs: The main reason with 8030 was just that every single client that expressed an opinion, so everyone except for Rats, put it into D tier, which to me, implied, that it would not really have a chance in this artwork, but, yeah, is there anyone that would want to speak up in favor of 8030?

539
01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:56.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Barnabas to use?

540
01:19:57.050 --> 01:20:02.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, do you have anything in favor of the AP that you'd want to bring up?

541
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:18.259
Barnabas: Yeah, so the only reason I brought this up, because we just included the SAC256R precompiled in Fusaka, and it's just interesting to me that we do not want this P256, because it would be, like, the…

542
01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.489
Barnabas: completion of, finishing what we started in Fusaka, I think.

543
01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.050
Barnabas: Maybe I misunderstood the IP?

544
01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:32.089
Ansgar Dietrichs: My understanding is that it's not just a precompile, but an actual new transaction type.

545
01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:43.010
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, we… so we already… I think the reason not to do this is partly because we just shipped this in Fusaka. We already get most of the benefits from…

546
01:20:44.150 --> 01:20:45.900
Carl Beekhuizen: like, of having R1…

547
01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:51.540
Carl Beekhuizen: On-chain by what we did in Fusaka. This is just whether we want to support it more natively.

548
01:20:52.460 --> 01:21:03.270
Carl Beekhuizen: So, to me, that means, like, it's only if we want to see, like, even more adoption of this, and don't like that you don't have a native R01 transaction type.

549
01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:07.489
Carl Beekhuizen: Secondly, I do want to raise that 8030 does require 7932.

550
01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.779
Carl Beekhuizen: So we do, if we're including 8030, we do need to include 7932 as well.

551
01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anya and Nico?

552
01:21:17.710 --> 01:21:24.650
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah, I… I agree with Carl. I think we have most of the benefits, thanks to the precompile, and…

553
01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:34.370
Nicolas Consigny: Adding this is, first, like, not very aligned with the PQ strategy, because basically we would make a lot of e-forths to include a new transaction type.

554
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:38.600
Nicolas Consigny: To find a way to deactivate it.

555
01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:47.579
Nicolas Consigny: Maybe in one fork, because we were talking about the PQ precompile and PQ emergency plan at the same time. So to me, it really doesn't make sense.

556
01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:52.050
Nicolas Consigny: Both from a strategy and technical point of view.

557
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:58.499
Nicolas Consigny: we… we have a cheap R1 precompiled. Also, like, the R1 curve is,

558
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:12.800
Nicolas Consigny: Is, yeah, doesn't have, nothing under its sleeve, proofs, so, like, we can't really know, all the details of the parameters, so, like, activating it as a native, curve adds more risk.

559
01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:17.740
Nicolas Consigny: So yeah, to me, I would say no to both, I guess.

560
01:22:21.350 --> 01:22:28.739
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, then, I do think we are probably still in the same position to make a DFI decision, or did anyone…

561
01:22:28.850 --> 01:22:30.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: Want to change the mind here?

562
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:48.460
Ansgar Dietrichs: then we go ahead with DFI. So then that gets us back to the two pure, EIPs. Did we have anyone that would want to speak up in favor of those?

563
01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then, otherwise, I'll, DFI… I'll propose we deify both of those.

564
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:10.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

565
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:13.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then those of those elements are deified.

566
01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:18.149
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then one last, one that was a candidate here.

567
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:27.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: is the sparse blot pool. Now, I wasn't sure, from glancing at the AP, whether this has any in-protocol changes, or whether this is a pure, kind of, out-of-protocol.

568
01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:31.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: questions, so I'm not sure, also.

569
01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:36.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: how much people have already looked into this. Overall, it seemed like there was…

570
01:23:36.460 --> 01:23:40.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: Relatively strong support for this.

571
01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:46.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does it make sense to… Cfi this today.

572
01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:50.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Marius, maybe, if you can give some context?

573
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:59.480
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, it's… it's out of protocol, but, I think it is very important.

574
01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:05.040
Marius van der Wijden: And it is not super easy, so, client teams

575
01:24:05.190 --> 01:24:09.750
Marius van der Wijden: Need to set aside some engineering time for it.

576
01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:21.120
Marius van der Wijden: I guess that is why it was… proposed to ACD, so that It can, like…

577
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:24.910
Marius van der Wijden: It can be, bank teams.

578
01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.400
Marius van der Wijden: If we included client teams concept, set aside the engineer time.

579
01:24:30.010 --> 01:24:34.289
Marius van der Wijden: When thinking about the scope of the… of the fork.

580
01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:39.059
Marius van der Wijden: I think it is very important.

581
01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.280
Marius van der Wijden: For increasing the block… Coned.

582
01:24:42.410 --> 01:24:45.769
Marius van der Wijden: We will probably not be able to go to…

583
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:53.180
Marius van der Wijden: the massive blob counts that we envisioned without this, so… Yeah.

584
01:24:57.660 --> 01:24:58.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: And for all?

585
01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:08.909
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so just to add to that, yeah, double-click on that, and specifically with, on the consensus layer, we're already…

586
01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:27.019
Raúl Kripalani: working on testing and interoping on the partial messages, side of things on Gossip Sub, and that basically is the whole idea of cell-level messaging. So with that, we will be removing peer-to-peer, like, all…

587
01:25:27.020 --> 01:25:30.829
Raúl Kripalani: network inefficiencies from the CL, where we're right now.

588
01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:36.210
Raúl Kripalani: Transporting data that, you know, the node already has, and…

589
01:25:36.270 --> 01:25:52.590
Raúl Kripalani: that will basically unleash the CL, but then the EL will become the bottleneck, because it is still fully replicating blobs in the mempool. So that will be… we predict that around 72 blob down, that will start becoming the choke point for the system.

590
01:25:52.610 --> 01:26:10.070
Raúl Kripalani: And that's why we submitted the CIP. It is, right now, I would say, like, 90% confident that this can be rolled out progressively, and, like, it can be an opt-in, and over time, in… within the, like, even before Glamsterdam.

591
01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:28.120
Raúl Kripalani: some nodes can already start supporting it. We still have to conduct some assessment there to analyze any risk for, like, network partitioning and so on, or block pool partitioning, if… so this is not entirely clear yet. So, the rationale for submitting this is to have a clear checkpoint that the network

592
01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:39.040
Raúl Kripalani: should support this feature entirely as a whole by Glamstadam, but also to carve out some space in case we do actually, like, there is some…

593
01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:48.429
Raúl Kripalani: Some possibility that we do need, a fully coordinated rollout, just to… in case we detect some risks of partitioning.

594
01:26:53.730 --> 01:27:01.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, and that was the general question, on the last call, how we would handle, proposed ERPs that do not have

595
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:21.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: protocol changes, that I put the other three that were in that category in the process box down there. None of them were, for now, like, the CFI candidates, because we wanted to first make that decision. I mean, Raul, as you're saying, this one here specifically at least has the potential to want to specifically be at the hardware boundary.

596
01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: M…

597
01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:31.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: I personally do think having non-protocol change EIPs in a hard fork to just signal prioritization can make sense.

598
01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:45.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, process-wise, is this… does this include any changes on the CL side directly? So is this something that… is this a CFI decision that we would have to make together with the ACDC side, or is this an EL side only?

599
01:27:48.960 --> 01:28:02.140
Raúl Kripalani: There are some engine API changes, specifically for the CL to communicate to the EL any custody set changes, and that is pretty much it. As well, to receive cells only.

600
01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:19.089
Raúl Kripalani: from the CL, but that's… from the EL, but that's actually coming sooner with V3. So it's really just the custody signaling side of things. So the change on the CL is very, very lightweight. I don't expect it to be… to be a blocker, and definitely not something that is consensus-breaking.

601
01:28:20.260 --> 01:28:42.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then in terms of process, I think at least what we can consider here is CFI-ing it with the understanding that that's conditional on double-checking on the ACDC side, but because we have so much of this ping-pong, like, here, the decision would be on our side, and it's just a double-checking. Is there any unexpected concerns regarding that, engine API? So that would basically be, like, a one-week stay of.

602
01:28:42.930 --> 01:28:43.380
Raúl Kripalani: Yes.

603
01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:55.979
Ansgar Dietrichs: of a poll decision, but the question is, do we in general already have, even on the EL side, do we have enough support here? Do we have enough consensus that this is important, that we would want to make the CFI call today?

604
01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:12.379
Ansgar Dietrichs: We had, client-wise, we had, 1S and two A's for this, so that did seem to signal pretty strong, overall support.

605
01:29:12.530 --> 01:29:14.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maurice just spoke up in favor of it.

606
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:15.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: M.

607
01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:21.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: I can, to step out of the coordinator role briefly, I can personally also express support, but…

608
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:27.369
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is there anyone that would basically specifically prefer to not have CFI today?

609
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:39.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, and I do think we make the decision today that,

610
01:29:40.150 --> 01:29:46.829
Ansgar Dietrichs: we basically mark it as CFI, conditional on double-checking on the CL site, in a week.

611
01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:54.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then we, add through the list. Now…

612
01:29:54.300 --> 01:30:07.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: Good news is we made quite a few individual decisions, so this will cut down the list quite a bit. Thank you for sticking with me, this was a bit tedious, I understand that. Bad news is that we also now have, 4 minutes left.

613
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:23.689
Ansgar Dietrichs: And we specifically did not talk about any of the sections that require continued discussions, that were not just decision-ready. I think in… because of… in the interest of time, what I will do is I'll just briefly walk through that list that I put up on the agenda that's also just

614
01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:46.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: my take on where there are open questions, so this is not at all necessarily, like, fully accurate or conclusive, but I do think the goal would be that in two weeks, we specifically focus on these open questions, no general purpose CFI, DFI discussions, unless maybe on the side if they come up, but really the focus on next ACDC… ACD will be to work through all of these individual questions.

615
01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:50.860
Ansgar Dietrichs: I'll briefly go through them. So, the questions that we have is.

616
01:30:50.990 --> 01:31:04.879
Ansgar Dietrichs: On the repricing side, in terms of the core gas, repricing, so that is not the state growth question specifically, but everything else, in the core, in this proposed core bundle, there was pretty strong interest,

617
01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:16.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: Last call to consider unbundling this, and then in response, the champions, and that includes me, are working on a proposal to just basically regroup this in a more palatable

618
01:31:16.170 --> 01:31:21.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: Form, so by 2 weeks from now, we would have to have a basis for

619
01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:23.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Of, of that work to, to discuss.

620
01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:41.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: repricings, on the state growth side, that was one… that's just the one EIP that we have proposed right now, 8037, but there were questions of, is this quite the right approach? And there were two alternative proposals. We have, a write-up by Anders. I will…

621
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:45.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Post that in the chat.

622
01:31:46.380 --> 01:32:03.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: For people to look at, to compare these, the different ones. Also, by the way, Raul, your hand is still up, just, just to mention. So, so we have this right up by, by Andes on this point. Then we have the, topic of contract size increase. There's

623
01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:11.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: none of those had… it basically has two set… two alternative approaches. Neither of them had clear support, and it seemed like…

624
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:18.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: we had, on the one hand, we had Geth and Guillaume that preferred the chunk-based mobilization, and then we had

625
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:33.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: other clients preferring the existing approach that we had already considered for Fusaka. So that one, I think we just need to resolve. Do we want to do one of the two, or do we want to do nothing?

626
01:32:33.220 --> 01:32:38.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: hopefully a decision in two weeks. And then on the…

627
01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:44.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: In the utility transaction block features block, we had, some…

628
01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:56.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: updates by Zolt on 7745. I will note that Geth and Zolt were quite interested in this EIP, but most other clients

629
01:32:56.650 --> 01:33:09.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: had concerns, so I'll post the update in… in chat, just to flag that we will make a decision there in two weeks as well. And then cryptography, post-quantum precompiles.

630
01:33:09.120 --> 01:33:21.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: This is also what Nico came here to talk about. I think, Nico, I see your hand is up. I will say that we don't really have the time to go into this for now. The question there basically is.

631
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:32.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: for these is… well, we made one decision today. We made one DFI decision on Parkins, so the question on the other one is, is Glamstadlam the right time or not?

632
01:33:32.090 --> 01:33:43.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: I do have… yeah, okay, then I appreciate that you took on the hand, because I think it's better to call… talk about it on next call. And then the last block of decisions we have to make is…

633
01:33:43.040 --> 01:34:01.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: for these three, non-protocol changing EIPs beyond the SPASM block pool, yeah, how do we handle those? So, all of these questions are listed on the agenda for today, so maybe people can have a look at that, and, I'll also

634
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:05.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: Try to coordinate with people a little bit more, so in two weeks, we do have

635
01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:07.939
Ansgar Dietrichs: A good basis for decisions on this one.

636
01:34:08.430 --> 01:34:12.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mmm… Tony, do you… you have a comment?

637
01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:22.310
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, do we… I mean, now it's almost too late, but do we also want to talk about the data repricing APs? If I remember correctly, like, 4 out of 5 clients?

638
01:34:22.630 --> 01:34:30.200
Toni Wahrstätter: had the call data pricing at the S tier, so it might make sense to CFI. We have CFI DFPs that had way less support today.

639
01:34:31.120 --> 01:34:48.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, the problem is just that there were questions about the specific approach to these repricing APs, so whether we want to select them one by one, or consider them more as a grouping. I would, for that reason, hold off for now, although, yes, I think it seemed pretty clear that we will have

640
01:34:48.820 --> 01:35:01.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: a repricing in the fork that will touch data. So, I think that's clear, but, like, just in terms of process, because otherwise, if we open that box now… I mean, now we can't open it anyway anymore, but that's why we didn't bring it up on this call yet.

641
01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.810
Toni Wahrstätter: Okay, no, that's fine. It's fine, we don't need to discuss that. Okay.

642
01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:13.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, and then I just mentioned the housekeeping we didn't get to, H-star name, we need to make a name decision, there's a link,

643
01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:17.699
Ansgar Dietrichs: In… in the agenda, go and…

644
01:35:18.130 --> 01:35:21.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: figure that out, everyone. And then there are…

645
01:35:21.950 --> 01:35:33.719
Ansgar Dietrichs: comments that we should, clarify, kind of minimum hard fork testnet and maintenance rollout timelines on a future call. So all of that, hopefully, we get to in two weeks, but for today, that's all. Thank you, everyone, for your time.

646
01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:39.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: I hope it was worth all of these micro-decisions, and talk to you all in two weeks.

647
01:35:40.750 --> 01:35:42.160
Toni Wahrstätter: Thanks, everyone, bye-bye.

648
01:35:43.790 --> 01:35:44.410
lightclient: Yep.
