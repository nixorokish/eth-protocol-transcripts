00:33:36	Danno Ferrin (Tectonic):	Replying to "To address the PQ pr..."

Yes, a full EOA solution is not needed to provide value. a PQ precompile can still be used for smart wallets (safe, 4337) as well as sigining messages.

We hit the solidity verifiers (available today)
00:35:41	Danno Ferrin (Tectonic):	Replying to "To address the PQ pr..."

00:36:27	Anders Elowsson:	Regarding EIP-8011, the issue with DFI is EIP-8037. We should ideally remain open to a metering approach similar or identical to EIP-8011 that only  is focused on separating state creation, as well as an approach similar or identical to EIP-8075 for this purpose. It would be appropriate to wait with taking a decision on how to process state creation until we know how strong price increases that are necessary. 

I have prepared a document outlining the three different paradigms for how the protocol can process state creation operations: https://notes.ethereum.org/@anderselowsson/3-paradigms-for-state-creation-repricing

00:38:47	Nicolas Consigny:	I get your point and we both want PQ resilience ASAP. Still I would rather have a combination of solutions rather than isolated PQ precompiles which could lead ACD to think that "problem is solved". In an emergency scenario not everyone will act fast so EOAs are rekt
00:40:02	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Can’t the private key actually override the smart EOA signing? So the precompiles actually do not protect against PQ today. Now, there was an EIP to disable private keys floating around

We can have a smooth transition in H*. That's why I am advocating for ACD to consider a "full" solution ASAP. As I am afraid one isolated PQ precompile could be seen as "good enough for now" until we actually hit the wall

Someone should procude a working “emergency zk proof from seed” circuit instead of talking about it.  Until it’s been demonstrated it is execisable and as long as we have zero post-quantum DSAs we have zero backup we can activate on short notice.
00:45:42	Nicolas Consigny:	Replying to "To address the PQ pr..."

So TLDR PQ precompiles gud. We need them ASAP. But we need ACD to understand that just this doesn't bring PQ resilience nor a good PQ emergency plan

A small issue in the process is that there is no prioritization taken into account.

So if we CFI 10 EIPs with lower priority and keep it open about some others "a bit more important" due to technical questions being open, then the volume of CFIed EIPs might lead to DFI-ing the remaining ones (even more important)

i don't think tx signatures should be left up to only the application layer. a signature type byte goes a long way to future proofing ethereum.
01:27:08	Marius van der Wijden:	Oh we also need a fully coordinated rollout for eth/70
01:27:19	Marius van der Wijden:	We could bundle it with a bpo

01:27:40	Barnabas:	Yeah I think non protocol coordinated things should be targetting BPOs

‘Not Now’ is indistinguishable with ‘never’ when there is no threshold to cross.  What is that threshold? Needing other issues to clear out will never change because new issues will always be considered more important.

A flat “no” will make planning easier.
01:29:16	draganrakita:	Replying to "Dfi ssz for now pls"

Imo, I could live with not doing ssz at all. It will always be a low priority imo.
01:29:19	Raúl Kripalani:	Yeah the center of gravity for this is the EL
01:29:33	Dustin:	Replying to "Dfi ssz for now pls"

On very few topics, though, is there a commitment to "never" in a positive sense
01:29:38	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "Dfi ssz for now pls"

Put Claude working on it
01:29:46	Dustin:	Replying to "Dfi ssz for now pls"

It would be strange to do that specifically for SSZ
01:29:54	Raúl Kripalani:	SG, thanks!
01:29:54	Danno Ferrin (Tectonic):	Replying to "my assumption is the..."

Also L2s can experiment with non L1 signaures with a type byte, for example. If they don’t have issues with P256 they can support P256 without requiring L1 ot adopt.
