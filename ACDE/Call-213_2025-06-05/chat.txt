To be clear, I'm not opposed to DC builders in general, though I do worry about resiliency when you start depending on too few actors.  See power outage in Spain vs power outage in Africa.  When outages are common, people have backups.  When outages are rare, people don't have backups.  When you have a small number of operators you can run into problems with there being no backups when they do go down.

@Paritosh The few remaining people who casually run Ethereum on their consumer hardware already drop history and prune state.  The lowest you can get right now is under 100GB, and 4444 won't change this at all because those people already have locally implemented the equivalent.  The increase in gas limit will increase state growth and those people are the ones most impacted, not people who are storing all of history and disabling pruning.

I believe they are.  Bitcoin originally normalized it, and then Ethereum picked up on the ethos that people can do things from home, be it running your own Bitcoin node, or running totally private dapps.  This used to be a big focus of a lot of things, but it no longer seems to be.

right, zkEVM in itself only helps create very light weight stateless nodes.

It also enables cpu-light stateful nodes (if they don’t need tracing / only selective tracing), but then ofc they still need to be able to handle the state at whatever larger size it will be

The smaller the footprint, the more people who can run.  We do have to make a call and I think it is safe to say that 10GB is out of the question at this point (though see Vitalik's post where he poses some solutions that may allow us to get down into that range by storing a subset of state).  My primary concern is that these users seem to be an afterthought, rather than a primary concern (which is what it should be IMO).  Doubling the rate of state growth without dedicating any R&D effort (and in fact cutting R&D resources) towards making home operation on limited disk hardware is problematic IMO, given that state growth is what got us into this situation in the first place.

I did voice my concerns and I was told that 7870 was only meant to be a retrospective accounting of what was required to run "full" nodes and not meant to be representative on what we were targeting or why.  Then lines were added after I reviewed it and it was merged without me realizing those changes until I found a bunch of people on Twitter telling me that anything less than 4TB was "officially unsupported for anyone running an Ethereum client".

@Justin Florentine (Besu) were we not explicit about that in the discussion on EIP-7870 a few months ago? E.g. a 4TB NVMe drive for full nodes (not stakers!) was a clear change. What we are doing now is just making use of this new headroom that EIP gave us.

Several clients have fully pruned modes that are well under 500GB today, some are trustless, and we could make trustless under 100GB possible, but cranking up the gas limit because "it is insignificant compared to the 4TB assumption" is just ignoring those users.
00:41:49	Kamil Chodoła:	Replying to "Doesn’t verkle / ..."

Recommended is a reference for testing.

30M gas -> 60M gas is a 2x increase in state growth assuming no change in behavior.  I personally expect a behavior change that will result in more storage, but that is speculation on my part so not part of my argument.  My main argument is that we should be focusing effort on keeping growth low and seriously thinking anytime we raise it.  Right now there is no principaled approach to keeping state growth down, it is just "2x growth doesn't seem so bad" with no actual analysis on how it will impact the home operator demographic.

@Paritosh Such users used to run Ethereum.  All that I used to know no longer do because of disk requirements.  Arguably more important than that though, is people need to be able to run at home as a fallback for when their country gets censored by the RPC providers.  Right now if you are someone in Venezuala getting censored, you can't install Ethereum on your computer and be back to uncensored in 16 hours.  You have to go buy new hardware, get it installed (which probably means giving your computer to a tech specialist who installs the drive for you, maybe migrates data off old drive because you only have one nVME slot, etc.), then finally sync Ethereum and use it.  I don't think we should expect everyone in Venezuala to do this.
00:55:12	Toni Wahrstaetter:	Saying that builders are the problem is not super fair bc even during the sanctions, builders included relatively more TC transactions than local builders

FOCIL definitely gives you faster inclusion but it's not like you have no inclusion guarantees today
00:55:57	Micah Zoltu:	Replying to "our values are cha..."

@Kamil The latter, the idea is that users already have computers, we shouldn't be asking them to buy another one or upgrade their existing one if they want to use Ethereum trustlessly/privately/CR.

00:57:52	Micah Zoltu:	@Lukasz Or they just can't afford to spend the money/time to access Ethereum trustlessly/privately.  They may still need or benefit from those properties, but they are out of reach when it doesn't run on their existing hardware.

We actually aren’t even talking about 2tb yet, with history expiry we’re talking about 300-600GB. Which steam stats claims ~90% of users have. So if they are actively being censored, and Ethereum is important to them - id expect them to delete some data and setup their node.

Would be okay with pay if its in a future devnet as there are a lot of edge cases to test, including it with devnet 2 might be too much with 7907 on testing side

Not directly. If it was a bigger app that was censored then only non-censoring builders would win the block auction.
Since it was only a small app (TC) we had longer inclusion times but builders (not only the big ones but also the small ones) included most sanctioned TC, not the local builders (relatively speaking since we only have 8% local builders).

you have to touch as many accounts as possible possible, thus spend your gas on writes

so no gas left for calldata and at this point you get a bigger block by investing all your available gas into calldata
01:18:50	Francesco:	Replying to "the only aspect of t..."

Like Ansgar said, there’s two orthogonal features in the current EIP, one involving reads and one involving writes (the per-tx diffs). When it comes to the state diff part of it, one aspect of it that imo mitigates these concerns is that this might be a cost that we have to pay long term. At least, at the moment I don’t see a long term architecture where we don’t want to have state diffs in the block, to be able to support stateful nodes that don’t do re-execution and partially stateful nodes (in both cases, where verification is through proofs)
01:18:56	Łukasz Rozmej:	with big increases to gas limit we might need to increase price for  SLOAD/SSTORE?

we might need to ask mr claude to setup an automation for this
01:30:40	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

Can push the work to the author/champions
01:30:47	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

Ill even do it for CL stuff if I need to
01:30:50	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

They wont do it lol
01:30:59	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

they might do it 1x
01:31:03	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

but not the 10x time
01:31:11	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

Yeah fair point
01:31:21	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

I’m pro versioning!
01:31:27	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

I think the bot should be able to do it

You will never get this fwiw

We can barely agree on Draft/review/ or CFI/SFI

01:32:11	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

can’t we just setup a semver versioning ?
01:32:14	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

bot would do that
01:32:17	Wei Tang:	If we're talking about protocol specifications then there's really not "minor" version change. Every change to the specification is backward incompatible and it's always "major" version change.
01:32:23	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

How chooses what is minor/major/etc.
01:32:27	Gary Schulte:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

yeah but a PR can implement 8.0.1, whereas a hash just implies there was a change.  

Updating the verbiage can cause a new hash
01:32:28	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

Will bikeshed forever
01:32:28	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

How does the bot resolve the semantics?
01:32:40	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

feat major
fix minor
chore minor
01:32:45	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

semver already does this
01:32:50	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

What’s a “feat"
01:32:54	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

new feature
01:32:59	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

And each tag is labeled in each PR?
01:33:03	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

yes
01:33:04	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

Yes, but what I mean is how do you define this in EIPs?
01:33:12	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

You’d still have conformance problems
01:33:15	Barnabas:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

each EIP starts with 1.0.0
01:33:22	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

I guess walidator could demand it
01:33:23	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

100x more conformance changes
01:33:28	Marc:	Replying to "If we're talking abo…"
could just be rewording, fixing typos etc.
01:33:30	stokes:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

But honestly I’d rather just use the commit hash
01:33:36	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "If we're talking abo..."

Seems reasonable to clearly distinguish between changes to an EIP that affects logic and that does not, in whatever implementation we have.
01:33:41	Wei Tang:	Replying to "If we're talking a..."

In that case it's "patch".
01:34:03	felix (eest):	Reacted to "Seems reasonable t..." with 👍
01:34:03	Gary Schulte:	Replying to "Don’t we already use..."

very bike-shreddable.  however lets not make the perfect the enemy of the good.
01:34:16	Marc:	Replying to "If we're talking abo…"
that would still change the hash though
