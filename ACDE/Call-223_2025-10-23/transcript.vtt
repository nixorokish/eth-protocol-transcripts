00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.820
Justin Florentine (Besu): Good morning, y'all.

2
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.740
Carson: Morning!

3
00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.029
Carson: Or, well, afternoon to anybody in Europe.

4
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.849
Ansgar Dietrichs: Good morning, everyone.

5
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.169
Ansgar Dietrichs: Can you all hear me alright?

6
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.899
Justin Florentine (Besu): You sound great, Ann, Scar.

7
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: Also do you, perfect.

8
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:31.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: There were some last-minute, agenda, additions.

9
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:40.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: I'm currently on Pacific time, so I just woke up, so I couldn't process them over the last 6 hours, so I just added them to the agenda. So for anyone who had a look…

10
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.230
Ansgar Dietrichs: Earlier.

11
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.239
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do you have another look.

12
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: And because the agenda got a bit more full, I ended up switching the… and we'll have the…

13
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: EIP process proposal, not at the very end, as originally planned, but a little bit early on.

14
00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah. Okay, I think we are, do we want to wait a bit longer? Do we want to get going?

15
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think we can go live now.

16
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.399
Josh Davis: Alright, you're live, Oscar.

17
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Well… Welcome, everyone, for…

18
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: for Occadevs, 223. It's gonna be a while until we have a nice number again.

19
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:31.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, this one will, I think, be primarily all about, Glamstadam…

20
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:43.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: EIP planning, but before we get into that, we do have a few Fusaka-related points, again. So, to start us off there, we have Barnabas with a quick

21
00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:49.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: update on the Sepolia BP01 and 2 situation?

22
00:05:50.850 --> 00:06:02.239
Barnabas: Yep, hi everyone. So, Future DevNet 3 is still ongoing. We have 99% participation. Every single client combination is working just fine now.

23
00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.329
Barnabas: We rolled out the latest Lighthouse image, and that solved all of our bugs as of now.

24
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.659
Barnabas: Tepolia had their BPO activated.

25
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:23.479
Barnabas: 2 days ago, we went up to max blobs of 15, and the next BPO will be in 4 days and 9 hours.

26
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.139
Barnabas: The next fork will be,

27
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.189
Barnabas: than the Hudi network, which will get its, Fusaka update in 5 days and 4 hours.

28
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:43.070
Barnabas: And then the first BPO will be in approximately 2 weeks from now. And, in 19 days BPO, too, on Houdi.

29
00:06:46.830 --> 00:07:03.539
Barnabas: everything went smoothly on BP01, and we expect a smooth transition on Hoodie as well. If you're running a Hudi validator, please make sure that you update your node, as there's only 5 years left now till the fork.

30
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.890
Barnabas: That's about it for the testnets.

31
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you, and it's great to see that it's going so smoothly.

32
00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:22.079
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is that… were there any comments? Did anyone have anything specifically regarding the testnets, regarding Sepolia, or the upcoming HUDI?

33
00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: Folks that they wanted to discuss?

34
00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.139
Barnabas: Maybe just one more, point. Pulaski is officially going away next week.

35
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:42.659
Barnabas: It's already seeing some drop in participation. We are close to on finalization at this point. We are at the low 70s.

36
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:55.240
Barnabas: So, if you're running a host key validator, just keep it up, till you can, and then we're gonna be officially shutting it off next week, Friday.

37
00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:06.879
Barnabas: And if you're listening, and you still have infrastructure running in OSCI, please migrate to Polia or Houdi as soon as possible.

38
00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, perfect. That… thank you for that,

39
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:22.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and so if anyone still has anything on their bucket list that they really wanted to get done on Holsky, now is your time.

40
00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:35.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then next up, with everything going so smoothly, Alex wanted to talk about, mainnet dates.

41
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.250
Ansgar Dietrichs: Alex, do you want to start us off? We then have a few comments to go through.

42
00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:50.049
stokes: Yeah, definitely. So, last week, let's see, let me just make sure I have the right dates here…

43
00:08:50.279 --> 00:09:00.099
stokes: So, essentially, the proposal would be to follow, this document from Barnabas, which I can drop here in the chat, one second.

44
00:09:02.529 --> 00:09:12.959
stokes: And what does that have? So it has, mainnet for Fusakra on December 3rd. You can look at the Bakken slot there in the dock.

45
00:09:13.459 --> 00:09:20.049
stokes: BP01 and 2 on December 9th, and then on January 7th, respectively. So…

46
00:09:20.489 --> 00:09:28.679
stokes: We brought this up on last week's ACDC as sort of a temperature check, and…

47
00:09:28.789 --> 00:09:32.459
stokes: Was I… are you talking about the doc part of this? I just saw the chat here.

48
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:49.780
Barnabas: Yeah, so the original, BF01 proposal was the 17th of December, and we have… there was a bit of pushback from different client teams, saying that the 17th of December falls a bit too close,

49
00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.370
Barnabas: to Christmas and the holidays.

50
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:59.029
Barnabas: So we decided to, propose the 9th as BPO1.

51
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:06.350
stokes: I see, okay, so the dock hasn't updated, but yeah, it was moved from last time. Okay, thanks for calling it out.

52
00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:13.250
stokes: But yeah, so then check the doc for the latest times, but, yeah, long story short…

53
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:21.159
stokes: We did, like, a temperature check, last call. People were generally on board, so I wanted to do the same thing here.

54
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.260
stokes: So, I think one caveat is if we follow our process doc, I think, you know, when reading, it says basically we would wait to officially set these dates.

55
00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:34.789
stokes: Until Hoodie has finalized, which will be next week.

56
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.970
stokes: That being said, if we want to go with the schedule, the timing's pretty tight, and so…

57
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:50.679
stokes: That would ultimately look like client releases on… I believe that's November 3rd, so one week before… or sorry, one month before the proposed mainnet date.

58
00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:56.680
stokes: And just given the timing, it makes sense to go ahead and get this on people's radars now.

59
00:10:56.900 --> 00:11:04.339
stokes: yeah, I would like to go ahead and see what people think about this here. Generally, I'd say from the CL side, we're gonna go with these dates.

60
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:09.989
stokes: If we're good to go from the EL side, which we can, you know, assess on this call right now.

61
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:19.340
stokes: then I would say, you know, basically we'll do this, we can follow our process and go ahead and confirm, officially on next week's ACDC.

62
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:29.159
stokes: But, wanted to go ahead and get this on people's radars, just so they're aware, because, yeah, you know, you'll have more time to get a release together if you're a client team.

63
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:43.120
stokes: And I guess, final note, this is all conditional on hoodie going well, so again, if something doesn't for some reason, then yeah, we'll have to adjust. But so far, it's been going well, and it seems like we can pull this off, so…

64
00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:50.530
stokes: That's my spiel, and I'd love to hear from any EL teams or anyone else on the call, what they think about this.

65
00:11:55.250 --> 00:12:00.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, perfect, thank you. We already have a few comments in the chat from Lukash and Marius.

66
00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: Plus running.

67
00:12:02.610 --> 00:12:04.500
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anyone else with comments on…

68
00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: This…

69
00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.250
Ansgar Dietrichs: So maybe if we briefly just…

70
00:12:24.430 --> 00:12:28.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: Check, go through the… the client teams,

71
00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:37.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: to see, is there… is there anyone from Reth on the call with an opinion on this? Do these dates look reasonable from your side?

72
00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:39.160
Jen: Yeah, looks good.

73
00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:44.839
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And from the peso side?

74
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.210
Justin Florentine (Besu): No issues here.

75
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome, and Aragon?

76
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:55.990
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, sounds good.

77
00:12:56.850 --> 00:12:58.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, did I miss any client?

78
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: I don't… I hope so.

79
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: You know, please, no more clients, I need one hand to count, and so this is great.

80
00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then when we… yeah.

81
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:34.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: Alex, you already mentioned that, basically, because there was also some discussions in the issue, Andrew mentioned that, yeah, the process specifically would then officially only make these dates, let us set these dates next week, but basically the idea is we pre…

82
00:13:34.570 --> 00:13:39.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: Pre-committing to this timeline, assuming, hoodie goes smoothly.

83
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:53.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect. We will, a bit later on, talk about the GlumSlam EAP process, because then the question is also, does this then today already trigger the deadline for ERP proposals? So that would mean,

84
00:13:53.340 --> 00:14:02.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: now would be the last week that would start today, basically, for your pre-proposals, but let's get into that once we get to Amsterdam.

85
00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:10.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: which actually we will do immediately now. So, any last comments on the actual timeline?

86
00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:30.400
Barnabas: Just one mention that I've proposed to basically clarify the mainnet update requirement, instead of maintenance should not have an upgraded set until all testnets have been upgraded, to manage should not have an upgrade date set until at least one testnet has been upgraded.

87
00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.560
Barnabas: I'm just curious what everyone thinks of this.

88
00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.269
Barnabas: I posted the PR for that, in the chat.

89
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:40.440
Barnabas: Continuity.

90
00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.559
Barnabas: So this would basically allow us to schedule, the mainnet right now.

91
00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:55.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Put us?

92
00:14:56.210 --> 00:15:03.820
potuz: I'm not against this, but one issue that this raises is that our users might update the client.

93
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:09.329
potuz: With a testnet release that has the mainnet date.

94
00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:21.860
potuz: But it's not really considered to be a mainnet release. Like, we are still releasing things, even though we've already been through a couple of testnets upgrades, and we still find bugs.

95
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:36.669
potuz: And clients that, if we go with this thing of, like, setting a date well in advance after just one testnet upgrade, we might see users that haven't really upgraded to the actual mainnet release with all the bug fixes.

96
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:44.710
Ben Adams: Yeah, we don't need to put the dates in a release until… Closer to the race.

97
00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.689
Ben Adams: If that makes sense.

98
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.539
Barnabas: Yeah, it's… it would still be up to the clients when they want to back in the data.

99
00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:00.469
Barnabas: It's just that we could officially schedule today.

100
00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:18.709
stokes: I guess one note is, I believe there's an escape hatch in this document. Let me go see if I can find the text, but basically it just says, like, you know, this is all subject to change at the whims of…

101
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:25.019
stokes: ACD. The thing with this is that…

102
00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:30.749
stokes: it doesn't say which testnets, and, like, I think not all of them are created equal, essentially.

103
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.659
stokes: But yeah, I think we could go either way.

104
00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is this something that we'd prefer to make a decision on today, on the call, or would we rather take that discussion offline?

105
00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.180
Marius van der Wijden: I…

106
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:13.739
Marius van der Wijden: I prefer to set the date more in advance and have, like, people know the date, rather than following some arbitrary document that someone drafted up a long time ago.

107
00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.290
Ben Adams: Yeah, I think…

108
00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:20.230
Marius van der Wijden: Basically, predictability for the ecosystem.

109
00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.229
Ben Adams: I think POTUS's concern is addressed by not

110
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.740
Ben Adams: Putting the dates into an actual release.

111
00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:29.010
Ben Adams: Until later.

112
00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:30.820
Ben Adams: Would that be correct, buddy?

113
00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:43.469
potuz: Yeah, so the… I mean, there are other issues, too. Like, on P2P, you advertise, when you have the next fork epoch, you change your ENR and a bunch of things,

114
00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:58.880
potuz: So the fork schedule changes, and this changes the configuration of clients, so we might have clients that are already announcing what the next fork is, and some clients that don't. It's not really a serious problem, it's just something to think about.

115
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:16.999
Ansgar Dietrichs: So could it make sense to have, like, an explicit decoupling of these two, points in time in the document? That we basically, like, we go with this proposed change, in terms of the…

116
00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:23.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: deciding the dates, but then we specifically, explicitly, like, use the old mechanism for…

117
00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:29.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: To say, basically, only after the last testnet do we have client releases, or would that not make sense?

118
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:53.910
stokes: Yeah, I think that could make sense. I don't see what it's going to change today, so then perhaps we just take this discussion async to the PR, and we can cover it next week's call.

119
00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:56.540
stokes: After people have chimed in there.

120
00:18:57.980 --> 00:18:59.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that sounds good to me.

121
00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:03.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any last comments on it right now, or…

122
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:04.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: Ready to move on?

123
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:11.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, I mean, the chat remains open.

124
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:25.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Then, I think we are ready to move to, Glamstadam. Before we get into the entire EAP side of things, I just wanted to briefly check, is there any specific DevNet updates, anything that…

125
00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:30.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: Happened, recently that people wanted to briefly talk about?

126
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, sorry, when I said definite, more like work towards definites, that's, I should have been a bit more precise.

127
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:51.719
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, no problem. Alright.

128
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, yeah.

129
00:19:55.880 --> 00:20:01.930
Barnabas: We have, local access list, crypto assist that's running locally, and,

130
00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:04.560
Barnabas: We are still iterating towards the…

131
00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:14.139
Barnabas: a staple DevNet. Hopefully, maybe tomorrow or early next week, we can launch, local access list DevNet Zero.

132
00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:24.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. That's very exciting. Good.

133
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:28.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then… see, that's good context for us to go into.

134
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.089
Ansgar Dietrichs: Into the governance discussions, that there's already real nice progress.

135
00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:41.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Alex, you had a comment on the issue. We discussed over the last week the process for

136
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: From now onwards, now that we're getting close to the…

137
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:48.829
Ansgar Dietrichs: To the proposal deadline, how we want to go about

138
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.349
Ansgar Dietrichs: the non-headliner EAP discussions. Do you want to summarize that?

139
00:20:54.030 --> 00:21:03.579
stokes: Sure, yeah. So, yeah, I mean, I think this is our first time through this headliner process, and I think this transition wasn't exactly as concrete as it could be, so…

140
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.469
stokes: To that end, just giving, like, an actual sort of schedule here,

141
00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.289
stokes: Yeah, again, like Ansgar was saying, it seems like we can go ahead and start thinking about Amsterdam, not headliners.

142
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:25.380
stokes: And the sort of next milestone we had set is, you know, once we had agreed to Mainnet, then we'd have one week after as a deadline for proposals.

143
00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:27.040
stokes: And…

144
00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:36.679
stokes: again, it sounds like we'll confirm, quote, officially, these dates next call, but I think we're at a place where we can go ahead and do that. And again, that being…

145
00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:48.590
stokes: Saying any non-headliner EIPs need to have been proposed for Amsterdam, with deadline one week from today. So, consider this your one-week call to do that.

146
00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.290
stokes: There's already actually…

147
00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:53.310
Ben Adams: I have a concern on that.

148
00:21:53.410 --> 00:22:04.609
Ben Adams: deadline, just due to the… due to the process of EIPs, so they have to go through the… is it the EIP office editing hours, if it's a new EIP?

149
00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:07.870
Ben Adams: And next week is…

150
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:18.579
Ben Adams: ERCs and the week after is EIPs. If anybody wants to propose a new EIP, they're unlikely to get it in. Now, they're unlikely to get it in by next week deadline.

151
00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:22.940
stokes: Fusion.

152
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:40.880
Pooja Ranjan: I just want to add a small point here. Next week is not ERC only, it is EIP plus ERC. We generally try to keep ERC one alternate week, but EIPs are all the weeks, so if there is anything, we can definitely add it on the agenda, and we can get it merged.

153
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.460
stokes: Okay, this was news to me, so…

154
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:55.329
stokes: Okay, you're saying you have to go to the EIP editing office hours call to get an EIP arched? A new one?

155
00:22:55.330 --> 00:23:00.780
Ben Adams: No, no, it's just… it's just the schedule on getting new ones merged isn't…

156
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:05.619
Ben Adams: I think, like, a two-week deadline would be… would be better.

157
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:08.880
Ben Adams: From now, since that date is forward.

158
00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:15.600
stokes: Okay, I don't really see the link there.

159
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:18.380
stokes: People not propose, and then…

160
00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:28.580
Ben Adams: Yeah, but… you can't… you need the EIP numb numbered and merged, and then put in the proposal EIP.

161
00:23:28.910 --> 00:23:30.719
Ben Adams: There's, like, it's…

162
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:38.530
stokes: Right, but I guess you're saying that they only hand out numbers if you show up to this call? That's the part I wasn't aware of.

163
00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:45.200
Ben Adams: No, no, I'm saying if you… if you're trying to, yeah, what I'm saying is it's not… it's not instant. If you…

164
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.139
Ben Adams: EIP in today.

165
00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:57.480
Ben Adams: You know, you won't necessarily… Be able to have it merged and in… The matter… EIP.

166
00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:00.339
Ben Adams: By… next week.

167
00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:09.590
stokes: Okay.

168
00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:17.349
stokes: Yeah, I guess I'm kind of wondering about this, and would echo Barnabas here in the chat, like.

169
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:22.190
stokes: I think we can assign numbers as soon as there's a PR, and then…

170
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.330
stokes: even if that PR is not merged, you could make yet another PR that puts the number into the meta-EIP.

171
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:38.449
Pooja Ranjan: I… if I'm… I'm sorry, Anskar, your hand is there, so if you want to…

172
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:43.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I just wanted to briefly, say that I think we should also be…

173
00:24:44.350 --> 00:25:07.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: to me, the deadline is really more about basically signaling your, the proposal intent, so if someone basically gets, like, if they don't yet have a number signed, or they have a number signed, but they don't figure out how to do the PR against the meta EIP before the other one is merged, or whatever, and they end up just commenting on the… on next week's ACDC issue with the intent to propose the EIP,

174
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:16.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: anything like this, I think as long as it's clear that an ERP is proposed, basically by a week from now, I personally would not

175
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mind counting that against the deadline.

176
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.790
Ansgar Dietrichs: Given that it's a bit of a… Yeah, more symbolic.

177
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:24.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: Point in time, anyway.

178
00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:26.770
Ben Adams: Yeah, okay, that's… that's fine.

179
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.740
Pooja Ranjan: That's very helpful.

180
00:25:28.740 --> 00:25:29.500
stokes: Yeah.

181
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:53.850
Pooja Ranjan: I would echo with Emska here, but generally, speaking, getting back to Ben Adams' point, I think it would be a good idea to give a two weeks timeline for any new author to propose anything, like, at least getting the PR merged, as in draft format, but, as it is also mentioned in the chat, generally speaking, we get the number almost the same day, and we can use that number, we can use that number against the meta-EIP as well.

182
00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:56.040
Pooja Ranjan: We can perhaps update it later on.

183
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.199
stokes: Okay, so then I'll amend this to say, yeah, like, even…

184
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:16.690
stokes: just a PR to the IP repo would count, and we can sort out the governance stuff, you know, in parallel, if we need to.

185
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.310
stokes: But I would prefer to keep things moving here, just…

186
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:25.360
stokes: to keep, yeah, keep things moving. Otherwise, yeah, it'll just spill out further in time.

187
00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:31.469
stokes: And, you know, one reason why is the next point, which is that,

188
00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:36.520
stokes: yeah, because of this, then we can move to, you know, discussing the different EIPs.

189
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:44.309
stokes: There are a large number of ELEAPs to go through, so we'll need to reason about that.

190
00:26:44.490 --> 00:26:53.040
stokes: There's fewer on the CL side, so it should be easier, but, towards that end, I think having…

191
00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:58.060
stokes: Some sort of document of clients and opinions, like we've done in the past, would be really useful.

192
00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:13.949
stokes: And even if it's, like, higher level, like, you know, I don't know if people are gonna necessarily have a view on every last EIP, but even, like, directionally with themes would be good, and I think that will help, you know, us here, as we go over the next couple calls, sort through all the different EIPs.

193
00:27:14.650 --> 00:27:25.009
stokes: I would propose, then, that clients try to get such lists out by, like, November 6th, and then I think that's an ACDE date. Let me just double check.

194
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:29.739
stokes: Yes, it is. So…

195
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.239
stokes: having that ready, and then that basically gives us the rest of November to go ahead and sort through everything.

196
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:39.389
stokes: Then we can finalize the Glamster Dam scope, by November.

197
00:27:47.610 --> 00:28:00.709
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right, and just to give a little bit of context for this, because if someone hasn't checked, if some of you haven't checked the PFI list for a while, we have currently… well, it's a bit in flux, and we'll hopefully be able to, later on this call, to remove

198
00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:07.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: up to 2 EIPs from it, but we are roughly 30… at 30 proposed EAPs.

199
00:28:07.470 --> 00:28:11.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: Out of those 30, it's exactly 2 C outside EIPs.

200
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:23.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: Plus you can count fossil, but fossil is already CFI'd, so… so we have three CL-side ERPs. There might be one more coming, I heard. But basically, then we have

201
00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:33.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: 27, 28, outside EAPs, so the, it… there's, like, a very big asymmetry, also in terms of the… the amount of work to just…

202
00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:49.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: go through for client teams, and even as Alex was saying, even if, say, a full-on EIP by EIP, yes-no opinion is, I think, not really necessary for the first round of…

203
00:28:50.230 --> 00:29:08.549
Ansgar Dietrichs: documents with opinions, but even just in terms of having ideas of, like, what themes, what rough scoping, these kind of things, it will be more effort for ELDF, so I think you should be aware of that when we discuss timelines.

204
00:29:09.050 --> 00:29:16.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: That said, yeah, what do people think about Alex's idea to basically have, a first round of

205
00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:23.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: People going over the EPs, forming opinions, communicating them over the next two weeks.

206
00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:25.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does that sound realistic?

207
00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:38.809
Łukasz Rozmej: Well, it sounds a bit aggressive if there are 20 ATIPs, but we'll see what we can do.

208
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:53.509
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, I'm kind of thinking the same thing. Feels a little tight, I think one more week would be totally doable, but I don't super strongly hold that opinion.

209
00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:15.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Alex and I were going back and forth about this as well. Obviously, the problem is that, these documents really only make sense for an ACDE, so then the question would be 2 weeks, or then otherwise 4 weeks, really.

210
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:22.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: And 4 weeks gets us basically exactly to the, to the ACDE that is right during DEF CON.

211
00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:29.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: I don't think we've decided yet whether we'll skip that ACD or not, but either way, it doesn't feel like an ideal.

212
00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:46.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: point either, and then otherwise, we only really, have time towards the end of the year, so it feels like it would be really, really nice if we could make two weeks from now happen, even if, again, like, I think given the number of EIPs, we… it would be understood that it's much more of a coarse view of

213
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: Like, just some basis for discussion, that people basically come into it with some clear idea, at least, of

214
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:59.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: how they feel about the general list. Not so much, like, a super detailed opinion, ERP by ERP.

215
00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:19.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: But also, we do need to make realistic plans. So the question is, like, yeah, do people think that even if not ideal, that can work, or is it just unrealistic in two weeks?

216
00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:32.440
Łukasz Rozmej: I think it can, we just need to schedule it, and yeah.

217
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:35.469
Łukasz Rozmej: So, hopefully, yes.

218
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:53.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, anyone that really hates this? Otherwise, I do think we should probably look in that approach.

219
00:32:06.370 --> 00:32:13.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, Alex, I think then we can say we continue with that, and we say that,

220
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:28.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: for… can you maybe clarify also, Alex, for the two weeks from now? Is that just for the EL client devs? How does that… I mean, again, the CL side is much more comfortable, but how would that map to the CL side?

221
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:37.030
stokes: Yeah, I mean, if… if client… if, like, a CL client team finds it useful, then, you know, by all means, I think that would be good.

222
00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:41.149
stokes: But yeah, there's really only, yeah, like, 3 or so.

223
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.150
stokes: CLEIPs, so I feel like we could probably just cover them in turn.

224
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:57.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, then… so then we just make… specifically make it a process point for the EL site. So, then…

225
00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:02.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: I'll also try to do some shepherding, reach out to you all.

226
00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:12.129
Ansgar Dietrichs: I also had a plan separately to, to, maybe with a few colleagues from the research side, have a few thoughts, published.

227
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:29.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: I just didn't want to do it before this call, because obviously there's always this tension between me as a coordinator and me also sometimes having opinions, so if you see opinions of mine over the next week or so, make sure that that, yeah, that treat them as just, like, as a researcher opinion or not a coordinator opinion.

228
00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:41.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, then let's… let's lock in the process, and so on ACDE, in two weeks, we will, hopefully have at least some general, like, documents from… from… from each

229
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:50.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yale client with, with, with, a take on how we should go about these, PFI ERPs?

230
00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.909
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then we can kind of dive into the details there.

231
00:33:58.060 --> 00:33:59.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: Lucas?

232
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:02.710
Łukasz Rozmej: Could we also give opinion on CFI TIPs?

233
00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:10.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: So you're asking specifically about fossil there? I think that's the only CFI DRP that we have?

234
00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:17.479
Łukasz Rozmej: Oh, okay. Yeah, sure, so… Yeah, because, like…

235
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:25.559
Łukasz Rozmej: You know, we can weigh which ones we want more or less, right? So fossils should also be on this list where…

236
00:34:27.719 --> 00:34:34.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that's a good clarification. I do think, yeah, I would include fossil in the scope.

237
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:36.809
Ansgar Dietrichs: That makes sense.

238
00:34:38.839 --> 00:34:49.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: It is, of course, primarily, I think, implementation overhead-wise, as seal-heavy, but I think governance side, it makes sense to have it covered on both.

239
00:35:11.739 --> 00:35:16.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: I'm trying to also follow along with chat.

240
00:35:17.089 --> 00:35:25.389
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think… I guess there is a suggestion of whether we can repurpose out of the order, basically, like, one…

241
00:35:25.539 --> 00:35:34.369
Ansgar Dietrichs: CL site call, ACDC for some EL… Work, basically.

242
00:35:34.509 --> 00:35:35.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does anyone want to…

243
00:35:35.969 --> 00:35:38.059
Ansgar Dietrichs: Briefly talk about that idea?

244
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:44.620
Barnabas: So instead of waiting just…

245
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:58.169
Barnabas: for nothing, we should probably just go through all the EL EIPs, in an ACDC call, or just rename that one call to ACDE, so that we can have all the EL devs show up as well.

246
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:13.119
Ansgar Dietrichs: That seems reasonable, and would that be then… I assume that wouldn't really make sense for next week already, because, I mean, A, that would be a bit short notice, and B, that would be before even that initial deadline, so is that more maybe for the one in three weeks, then?

247
00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: M.

248
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:17.980
stokes: I also think we should get through all the CL stuff first, like…

249
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:26.300
stokes: if we happen to, you know, get through all the seal stuff, and it's good, then yeah, if there's, like, if it makes sense, we could…

250
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:27.980
stokes: Swap one of the calls.

251
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:34.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then you're saying this is better discussed on an ACDC call, if it…

252
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.349
stokes: Well, I think more just we might need a little more time, like…

253
00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:43.529
stokes: I think it's just a, yeah, one or two calls early to say we're gonna need that.

254
00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:50.119
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so, Ben, let's bench this for now, maybe? Oh, Ben, do you have a comment on this?

255
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:58.209
Ben Adams: Yeah, we often have extra time in ACDT also. I mean, we could maybe use that as well.

256
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:04.409
Ben Adams: Just gives us… That's a large volume.

257
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:20.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. So then, but do we all agree that that's all more for, like, basically after that initial two-week period, or would, basically, does someone want to basically try to, like, allocate some specific time, ACD-related time, over the next two weeks already for some specific discussion?

258
00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.159
Łukasz Rozmej: I would say after.

259
00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:33.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, it's a good idea, and we can already, like, explore basically what kind of the…

260
00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:36.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: We have there, but yeah, let's then discuss in two weeks.

261
00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.240
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any kind of extra, opportunities for discussion.

262
00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:57.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is there… I also saw in chat the question, basically, for any EIP champions that have ERPs proposed, is there anything they can do, basically, like, over the next two weeks to make the ERP maximally legible, to basically make it easier for people as they go through the list to understand

263
00:37:57.880 --> 00:38:00.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: kind of the positioning of the EIP.

264
00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anything like that?

265
00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:28.030
stokes: this might be a little tangential, but I just, want to call out Marius's comment here in the chat. Essentially having, like, a DFI section on a client team list would be very helpful.

266
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:35.900
stokes: Just, you know, if there's things we know we don't want, then we can just acknowledge that and hopefully cut down the list.

267
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:37.410
stokes: Pretty quickly.

268
00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:54.519
Justin Florentine (Besu): Real quick question. How complete is our list of champions for the EIPs? That would be a great way for folks to reach out and come to this meeting with specific questions that they have on each one. Is that…

269
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:57.559
Justin Florentine (Besu): Gonna be good to go and useful for people?

270
00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.500
Justin Florentine (Besu): Almost fully complete. Yes, Josh, thank you.

271
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:15.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Josh, I think my understanding is that the one ERP that's missing a champion, we also have that on the agenda for today, right? I think that might actually get removed anyway, unless you're talking about a different one.

272
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:22.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, perfect.

273
00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:31.849
Ansgar Dietrichs: Justin, did you mean that we should have encouraged the ERP champions to specifically all show up in two weeks, or was that not what you were trying to say?

274
00:39:31.850 --> 00:39:34.360
Justin Florentine (Besu): what I was trying to say was that,

275
00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:45.420
Justin Florentine (Besu): the AIP champions and being able to contact them is a key part of the pre-work, so that we can limit the discussion to specific questions that folks have for each EIP.

276
00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:59.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah, so basically, like, just, this is… this is a call to all the EAP champions. Please make sure you are very available over the next two weeks, if you want to give your EAP the maximal chances, people might specifically have questions.

277
00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: I might try to reach out to you, make that as easy for people as possible.

278
00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:30.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, Alex, other than the specific, kind of, two weeks from now, documents, process, was there any other specific.

279
00:40:31.510 --> 00:40:38.589
Ansgar Dietrichs: like, proposed action item from your process overview? Or would we just then take everything else as we go?

280
00:40:40.770 --> 00:40:44.330
stokes: I think that's it, yeah. I mean, again, I just… the…

281
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:49.760
stokes: core constraint, let's say, is I would like just to have this settled by the end of next month.

282
00:40:50.590 --> 00:41:03.120
stokes: And yeah, I think, having, you know, written views as soon as possible will help people make progress, throughout the next month, and definitely, yeah, you know.

283
00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:09.830
stokes: we are, quote, twiddling our thumbs on the CL side, we can offer some time to keep the discussion going.

284
00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:18.029
stokes: So yeah, we'll see how it goes. I mean, hopefully it's pretty streamlined, and yeah, we won't need to…

285
00:41:18.300 --> 00:41:20.580
stokes: Make that many adjustments, but yeah.

286
00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:24.269
stokes: Otherwise, let's take it as we go.

287
00:41:25.770 --> 00:41:44.529
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And then one more comment from my side there, it would also be nice, given that the ACDE in two weeks, again, is, like, right in the middle of the DEFCON week, if maybe people make sure that they internally discuss with their team, so that, like, on next ACDE, we can talk about what we do with that call, do we keep it, do we…

288
00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:52.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: remove it. Obviously, that would then, also inform the general discussion of whether we can find some alternative, kind of.

289
00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:59.860
Ansgar Dietrichs: call opportunities, for… for ERP discussion, yeah, I think that would be… Very useful.

290
00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:18.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, with that, any… anyone else that… I mean, I see there's an active chat discussion, I'm sure there's going to be a lot of offline discussion as well. Is there anything, still on this… around this general process question that… that we should synchronously discuss now?

291
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:37.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then I think we can go… to some…

292
00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:51.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: more general EIP, glam system EIP housekeeping. We might have the list grow or shrink a bit more over the next few minutes, so let's all hope for the best, hope for more EIPs being removed than added.

293
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:58.189
Ansgar Dietrichs: But with that, Maria, you had two repricing-related topics you wanted to touch on?

294
00:43:00.630 --> 00:43:10.859
Maria Silva: So the first one is a quick one. So, on, following this discussion, I, I posted here on…

295
00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:30.890
Maria Silva: on the issue, a proposal for adding to breakout calls, to discuss repricing EIPs. So, of the 31 EIPs, a lot of them are repricings, and they have some, technical details that are not just,

296
00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:34.139
Maria Silva: changing parameters, some are simply

297
00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:53.470
Maria Silva: changing some… some numbers, but there are others that are more… have more, depth, let's say. And so I think it would be useful to have, two additional breakouts where we kind of deep dive on all the EIPs. We discuss

298
00:43:53.620 --> 00:44:01.210
Maria Silva: potential issues, and then, we can have some sort of, early…

299
00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:10.670
Maria Silva: signaling on prioritization and understanding if things make sense. And the proposal would be to have it on Wednesday.

300
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:16.219
Maria Silva: At 3 UTC, so we do next Wednesday, and then the Wednesday after.

301
00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:30.920
Maria Silva: And then after that, we can, come to ACDE, with an overview of key takeaways from that. So yeah, so I'm proposing it. I think it would be useful, but I want to know if

302
00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:43.189
Maria Silva: folks that are interested in these find it useful, because if we're gonna have attendance in those breakout rooms, they are not as interesting. So yeah, just putting it out, to see if

303
00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.880
Maria Silva: false, it's… it's… It's useful.

304
00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:13.180
Ben Adams: Yeah, yeah, I think, I think it's quite important because there are so many different…

305
00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.730
Ben Adams: repricing EIPs that we really need to…

306
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:20.419
Ben Adams: holistic view of them all together. I think it would be…

307
00:45:20.730 --> 00:45:23.400
Ben Adams: Very valuable to have the breakouts.

308
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:25.020
Ben Adams: Beforehand.

309
00:45:28.330 --> 00:45:37.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I mean, I'm obviously biased on this topic, I'm somewhat involved with a lot of this repricing work myself. Yeah, I do think that given that that's much more…

310
00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:49.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: Clustered, at least. There's a lot of interconnections. Yeah, I do think this would be very, very helpful. Do people, as Maria said, the idea would be to basically use both?

311
00:45:49.010 --> 00:46:03.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: next Wednesdays. Does that work for people? I think it's enough, like, there's… there's more than 10 ERPs that at least are related to repricing, so… so I think there's really a lot to go through. It would be a bit rushed to try to do this in a single call.

312
00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:08.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does that work for people, or is it… it's basically too… too much to ask?

313
00:46:18.990 --> 00:46:20.130
Ben Adams: Works for me.

314
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:24.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so… Yeah, Maria, sounds like…

315
00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:26.420
Maria Silva: Yeah, yeah, seems like…

316
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:34.140
Maria Silva: Some people are interested, there are no clear, cons or timings that don't work, so…

317
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:49.129
Maria Silva: Perry, you are asking, do we expect community members in these repricing calls or not? I would say, I think these calls should be open to anyone, but I understand that

318
00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:56.319
Maria Silva: People that will show will be mostly car dives, but yeah, The page captains as well.

319
00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:15.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I would say, maybe a clarification question, Maria, right? My assumption would be that it would be… like, the focus would be more a technical… the technical side, and, like, going through that, and answering people's questions, but maybe less so the specific governance conversation, or, like, the…

320
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:18.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, or do you have a different…

321
00:47:18.620 --> 00:47:25.969
Maria Silva: No, no, no, no, no, no, exactly. It's mostly about, like, understanding the EIPs and doing more technical deep dives on it.

322
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:31.680
Maria Silva: Of course, the governance discussion will be on ACD.

323
00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:38.130
Ben Adams: And I assume a little bit will be… Trying to…

324
00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:43.600
Ben Adams: Smooth over any rough edges so that the IPs are… Consistent with each other.

325
00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:44.850
Maria Silva: Bye.

326
00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:59.329
Maria Silva: Okay, so I think maybe we can move to the next topic. So, Asgar, I'm not sure what the process is, but we can figure it out. I think, we will schedule these breakout calls.

327
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:07.000
Maria Silva: Cool. So the next topic I wanted, so I'll just quickly share my screen.

328
00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:09.110
Maria Silva: for this one.

329
00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:15.609
Maria Silva: So I wanted to talk about,

330
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:20.880
Maria Silva: Browning errors, and why this is important for repricings.

331
00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.250
Maria Silva: So… First, what is…

332
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:40.530
Maria Silva: what is the problem here? So the… the problem is, essentially, the compute upcodes are way too efficient when compared to the other operations and the current gas price.

333
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:47.159
Maria Silva: So this means that with integer gas, we cannot make them cheap enough.

334
00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:57.379
Maria Silva: To actually have the right balance of difference in pricing between the really efficient offloads and the remaining uploads.

335
00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.069
Maria Silva: And so… This means that, at the moment, even if we do a repricing.

336
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:23.809
Maria Silva: without doing anything else, we will have rounding errors. And what do I mean by a rounding error? So imagine that an operation… so we do the benchmarking, we find a certain anchor, so it could be, for instance, ECUB Cover or something like this, and we say that an operation should cost 0.8.

337
00:49:23.850 --> 00:49:30.499
Maria Silva: But because we cannot have, fractional gas, we have to round it up to 1.

338
00:49:30.860 --> 00:49:32.820
Maria Silva: And so this means that

339
00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:44.019
Maria Silva: for that operation, we incur a 20% error due to routing. So this means that we could fit 20 more of this operation, if we were not running it.

340
00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:53.669
Maria Silva: And, you can see here, so here I'm just, plotting the average rounding error for compute operations.

341
00:49:53.790 --> 00:50:09.120
Maria Silva: Assuming different anchors, and so here, anchors, I'm using the milligars per second metric, so you kind of, use these, and then you assume a block execution time of 2 seconds, you derive the block limit, and you can do then the anchoring based on that.

342
00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:20.830
Maria Silva: And you can see here that with, the performances that we have right now, so it's around the,

343
00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:39.460
Maria Silva: the 30 to 50 milligars per second. We do have a lot of running errors on average, and then only after the 500 milligars per second anchor, which is an order of magnitudes larger than what we have right now, is when we actually start to have

344
00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.339
Maria Silva: Low grounding errors.

345
00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:50.700
Maria Silva: And if we look at transaction levels, so here I just took a sample of a thousand blocks.

346
00:50:50.770 --> 00:51:09.739
Maria Silva: And I saw how many of each opcodes were executed in those blocks, and I assumed the repricing based on the Aztec's empirical analysis, so the analysis for the EIP704, and then I did the reprice, assuming 50 milligars per second.

347
00:51:09.780 --> 00:51:18.590
Maria Silva: Anchor, and essentially you can see the level of errors that we get on an average block, so this would be around 4%.

348
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:28.960
Maria Silva: And so, this is the problem. Now, I think we have two solutions, and I will just give, like, a quick overview of them.

349
00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.810
Maria Silva: So, one option is we just do a rebase, so we can…

350
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:40.609
Maria Silva: go to all GAS variables and parameters, and just scale them by a factor of a thousand.

351
00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:53.669
Maria Silva: Block limits and targets move from billion of units to… to… from million to billion, and gas costs move from units to thousands. And so this allows us, then, on the compute side.

352
00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:59.980
Maria Silva: To actually make them much more cheaper while still having integer Gus.

353
00:52:02.590 --> 00:52:14.619
Maria Silva: Or we can do fractional gas. So, there was an old EIP called particle gas, so DIP would be similar, so we add a new counter, it could be milli gas.

354
00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:25.690
Maria Silva: And then all… everything inside the EVM execution of the transaction is, accounted in Milligas, and then we do a rounding at the end of the transaction, so…

355
00:52:25.690 --> 00:52:39.510
Maria Silva: During transaction execution, you use this new counter. After transaction execution, you round up, and then transaction fee, transaction GAS limits, block limits, and everything is going back to the normal gas.

356
00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:42.199
Maria Silva: So these are the two…

357
00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:59.410
Maria Silva: solution, so both have pros and cons. So, on fractional gas, you are essentially adding some, complexity to the EVM, so we are adding a new variable, and we are adding this, mechanism of running a transaction level.

358
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:11.569
Maria Silva: But the gas rebate, will likely impact UX, so this is kind of, first a hammer on hard-coated valleys, so we may be breaking stuff.

359
00:53:11.810 --> 00:53:17.120
Maria Silva: And also, it… So this, this point can be…

360
00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:20.000
Maria Silva: debatable. It's like, how much of a…

361
00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:33.999
Maria Silva: different experience this is, because users mostly have the gas estimation with their wallets, and devs, maybe they can adjust, but essentially, it's like the concept of gas and gas limit will change.

362
00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:36.740
Maria Silva: And this, this could have an impact.

363
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:42.850
Maria Silva: So I know this was very fast, so I just wanted to have…

364
00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:51.149
Maria Silva: To, to put these in your attention, and also to ask if there's, like, Any solution that

365
00:53:51.270 --> 00:54:00.420
Maria Silva: seems to be clearly better than the other, and the reason I'm asking is, I already have drafted initial EIPs for both solutions.

366
00:54:00.530 --> 00:54:13.559
Maria Silva: And I can propose them both for Glamsterdam, and then have this discussion, during the governance process, or if there's already a clear solution, I can just,

367
00:54:13.770 --> 00:54:21.379
Maria Silva: Proposed one of them, and then we can discuss if it makes sense to include it or not, instead of having to,

368
00:54:21.580 --> 00:54:36.100
Maria Silva: So yeah, if there are any comments, I will open the floor now. Also, I will share the link after you have here the references for the analysis, for the… for the… the compute repricing, and also for the apps that I…

369
00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:37.959
Maria Silva: We're selling robots.

370
00:54:43.810 --> 00:54:48.659
Maria Silva: Okay, I'm trying to follow now the shots.

371
00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.489
Maria Silva: Yeah, but please just jump in if you have any comments.

372
00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:57.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: Andrew?

373
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:11.140
Andrew Ashikhmin: Well, I think it's an unnecessary complication, because there is a lot of variability in the actual costs, like which architecture you run on.

374
00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:18.970
Andrew Ashikhmin: which is the underlying libraries, like numerical libraries, you use for computationally heavy stuff. How…

375
00:55:18.970 --> 00:55:34.739
Andrew Ashikhmin: like, whether you use, like, for things like storage versus CPU, it depends a lot on various data structures, hashes, and, like, whether… like, whether you use an NVMe or not, so it's like, there is so much…

376
00:55:34.970 --> 00:55:43.950
Andrew Ashikhmin: variability that, to my mind, it's the… it's kind of… the… the uncertainty

377
00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:54.239
Andrew Ashikhmin: In the actual cost is just too big to justify such fine-grain

378
00:55:54.470 --> 00:56:09.470
Andrew Ashikhmin: adjustments, and we are, to my… like, I see it as we are trying to, like, this is a micro-optimization… an unnecessary micro-optimization, so we have much, much bigger fish to fry. If we…

379
00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:18.629
Andrew Ashikhmin: adjust the, like, do the, like, first, like, we should move step by step, first things first, like, let's do the first order.

380
00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:30.299
Andrew Ashikhmin: pricing readjustment, which aligns better with the actual cost, but my point is, like, maybe the second order is just infeasible, because, yeah, like, you…

381
00:56:30.730 --> 00:56:37.359
Andrew Ashikhmin: The real costs will vary a lot depending on the architecture, the hardware, and the software.

382
00:56:44.730 --> 00:56:47.060
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mario, do you have.

383
00:56:47.810 --> 00:56:57.439
Maria Silva: Right, so I, I think… so your comment, you are not necessarily referring one solution or the other, you are just saying none of the solutions.

384
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:04.690
Andrew Ashikhmin: Correct. I think it's, at this point at least, none of, like, none of the solutions are necessary.

385
00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:08.340
Maria Silva: Right. So I, I think to…

386
00:57:09.150 --> 00:57:13.879
Maria Silva: To me, that discussion is something we can… we can have,

387
00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:23.060
Maria Silva: at some… at some point, and I think it makes sense to have, based on all the other EIPs that we have.

388
00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:32.799
Maria Silva: But yeah, I think I would like to focus more on just the difference between the two possibilities, and whether there's a clear

389
00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:36.119
Maria Silva: One that is better than the other.

390
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:39.499
Maria Silva: But yeah, thank you, thank you.

391
00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:42.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then Carl, next up?

392
00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:50.290
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, thanks. A few things, yeah. Addressing some of the points raised, previously, the…

393
00:57:50.780 --> 00:58:02.500
Carl Beekhuizen: like, we always use the worst-case client. So, like, sure, there's variability between clients, and even the benchmarks only have a limited resolution, but we always use the worst-case client for a benchmark.

394
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:05.760
Carl Beekhuizen: And so, like, that is our constraint.

395
00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.499
Carl Beekhuizen: I kind of disagree if we're, like, have a…

396
00:58:09.610 --> 00:58:17.940
Carl Beekhuizen: like, average rounding errors or something of… or, like, if we have rounding, that's, like, 20% off, like, that's 20% scale we're just leaving in one dimension on the table.

397
00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.409
Carl Beekhuizen: Obviously, that'll vary per opcode, but…

398
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.840
Carl Beekhuizen: I think this is, like, some kind of optimization we can achieve there. The second thing is that…

399
00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:36.310
Carl Beekhuizen: In effect, we are rebasing anyway. Like, every single opcode, we're just proposing changing the pricing here.

400
00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:45.559
Carl Beekhuizen: So all rebasing is, like, the rebasing idea here is doing is just being like, okay, cool, but we're gonna change, like, agree to change everything by a slightly bigger…

401
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:50.220
Carl Beekhuizen: Factor than we intended to. And we can, like…

402
00:58:51.300 --> 00:59:03.320
Carl Beekhuizen: debate how big that needs to be, right? The proposed rebase here was 1,000, but even if we do a rebase of, like, scale everything by 10x, then something that was, like, a 20% error is now a 2% error. That's a very big difference.

403
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:06.609
Carl Beekhuizen: So yeah, I think there's… there are many things we can do here to achieve

404
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.009
Carl Beekhuizen: some of these things here. I'm personally not a huge fan of…

405
00:59:11.310 --> 00:59:15.550
Carl Beekhuizen: Doing particle gas, I think it's just, like, massive complexity here.

406
00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:19.479
Carl Beekhuizen: But, like, within the EVM, and, and risks of…

407
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:38.119
Carl Beekhuizen: Having, consensus errors, but, that's open for debate. The second thing that, LightClient was raising is, like, concerns about breaking existing contracts. So I've been running some experiments, and in all the transactions, we have

408
00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:40.570
Carl Beekhuizen: ever.

409
00:59:40.690 --> 00:59:53.010
Carl Beekhuizen: like, changing, rebasing 1000X. There are 1,000 transactions that would fail, that would have previously succeeded, and 1,300 transactions that have a different state route at the end.

410
00:59:53.460 --> 00:59:54.760
Carl Beekhuizen: So, in effect.

411
00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.349
Carl Beekhuizen: Like, basically none of the transactions change or run into new errors or that kind of thing.

412
01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.169
Carl Beekhuizen: So it seems to be, like, very marginal effects to, like, actual…

413
01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:11.710
Carl Beekhuizen: EVM users and transactions, so I don't think that should be a major thing that's holding us back right now.

414
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:28.739
Carl Beekhuizen: I think the bigger things you're gonna see is, like, what happens on, like, when we, like, to existing, like, tooling and that kind of thing outside of the EVM, and wallets, as opposed to, like, how does it break contracts within the EVM? It seems like people have been pretty good about not hard-coding too much.

415
01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.699
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, gas constants, etc.

416
01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:42.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: Ben?

417
01:00:43.630 --> 01:00:47.199
Ben Adams: I mean, with… with rebasing externally.

418
01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.530
Ben Adams: You have a problem that… plants…

419
01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:54.960
Ben Adams: Because we were all too slow to move our defaults, they've…

420
01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.449
Ben Adams: Set what the block gas limit is, and…

421
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:07.759
Ben Adams: So we… we don't control what the validators do, so we'd have to coordinate everybody to also rebase up, unless we reinterpret the values.

422
01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:13.359
Ben Adams: Then you've got, yeah, wallets and so forth. There's a lot of UX.

423
01:01:14.090 --> 01:01:15.309
Ben Adams: On the upper end.

424
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:22.540
Ben Adams: Coupled with that, smart contracts that do, you know, gas left and all that sort of stuff.

425
01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:26.540
Ben Adams: Or pass explicit gas in coal.

426
01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:28.220
Ben Adams: Upgrades.

427
01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:37.679
Ben Adams: Whereas we could do… in… we could do… I mean, at particle gas, we'd ascent… we wouldn't introduce floating-point numbers, we'd just…

428
01:01:37.950 --> 01:01:46.429
Ben Adams: Internally rebased, so… in the EVM, we'd rebate everything up, and then when it was red, we'd just…

429
01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.730
Ben Adams: Rebase it back down one more.

430
01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.219
Ben Adams: You know, when there's any introspection.

431
01:01:51.660 --> 01:01:53.130
Ben Adams: Or at the end of the contract.

432
01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:58.559
Ben Adams: So, we sort of did both, so…

433
01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:05.710
Ben Adams: So the gas didn't change, but internally, when we're processing it, we assume everything's 10 times bigger, or 100 times bigger.

434
01:02:07.470 --> 01:02:08.530
Ben Adams: And that could work.

435
01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:22.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: And my understanding is that it's basically exactly… that would be… that variant you just described would be the Milligas proposal, or the… there was, I think, an old ERP in the past called Particle Gas, all kind of similar ideas. Maria, can you briefly clarify? Is that…

436
01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:22.880
Maria Silva: Yeah, yeah.

437
01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:23.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: Give me at least two.

438
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:41.239
Maria Silva: Yeah, that's… that's exactly how it works. So you have an internal counter that is still an integer, and then that would be the milligas counter, and all the op codes prices would be in milligas. The gas left accounting would be in milligas.

439
01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:48.209
Maria Silva: But then at the end of the transaction, you round up to GAD, and so you report… the EVM reports back

440
01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:57.399
Maria Silva: the gas, but not technically gas. So, everything at transaction limits, transaction fees, and so on, so forth, block limits are still

441
01:02:57.660 --> 01:02:58.860
Maria Silva: In gas.

442
01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:03.540
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, photos?

443
01:03:04.590 --> 01:03:08.160
potuz: Yeah, one thing that called my attention is that,

444
01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:14.690
potuz: A bunch of the data supporting this is based on anchoring on 2 seconds to execution.

445
01:03:15.050 --> 01:03:22.480
potuz: And this will change dramatically on Glamsterdam, and then even potentially might change even more on the age fork.

446
01:03:22.610 --> 01:03:37.779
potuz: So… so that's something to… to keep in mind, that if we are anchoring on 2 seconds execution, then Glamstering gives us 8. Perhaps the numbers we're getting are wrong, or not, just not the appropriate ones. And then again, if we shorten the slot times, then…

447
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:46.640
potuz: Well, that one might not be so dramatic if we also divide the gas limit, but again, the point stands that,

448
01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:53.050
potuz: Seems a little bit premature if we do not know what the effects of longer execution is going to be.

449
01:03:55.070 --> 01:04:07.579
Maria Silva: So I would add, the way that we are defining the anchors is on million gas per second, so you can then use that rationale to say what would be the block limit on a certain

450
01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:11.899
Maria Silva: execution time, so if you want to do 2 seconds, you can…

451
01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:21.660
Maria Silva: make the conversion by multiplying by 2. If you want to do 4 seconds, you multiply it by 4, but the anchor is on a per second, so it's kind of like…

452
01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:32.239
Maria Silva: It's… it's independent, so the only thing that then… like, if you are anchoring on a 50 million gas per second, the only thing is that if you are then

453
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:38.939
Maria Silva: Allowing for… for second execution time, you… you… you can raise the block limit by…

454
01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:43.139
Maria Silva: for a set amount. But the rounding errors shouldn't change.

455
01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:50.950
Maria Silva: Because it's on a per… so the plot I was showing is on a per transaction, was the second plot, and the first plot was on the per upload level.

456
01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:54.940
Maria Silva: Does these make sense?

457
01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:04.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, maybe this specific topic we can type to the chat. I would also…

458
01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:24.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: maybe try to timebox this discussion a little bit. We can go a few more minutes, but given that we are not yet actually talking about the governance decision of including anything, we're just talking about which variant or both to even propose. So, yeah, let's go through, like, whatever comments people still have, but then I do think we should probably…

459
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:29.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: leave some room for the other, agenda topics as well. Andrew?

460
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:46.940
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, I think what would be helpful is to, maybe it's already reported somewhere, but I would like to see the variability of the actual costs, because, as I mentioned, it depends a lot on the hardware.

461
01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:54.710
Andrew Ashikhmin: And even on the same hardware, there are some natural variability, like, during two.

462
01:05:54.890 --> 01:06:10.939
Andrew Ashikhmin: whether something is close to the CPU in caches or not, things like that. So, if you run a bunch of experiments, I would like to see the standard deviation and things like that. I think that would help us to…

463
01:06:11.180 --> 01:06:16.290
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, basically to make more… In informed decisions.

464
01:06:19.010 --> 01:06:36.730
Maria Silva: Right, so I was using the data from the ASIC's empirical analysis, I'm happy to share the link, but in the slides, there's a link to the EIP, and then the EIP is the link to the analysis. But if you can't find it, I'm happy, like, just ping me on Discord, and I will share that with you.

465
01:06:39.270 --> 01:06:45.050
Maria Silva: But we are also working on redoing some of those benchmarks, so we'll be able to make

466
01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.280
Maria Silva: more numbers, then.

467
01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.710
Maria Silva: Okay.

468
01:06:50.710 --> 01:07:05.669
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, and I would be interested in comparison of, like, like, we do have minimal hardware specs, so I would like to see results both for NVMe versus SSD, and for ARM versus AMD, at least.

469
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:15.769
Maria Silva: Yeah, if I recall correctly, ASX Analysis was doing just, one hardware spec, not multiple, but I can… I can send that to you.

470
01:07:18.190 --> 01:07:28.540
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just to mention, I do think that sounded like a general kind of repricing question, not just related to this precision question, so I think that would also be a great topic for next week's call.

471
01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:38.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: The breakout call, specifically, around, repricings, like the question of what does the… what are the benchmarking bases for the different repricing.

472
01:07:38.490 --> 01:07:39.380
Ansgar Dietrichs: Proposals.

473
01:07:39.850 --> 01:07:42.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: Carl, you have your hand up?

474
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:46.639
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, just briefly, the repricing, like…

475
01:07:47.460 --> 01:07:54.349
Carl Beekhuizen: the data that's being used here is kind of… should be treated as preliminary data, like, this is not the proposal for the final EIP.

476
01:07:54.610 --> 01:08:04.339
Carl Beekhuizen: As clients are improving, and as we get, like, much better benchmarking data, like, expect these numbers to change, and the exact things here to be reworked.

477
01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:11.620
Carl Beekhuizen: This is more just flagging what are the questions that we already know are going to come up based on what we can already see in this data.

478
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:20.760
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, all these concerns are very valid and should be brought up and, like, discussed in these other things, but, like, we're not making… the proposal here isn't to make a final decision on

479
01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.660
Carl Beekhuizen: Exactly how things are done right now.

480
01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:39.589
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. Yeah, then maybe it did sound like some people were skeptical that we need either of the three APs, and then within that, some people preferred one approach than the other.

481
01:08:40.179 --> 01:08:58.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: I don't… there doesn't seem to be that much harm in having both proposed, given that at most, one of them will make it into the fork anyway, other than to make the lives of everyone on the call that has to go through it in the next two weeks, like, slightly worse, because they have to briefly understand that these two, are basically just doing the same thing in different ways.

482
01:08:58.219 --> 01:09:01.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I feel like that's manageable, given that we just talked about it.

483
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:08.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, I don't know, like, does that mean maybe… yeah, maybe it seems like the default outcome would be to maybe propose both.

484
01:09:08.540 --> 01:09:15.910
Maria Silva: Yeah, it seems like there's no consensus, so I would just simply propose both and give you work. Sorry about that.

485
01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:19.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, yeah.

486
01:09:19.439 --> 01:09:22.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome, thank you, Marie, for that segment.

487
01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:36.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then, let's move on. The next one is, is nice, because it might just, actually reduce everyone's work a tiny amount. There are two EIPs that, I think, my understanding is, can be removed from

488
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:51.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: PFI list, but I wanted to briefly go through them. There is EIP7667. Nixo, you first, observed that, it, or at least you left the comment on the agenda that, that it,

489
01:09:51.580 --> 01:10:01.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: lacks a champion, and then also, I think Sophia just now left a comment on the agenda, saying that the ZK team also thinks that

490
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:07.389
Ansgar Dietrichs: Glamstadam is not yet the right fork for this EIP? Can… is there any, kind of, any…

491
01:10:07.770 --> 01:10:10.389
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anything to add on, like, the status of the CIP?

492
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:14.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: Or any considerations around potentially removing it from the PFI set?

493
01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:26.310
nixo: I can just say it was added to, this PFI set only because it sort of came,

494
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:39.360
nixo: in a bundle with the last, set of PFIs that were supposed to be for the vertical fork. So it really wasn't even intended to be added to this fork in a way that,

495
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:44.289
nixo: that the other PFIs were. So, it should be uncontroversial, but if anybody has any…

496
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:46.129
nixo: Reason that it should be added.

497
01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:49.570
Guillaume: Speak up now. What's the other EIP, actually, that you described?

498
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:54.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: No, I think that's true for both EAPs. Both ERPs, yeah.

499
01:10:54.190 --> 01:10:58.490
nixo: This, this EIP was originally proposed in April of 2024.

500
01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:21.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just for context for people, like, this EAP, the reason why that one… this one is at least in principle still relevant for the future, and even before any state changes, is that the idea is to make precompiles more expensive to account for the cost that it causes for ZK EVM provers.

501
01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:37.579
Ansgar Dietrichs: But, I think my understanding is that, basically, like, in general, that discussion, both on the benchmark side, on the general, like, do we even want to do this, do we want to make prices based on ZK performance, is not yet advanced enough to be relevant yet for Glamsterdam, so unless there's any specific objections, we can…

502
01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:39.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Remove it from PFI.

503
01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:58.199
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then, Guillaume already mentioned it, the other one, I think, that I came across, I think is even more clear-cut, that's 6873, which, is, I think, just a preparatory step for any kind of tree change. Like, I don't know, Guillaume, do you have any

504
01:11:58.270 --> 01:12:03.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: concrete content you already said offline that you think it would make sense to remove it from PFI?

505
01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.940
Guillaume: Yeah, it was inherited from, like, it was moved, I think, by Tim.

506
01:12:08.270 --> 01:12:20.980
Guillaume: to… to, to Fusaka or Glamsterdam. I guess it bounced to Glamsterdam after a while. We don't need it for the moment, so there's no reason to keep it on the roster.

507
01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:26.279
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. Then after this call, I'll remove both of these ERPs from PFI, and…

508
01:12:26.710 --> 01:12:31.479
Ansgar Dietrichs: We made you also stop just a tiny bit easier, so… small win.

509
01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:39.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. And thank you, Nixu, for, for, bringing this up, because, yeah, that's really good.

510
01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:49.239
Ansgar Dietrichs: M… Yeah, then we have one more agenda point, which is Carlos wanted to talk about EIP 8058.

511
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: Palace?

512
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:53.580
CPerezz: Yep, I'll share my screen.

513
01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.050
CPerezz: Hold on one sec…

514
01:13:09.330 --> 01:13:12.639
CPerezz: Okay, I need to restart soon, so just one second, apologies.

515
01:13:37.710 --> 01:13:39.120
CPerezz: Thank you, Marius.

516
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:44.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maris, can you maybe do this, like, you know, at the beginning of each stream, before we go live? That would be really nice.

517
01:13:48.810 --> 01:13:51.209
CPerezz: Okay, so you should be seeing my screen now.

518
01:13:51.590 --> 01:14:00.869
CPerezz: So yeah, I want to quickly present this EIP. Nothing really complex, so I think we can go quite fast through it.

519
01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:22.390
CPerezz: So basically, the idea is that with EIPs that are being proposed for Glamsterdam, especially the ones that reprise, state access and state growth, aggressively, some of them, like, 8037 and 8038, one of the realizations that we came up with was that,

520
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:40.470
CPerezz: Clients are basically incurring into any cost when the user deploys bytecode that is already deployed, so basically it already exists on their database, and therefore they don't know… they don't do anything. But they charge, as if they were actually duplicating the bytecode, which is not something that they do.

521
01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:59.600
CPerezz: So, the idea was to basically address this, mainly because if we get something like EIP837, the gas cost for deploying a contract will jump up significantly, and the price that users will incur for deploying contracts will be quite outrageous. So, if

522
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:06.079
CPerezz: If they aren't even incurring into any state growth, it's a bit weird to charge them that much.

523
01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:23.819
CPerezz: So, the idea of the deduplication is simple. It's based on using access lists. The why will come later, but the idea is, if you're a user and you know that this contract, is already deployed and another account, has its code hash stored.

524
01:15:23.820 --> 01:15:34.339
CPerezz: You just include this in the access list, and therefore the client, the only thing that needs to do is run the init code, hash the resulting bytecode, and see if those match.

525
01:15:34.540 --> 01:15:45.280
CPerezz: If there's a match, there's no need to actually deploy any bytecode, and therefore, the client can skip charging the gas code deposit cost to the end user.

526
01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:54.060
CPerezz: So, just to address some minimal things, if we add it within the same block,

527
01:15:54.130 --> 01:16:00.969
CPerezz: the expected behavior is that transaction A will always pay the full gas cost if the address doesn't exist.

528
01:16:00.970 --> 01:16:14.670
CPerezz: If there's another transaction which happens to include the previous one, which is quite unrealistic, but could happen, we basically treat it on this way and receive the duplication cost, too.

529
01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:26.580
CPerezz: The core trade-off here, which is what I want to basically discuss, is the following. We went for the access list-based approach, because there's two main problems. The first one is.

530
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:40.429
CPerezz: We don't want to force clients to hold a reverse mapping between code and account, which is what we will need to do if clients will be able to just look up this.

531
01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:59.770
CPerezz: So that we basically, A, reduce storage, or at least we don't make it even bigger, and B, we reduce the complexity of the AIP to the minimal. There's a second thing, which is, if you snap sync or you fullsync, the bytecodes that you will have are different.

532
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:11.880
CPerezz: Because some clients, when they full sync, they store bytecodes of reorgs, because they are basically not part of the state, technically. And so…

533
01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:24.520
CPerezz: when you snap sync, you will… you will not see an account that has the gold hash, and therefore you will never ask for this range of leads, and so you will… what we have is essentially clients having, like.

534
01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:33.310
CPerezz: in Cancun was at 27,000 difference between bytecodes that they have, or bytecodes that they don't have between each other.

535
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:38.950
CPerezz: So to avoid all of this mess, the simplest thing was to just do it via access list.

536
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:51.770
CPerezz: The problem, of course, is that if we do it on this way, at the moment, there's no clients that actually expose any RPC endpoint to actually check for cold duplication.

537
01:17:51.830 --> 01:18:00.910
CPerezz: There's external services that allow you to do that, like third parties, Etherscan, and there's some others. It's free to do so.

538
01:18:00.910 --> 01:18:14.100
CPerezz: But of course, I mean, I understand that it incurs in some UX friction. At the end, I tried to bring this topic to the wallet meeting last week.

539
01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:22.120
CPerezz: But no one showed up, so we couldn't discuss it. One of the main, things that…

540
01:18:22.290 --> 01:18:38.760
CPerezz: are against the UX burden, is that the amount of unique versus duplicated bytecodes, as you see by the study of Wei Han from the Stateless team, is that 97% of the bytecodes deployed are basically duplications.

541
01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:54.810
CPerezz: So the impact, I assume it will be minimal, because most of the things that get deployed nowadays are just mere copies of things that already exist, and most of them are pretty standardized and famous, so it's not really hard to basically find an account that holds the code hash for the contract that you want to deploy.

542
01:18:55.620 --> 01:19:03.260
CPerezz: So, basically, I think this is more or less it. There's…

543
01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:22.760
CPerezz: just… I just added this, thing so that you can basically see the difference between what you will pay and what you will not pay if we have deduplication in EIP837 for a 24 kilobyte contract. Of course, if we have 256 kilobyte contracts, this goes, like, to the moon.

544
01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:39.389
CPerezz: And yeah, next steps are just discuss this, figure out, if clients want changes, or they have questions, or whatever, and if we can include it and finalize this thing, we will implement it, at least for Geth, and yeah, that should be mostly it.

545
01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:45.190
CPerezz: So, yeah, that should be it from my side. If there's any questions or whatever, happy to answer.

546
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:54.039
Łukasz Rozmej: I have a question, is this forward compatible with code checking and putting the code into the tree?

547
01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.550
CPerezz: That's a good point.

548
01:19:58.690 --> 01:20:05.159
CPerezz: I think it should be, because the bytecode at the end is chunked always on the same way.

549
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:12.210
CPerezz: But I would defer to Guillaume, who will probably have a much more informed answer.

550
01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:18.509
Guillaume: The short answer is yes, there will be some tweaks to do, but, yes, it is.

551
01:20:20.850 --> 01:20:22.500
Łukasz Rozmej: Okay, but we need to…

552
01:20:22.670 --> 01:20:30.520
Łukasz Rozmej: Account for those tweaks, beforehand with implementing this, or will be to those… do these tweaks when we will go… get to code tranking?

553
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:46.949
Guillaume: I think it's more of a code chunking thing, but, yeah, we, I mean, okay, I can make a write-up to go over the exact issues and see if we find them. But the… from what I see, the code chunks…

554
01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:53.450
Guillaume: Would be stored exactly like code today, so there's no reason for it to… to be any different.

555
01:20:55.050 --> 01:21:01.630
Łukasz Rozmej: So, because in vertical, we wanted to put code chunks directly into the tree, right?

556
01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:15.840
Guillaume: Yeah, but code chunking in… okay, code chunking has, okay, there are two versions of code chunking. There's code chunking in 2926, which is an MPT-based thing, and this is what I was referring to when I said there's no problem.

557
01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:26.239
Guillaume: When you go into any unified tree, like the unified binary tree, or vertical trees, for that matter, we will need to change the EIP

558
01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:38.569
Guillaume: to, to actually put the code independently and not per account like it is currently specified. This is a conversation we want to have on the next, Stateless Implementers call.

559
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:56.439
Guillaume: But I think there's a lot of support for this, so in this respect, there would not be any problem either, but we need to get to the details. But once again, this is only a problem for a unified tree, and not code chunking itself.

560
01:22:02.220 --> 01:22:09.130
Ben Adams: For discovery, I see me just use, estimate guess, rather than…

561
01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:19.439
Ben Adams: You know, is this bytecode already deployed? Because that would be quite hard. You're not going to change your… subtly change your bike code to match one that already exists.

562
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:28.550
Ben Adams: But obviously, It would bring down the cost of, like, Contracts that deploy contracts with

563
01:22:28.940 --> 01:22:36.759
Ben Adams: become, you know, like Uniswap, E2, deploying liquidity pools, they would become very cheap, because that's obviously the same.

564
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:40.849
Ben Adams: Exactly the same contract, so it's deployed again and again.

565
01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:51.789
CPerezz: But that's theoretically fair, no? Meaning, the user is paying exactly for the resources that the node is consuming, so…

566
01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:52.670
Ben Adams: Yeah, yeah.

567
01:22:52.910 --> 01:23:00.570
Ben Adams: I'm… I'm… I'm not against it. And it would also, it would also encourage more… More reuse.

568
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:11.939
CPerezz: Are there any strong opinions from clients on how we should, handle,

569
01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:24.200
CPerezz: the attention of this reverse index, meaning, is it okay if we… like, the worst case is the user pays the same that he's paying nowadays, so there's not, like…

570
01:23:24.210 --> 01:23:33.960
CPerezz: there's no, like, drawback, I would say. But it's true that the way to obtain this discount at this point is mainly you need to iterate through your

571
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:45.369
CPerezz: tree, or, like, you need to know what you're doing with the node, or, you need to go to a centralized slash third-party service. So, are there any thoughts on that?

572
01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:54.250
Ben Adams: Wouldn't estimate gas. You know, the normal… what you'd do with the wallet, tell you.

573
01:23:55.810 --> 01:24:08.600
CPerezz: So Estimate Gas should be easy to do, right? Because for Estimate Gas, you already should have the access list field, so you can just check if the code exists or not.

574
01:24:09.100 --> 01:24:14.310
Ben Adams: Yeah, so… I mean, I assume that's the approach somebody would try and discover.

575
01:24:15.110 --> 01:24:19.430
Ben Adams: They're essentially saying, if I deploy this contract, how much is it going to cost me?

576
01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.570
Ben Adams: That's why you want to know if the bike code already exists, isn't it?

577
01:24:24.570 --> 01:24:25.170
CPerezz: He is.

578
01:24:25.170 --> 01:24:29.020
Ben Adams: That would… that would… that would already come from Estimate Gas.

579
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:40.620
CPerezz: The problem is, for Estimate Gas to work, the access list has to have the account whose code hash is, basically your bytecode, hash, right? So…

580
01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:51.920
CPerezz: Estimate Gas will only work correctly if you are already providing the account, which holds the code that you want to deploy. So that's the… that's the main problem, basically.

581
01:24:53.260 --> 01:25:00.899
Ben Adams: One… one issue I can see with it… Potentially is, block access lists.

582
01:25:01.070 --> 01:25:04.660
Ben Adams: You know, how does…

583
01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:15.890
Ben Adams: where you have a contract deploy… the same contract deployed in the same block, is there… there might be some weird edges around pricing and parallel execution.

584
01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:22.750
Ben Adams: Because you're… I'm not sure how that would work with block access.

585
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:30.299
CPerezz: I mean, transaction ordering is still a thing, right? Even if you have block access lists, meaning the way in which you

586
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:36.660
CPerezz: Execute the transactions is not related to how they are ordered in the block, so…

587
01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:43.449
CPerezz: Theoretically, the order of the block is what rules the entire thing, discount-wise at least.

588
01:25:44.060 --> 01:25:47.200
Ben Adams: Yeah, but what I mean is you're… you're now…

589
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:52.130
Ben Adams: Changing the pricing of a transaction based on an earlier transaction.

590
01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:58.220
Ben Adams: If you see what I mean. So you need to know whether the earlier transaction deployed the contract.

591
01:25:58.430 --> 01:26:01.880
Ben Adams: That you're trying to deploy in a later transaction, so you're…

592
01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.780
CPerezz: Sure. Independency.

593
01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:18.989
CPerezz: Sure, that's true. I mean, the odds of that happening are scarce, I would say, because basically, this means that in a block, two people, or the same one through two different accounts, deployed

594
01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:38.499
CPerezz: the same exact bike code, which wasn't existing up to this point. So, I mean, this, of course, can happen, but it would be very weird, I would say. Nevertheless, I think since this is contract deployment, and it will be heavily, heavily priced, block access lists.

595
01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:53.669
CPerezz: won't have, like, much to do there, meaning if you have two 24 kilobyte deployment, within a block, there's not… there's not much more room left for… for computing, much stuff. I mean, depending on the gas prices, of course, but…

596
01:27:10.510 --> 01:27:16.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, any further… Comments, discussion points on this specific EIP?

597
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:26.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: And, Carlos, can you remind me? This one is not yet in the PFI list, right? So this will also still be added, or…

598
01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:37.039
CPerezz: I made the PR during the call, so, I mean, I'm unsure if the bot, versed it. No, it's still… I mean, it's in the CI phase, so… Okay.

599
01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:38.710
CPerezz: It's bending again.

600
01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:40.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect, sounds good.

601
01:27:40.770 --> 01:27:41.480
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, no.

602
01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:42.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah.

603
01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:59.040
Toni Wahrstätter: One last question, just, I was just typing it, but I felt like it makes more sense to just, say it. The last comment of Carlos, that with the block access list, I think it wouldn't be a problem, because the code deployment is also mapped to a transaction ID.

604
01:27:59.310 --> 01:28:03.160
Toni Wahrstätter: So, I think Carlos is right there, that it shouldn't be a problem.

605
01:28:12.380 --> 01:28:26.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, awesome. Then… thank you, Carlos. The unfortunate news is that then, out of the EIPs section, we actually removed two, but added three. So, not going our way, but…

606
01:28:27.490 --> 01:28:33.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: At least, that's all for today, so no more… no more added now. Let's see how many more come throughout the week.

607
01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:41.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, I think that's all for today, then. There was an open discussion section, but I think it's really best if we leave the Glamstadum discussion to…

608
01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:48.289
Ansgar Dietrichs: two weeks from now. And so with that, thank you everyone for coming, and, talk to you all in two weeks.

609
01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:50.169
Ansgar Dietrichs: And… in between.

610
01:28:53.250 --> 01:28:54.210
potuz: Bye.

611
01:28:54.430 --> 01:28:54.869
Justin Florentine (Besu): Thank you.

612
01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.430
Guillaume: But…

613
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:57.299
Carl Beekhuizen: Thanks, Al.

614
01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.120
CPerezz: Right.
