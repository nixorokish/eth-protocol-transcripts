Yes, @kamil could chime in on this
00:20:09	Pari:	Replying to "is there a standard ..."

Yes, we use reference hardware machines that were the same as the benchmarker machines used for gas limit increases throughout the year
00:21:43	Maria Silva:	For clarity, EIP-8073 is not yet merged. But it is a simple change to EIP-8037, which we can easily add

00:22:58	Francesco:	Another option could be to modify 8075 to just do separate metering of state growth (as in the more general multidimensional metering), without the adaptive  state_gas_per_byte  component
00:23:25	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Another option could..."

Correct
00:23:29	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Another option could..."

 Ah, nvm, thx for sharing
00:24:41	Francesco:	Replying to "Another option could..."

Full multidim meaning metering or pricing? If the former, the difference is that it’s only adding the state growth dimension to the metering, rather than a few resources
00:24:45	Ameziane Hamlat:	Are the numbers going to change for EIP-7904 following the results of the benchmarks ?

00:25:17	raxhvl:	Reacted to "Please can we rename..." with 👍

I think it would be changed according to new benchmark results
00:25:31	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Another option could..."

A key difference is that 8075 excludes state creation cost from the bock limit, instead of using the max function as multidimensional metering
00:25:50	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Are the numbers goin..."

Yes, it will use the recent benchmarks

00:28:59	Guillaume:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

what is "access" here ?
00:29:05	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

State IO
00:29:18	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

State -> state writeAccess -> state read?
00:29:37	Luis Pinto | Besu:	BALs will make compute much cheaper than state access, why don’t we go through a general repricing after that is integrated? It feels we will go through another round of repricing after all clients implement that
00:29:42	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

State is storage cost i think. access is read/write
00:29:45	Guillaume:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

+1, I'd like to know
00:29:50	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

What is Bandwith?
00:30:18	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

State Access is IO, State is state growth
00:30:35	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

Bandwidth is call data (excludes blob)
00:31:00	Guillaume:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

so access also includes writes, but writes that are not growing the state ?
00:31:03	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

got it, so post glamsterdam this will be highly domiated by State?
00:31:07	Ansgar Dietrichs:	my understanding is actually that BALs benefit state access to a similar degree to compute.
compute: parallelization
state reads: batch reads
state writes: parallelized state root calculation
00:31:28	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "BALs will make compu..."

I split each opcode cost into the different components. For instance, SSTORE has a component for compute, state access and state growth
00:32:12	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "BALs will make compu..."

True state access will be much trivial
00:32:17	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

Here is the analysis: https://ethresear.ch/t/going-multidimensional-an-empirical-analysis-on-gas-metering-in-the-evm/22621
00:32:22	Toni Wahrstätter:	Reacted to fyi :) - Glamsterdam... with "🔥"
00:32:23	Guillaume:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

so acess is just reads, not IO
00:32:44	Maria Silva:	Replying to "Here is the breakdow..."

SSTORE also contributes to state IO

Wdym? We are trying to run them on different networks, the problem is that the infra for running it is a bit jank at the moment
01:00:35	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "could they not be ..."

Or do you think the three networks  we're planning for are too much?

01:00:49	jochem-brouwer:	Hegota*
01:01:05	Guillaume:	Replying to "could they not be ru..."

I mean, if the problem is that it's slow so it can't be run 5x  a day, maybe we can 5x the networks in parallel
01:01:14	frangio:	"AA concerns" are more specifically ERC-4337 concerns, btw
01:01:17	Guillaume:	Replying to "could they not be ru..."

So 7971 w/h limit
01:06:02	frangio:	so this should be with the Repricing group?
01:08:08	draganrakita:	True 🙂
01:08:12	Marius van der Wijden:	dfi

01:10:00	Maria Silva:	100% Agreed with Guillaume
01:11:04	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I personally would propose waiting with 8032 decision until Jan 5, to have better state benchmarks.

those better benchmark numbers will tell us how harsh the state access cost increases will be without this EIP, which will inform the urgency here.
01:11:09	Maria Silva:	8038 has a section on how it can be complemented with 8032: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8038#interaction-with-eip-8032
01:11:59	lightclient:	does delay mean CFI?
01:12:38	Ansgar Dietrichs:	we have not made any SFI decisions beyond headliners
01:12:44	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "we have not made any..."

CFI is already strong signal
01:13:03	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "does delay mean CF..."

Also delaying to Jan 5. gives us a better overview of the scope of the CFI'd eips and if we still have space in the fork

what's the exact concern that you have?
01:14:00	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "does delay mean CF..."

Good point, also regarding interactions with these EIPs which might not directly be clear
01:14:25	draganrakita:	Replying to "Would DFI it bcs of ..."

Migration is something that was never done
01:14:30	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "sorry guys just jo..."

fyi we have DFI'd the evm memory limit eips
01:14:48	Charles:	ack
01:15:15	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "sorry guys just jo..."

There's only so much space we have in a fork :(
01:15:21	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Would also postpone to January, but it looks important to bring root hash computation complexity into the protocol
01:15:24	Wei Han Ng:	Replying to "Would DFI it bcs of ..."

this particular migration is much simpler than the verkle one, and verkle migration has worked and tested before
01:15:52	jochem-brouwer:	I think this iterator is less complex than we might imagine. But thats coming from prototyping 😅 I think we can setup tests just like everything else, and make something which looks complex actually less complex.
Some EIPs look simple, but are more complex than we think. Some EIPs look complex, but are actually "simpler" than we might imagine beforehand
01:15:55	Ansgar Dietrichs:	could we ask the testing team to make a testing impact assessment by Jan 5? obv might not be possible for them with holidays in between
01:15:57	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "sorry guys just jo..."

The decision for Limit for transient storage is delayed until Jan 5. in order to see if we can get rid of the hard cap

How many Trie migrations do we need? :)
01:17:37	Mario Vega:	Replying to "could we ask the tes..."

Transition is hard, regardless of whether has it been done already, our testing framework has to be updated to account for forks that have a transition period, we had a prototype for verkle yes, but having a prototype is one thing and having all tests updated and compatible is a different one
01:17:39	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "I know it can be don..."

Can it wait for binary tries?
01:17:50	jochem-brouwer:	Why 2926 already DFId in this doc?

01:19:29	Danno Ferrin (Tectonic):	Lido also opposed 2926
01:19:39	Ansgar Dietrichs:	in terms of opposition: Besu and Erigon had 2926 listed as DFI preference
01:19:45	Łukasz Rozmej:	After Verkle everything will seem simple ;)
01:19:45	lightclient:	7907 is much harder than we make it out to be
01:19:59	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "Why 2926 already D..."

Ansgar compiled the list from comments on the last ACDs as well as the preference documents of the clients
01:20:14	Charles:	Replying to "sorry guys just jo..."

Alright, yes sorry about this comment, my personal perception was that this was "less DFI candidate" than I get from the actual analysis, so I understand now why it is listed here as-is :)
01:24:51	draganrakita:	EIP-7907 gives u 80/20 benefit on contract size, so this is why we support its inclusion.

2926 actually solves it though 🙁

01:36:23	jochem-brouwer:	I want to add here, the code size increase for both 2926 and 7907 also has interactions with the gas repricing for the state. So from that perspective, it would make sense to reconsider this in Hegota
