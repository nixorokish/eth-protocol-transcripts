1
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.490
jochem-brouwer: Hey, honey.

2
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, hello, everyone.

3
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:15.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: Can y'all hear me right?

4
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.500
jochem-brouwer: Yes, yes, how are you?

5
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.860
Ansgar Dietrichs: Good, good, good.

6
00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: Looking forward to yet another packed call.

7
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.039
jochem-brouwer: Yes, yes, yes.

8
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:38.869
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is the microphone okay, by the way? I emptied a glass of juice over this, and this is the first time I'm using the microphone since having the laptop repaired.

9
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.199
Justin Florentine (Besu): great and full of vitamin C.

10
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: It's awesome.

11
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.779
jochem-brouwer: Better than, than normal, so, yeah.

12
00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, wow.

13
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: They built in an aftermarket improved microphone, maybe.

14
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.700
Danno Ferrin (Tectonic): Did Mike Neff finally deliver?

15
00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:11.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maybe, maybe I should be worried, maybe this implies that they, you know, used a non-standard microphone, you know, maybe, maybe this is a bedside. But anyway, yeah, let's maybe wait for a couple more seconds, and then we can go live.

16
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.579
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, yeah, I think we're good to go live.

17
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.089
Josh Davis: Alright, you're live.

18
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect.

19
00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:57.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: Well, hello. Welcome, everyone, to Allcodev's Call 226.

20
00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:01.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Which will be the last one for this year?

21
00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:08.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, let's get right into it, it'll be another packed one. We have a few…

22
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:16.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: Announcements first, so the first one is specifically concerning the… holiday, schedule?

23
00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:18.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: So,

24
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:37.459
Ansgar Dietrichs: Banabas had a comment on the agenda with the proposed schedule that I also think makes most sense, so I just wanted to briefly get an act on this. So, we have ACDE today, on the 18th of December, then we will have a few calls in a row that will be canceled over the holidays, so…

25
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:42.780
Ansgar Dietrichs: Next week, 22nd and 25th of December, both calls are canceled.

26
00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:50.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: And, then also, the week after, 29th of December and 1st of January, both calls would be canceled.

27
00:06:50.720 --> 00:07:07.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: We would then have… restart the ACD schedule with the 5th of January, which normally would be an ACDT, because that's a Monday, and the proposal here is to change that into an ACDE. So basically, start the year January 5th, with an out-of-schedule ACDE,

28
00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:19.019
Ansgar Dietrichs: And that is just so that we, can finalize any outstanding grump stamp scope decisions that we might have by that point, and really just start the year with a fully finalized FOC scope.

29
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:29.700
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then after that, we would continue as usual, so that week we would then, next to the ACDE, also have an ACDC on Thursday, and then the first ACDT of the year would be the Monday after.

30
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:37.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does that schedule generally… Sound reasonable? If I don't have any objections, then we will just lock that in.

31
00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:41.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect.

32
00:07:41.810 --> 00:08:01.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then also, just to mention, I talked with Tim, and while generally the idea was to basically have Tim take back over at the beginning of the year, we decided that it's, probably doesn't make sense to do that, right at the year cutoff, so I'll still, head the call on January 5th.

33
00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:16.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome. So then, that's the first agenda point, and then on the, announcement side, just a… Kev had a very quick, shoutout he wanted to give to a ZKVM roadmap document that he recently published. Kev, are you on the call?

34
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:33.149
kev: Yep. Yeah, I just wanted to quickly give some visibility, to our roadmap doc, which just entails some of the projects we want to be doing going into 2026. If you have any comments, then please just leave it in the

35
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:37.629
kev: the ETH R&D channel that we have,

36
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:42.349
kev: called L1ZKVM, and Antigar's posted a link in the comments.

37
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:47.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect.

38
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you.

39
00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:58.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep, and those were the announcements, so then we can go right to the, H-star section, so we have a quick H-star section before we get to gramsum scoping, just because there's a few decisions we wanted to get out of the way.

40
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:11.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: Well, few decisions and one just quick summary. Fossil… we've talked enough about Fossil here over the last few weeks, so this time I want to just briefly inform you all, for those of you that were not on the call last week.

41
00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:20.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: There was a decision made to basically, CFI fossil for the upcoming H-star hard fork.

42
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:27.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: So we will have Fossil as a kind of a pre-CFI DAP, and then we'll start the,

43
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: we'll, we'll start the, the headliner process there soon.

44
00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:52.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: With that out of the way, then we… there's another HL-related decision that was made on ACDT, is my understanding, and this is a name change. Apparently, I think there was some issue with the… with HECA not being a proper star or something. I didn't actually pay super close attention, I'm not sure if there's anyone here that can maybe…

45
00:09:52.330 --> 00:10:10.959
Ansgar Dietrichs: briefly explain that, but anyway, there's a new name now for the… for the CL, for the… for the CL site, of the, of the, hard fork, and I unfortunately have no idea how this is pronounced. He's a, his, has, whatever, I don't know, does anyone have context and or know how to pronounce this name?

46
00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:42.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: Hey, Zoo. Alex, I see in chat that you might actually disagree or something. I mean, this was presented to me as a decision that was made on ACDT, not something to decide today, but, if you have context on this, can you, I don't know.

47
00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.230
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do you want to briefly comment on this?

48
00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: No audio, okay.

49
00:10:53.110 --> 00:11:02.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, well, yeah, I don't know, this was not on my list of… to actually make a decision on, I just was going to repeat, but if there's… if there's an issue…

50
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:08.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, well, that's… that's not bike shit. I think, yeah, then let's go with this renaming. So,

51
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.809
Ansgar Dietrichs: we'll just, you know… and it's apparently pronounced Hezu.

52
00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:27.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: Jesus. Okay, that's, I guess, the… the name. Great. And then, we do have a decision, though, and that is on the actual full fork name, the motto of those… of that with Pogota.

53
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:34.920
Ansgar Dietrichs: There was an updated poll in the ETH Magicians using this new first part of the name.

54
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:41.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: And the leading candidate there in the poll is Higota.

55
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:48.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, I just wanted to see if we have agreement to accept Heikota on today's call as an official decision.

56
00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.809
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anyone who has anything? Any veto reason?

57
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:11.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: I agree with Justin that it's a, it's a fun, fun choice that, that it's unpronounceable, but yeah. Okay. Sure, then I think we log in both that individual nickname and the formateau of Hewata.

58
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:15.540
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, looking forward to that, Falk.

59
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: Awesome.

60
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:20.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then,

61
00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:28.109
Ansgar Dietrichs: One more… Actually, I see now that I forgot to put that on the agenda, that's my bad.

62
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:35.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: But, Nick so specifically wanted to get a sign-off on the proposed,

63
00:12:35.630 --> 00:12:44.189
Ansgar Dietrichs: timeline for the… for the HSTAR EAP selection process, both headline and non-headliner, and can post a…

64
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:49.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: link to that in the chat. My bad for not having this on the agenda.

65
00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: Nick, so are you on the call and could briefly speak on… speak to this?

66
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.920
nixo: Yeah, so that, that timeline is proposed.

67
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:11.249
nixo: Opening the headliner proposals, and then choose… And it sort of,

68
00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:27.510
nixo: TBD on the rest of it, depending on how that goes. I would advocate for only 30 days for the non-headliner proposal, but in general, I'd like to get this solidified so that I can, make it a blog post and put it out to the world and sort of, blast that out.

69
00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:50.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just to clarify, I see that in this, link that you shared in the agenda that, that is this post by Alex, that there are still a few TBDs, on the timeline, including what you said, right? Like, the, the exact,

70
00:13:50.430 --> 00:14:00.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: time span for proposing non-Hadland ERPs and whatnot, so are you asking for clarification and fill-in for these TBDs, or would you just announce them with these TBDs still in there?

71
00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:06.809
nixo: No, I would just announce the dates that are written in there, and then say that they're a 30-day window to,

72
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:20.899
nixo: headliner EIPs will follow that, depending on our actual decision-making ability. So, as soon as the headliners are chosen, then the non-headliner proposal window would open up.

73
00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.060
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, sounds good.

74
00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:36.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just for people, you know, so just so we have the foundation, so basically the proposed is that January 8th to February 4th, we would have

75
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:53.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: time for focus discussion and headliner proposals, February 5th to February 26th, we would actually have headliner discussion and finalization, and then, basically, yeah, as you said, proposal is to start the opening up the non-headliner section once the,

76
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: This proposal, once a decision on the headliner is made.

77
00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:05.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Do we generally have agreement on this? Does it sound reasonable for people? Can we announce this as the official timeline, or is there any wishes for corrections, or…

78
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:07.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Adjustments?

79
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:16.590
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

80
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:27.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: Great. Well, these calls are great, I just keep making proposals, and everyone is just quiet, and we just make decisions. Very efficient. Okay, then we… we just, we log in that,

81
00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: Timeline.

82
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:31.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: And apologies again that this was not on the agenda.

83
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:51.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, with all of that out of the way, we are ready for the main part of the call, the Glamstadam, scoping continuation. So just for some context, we made 18 decisions on last call, we have 22 more decisions to go.

84
00:15:51.450 --> 00:16:05.589
Ansgar Dietrichs: I… my goal would be to basically get through the vast majority of these today, and make as many decisions as possible, and then whatever is left over, and there's, like, already one or two EIPs specifically that… where that's generally the recommended action, at least.

85
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:12.540
Ansgar Dietrichs: we would then make those few remaining decisions on January 5th, and then hopefully have a fully locked-in

86
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:14.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: Foxcope by January 5th.

87
00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:25.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: To start off the section, though, there is a short update from the repricing side, and I think, Marius, you want to give a brief overview?

88
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.780
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, hello, everyone. Let me quickly share my screen.

89
00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:41.940
Marius van der Wijden: So, first of all, I'm synthesizing… synthesizai…

90
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:58.709
Marius van der Wijden: I'm combining a lot of the, the work that, the repricing teams have been doing, so a big shout out to, Jocham, and Luis, and Carlos, and Maria, and Camille from the Nethermine team, and the rest of the Nethermine team who's been working on this.

91
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:04.480
Marius van der Wijden: So, they've been putting in a lot of work in order to,

92
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:08.519
Marius van der Wijden: To get us to the point here, and,

93
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:22.069
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, let me jump right in. Short recap, currently we are running at roughly, at max 20 megacity per second. What we are trying to achieve with this,

94
00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:36.480
Marius van der Wijden: Repricing effort is a harmonization between the compute opcodes itself, and then also a harmonization between the areas of compute, state access, data.

95
00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:46.889
Marius van der Wijden: And we want to do a mitigation for state growth. Because if we don't mitigate state growth and we increase the gas limit.

96
00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:51.280
Marius van der Wijden: Then, yeah, the chain will grow much faster.

97
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:58.429
Marius van der Wijden: faster than we would have liked. So what we are, currently…

98
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:03.109
Marius van der Wijden: proposing is to target, 60 megacity per second.

99
00:18:03.270 --> 00:18:09.049
Marius van der Wijden: So all operations below 60 megabits per second would need to be repriced.

100
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:23.620
Marius van der Wijden: up. That is around 18 operations in total. The list, here on the right shows these 18 operations, but this is, pending client improvements and further analysis.

101
00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:28.990
Marius van der Wijden: And one thing that we might want to propose

102
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:35.650
Marius van der Wijden: In the future is, price reductions for… for very expensive operations.

103
00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:39.820
Marius van der Wijden: But this heavily depends on the timelines for,

104
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:46.050
Marius van der Wijden: for, for, for Glemson, and, Yeah, so…

105
00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:54.190
Marius van der Wijden: we don't want to propose that today, but what we want to propose today, is to CFI EIP7904,

106
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.390
Marius van der Wijden: In order to, to move this along.

107
00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:15.580
Marius van der Wijden: For data, we have two EIPs that touch call data, 7976, which increases the call data floor gas, and 7981, which increases the cost for access lists. The numbers in the EIP might change, depending on the other repricings.

108
00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:23.439
Marius van der Wijden: But both of these EIPs are very necessary if you want… if we want to increase the gas limit, and they are ready to go.

109
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:29.529
Marius van der Wijden: And, regarding state access, again, we are targeting 60 megabits per second.

110
00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:45.530
Marius van der Wijden: We have, EAP8038, which, increases the cost for state access. The numbers there are still missing, but, we,

111
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:49.390
Marius van der Wijden: We are very confident that, or…

112
00:19:49.690 --> 00:20:06.430
Marius van der Wijden: we are very clear that there needs to be increases in state access costs, and, in order to scale, and so, numbers there will follow, and we would like to also lock that in today.

113
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:19.510
Marius van der Wijden: 2780 reduces the intrinsic transaction gas. This will need to be updated based on, 8038, and also some of the… maybe some of the repricings that we do.

114
00:20:19.870 --> 00:20:33.429
Marius van der Wijden: We're not trying to force a decision on 2780 today, but overall, it has become quite clear that repricing for state taxes is necessary. For state growth.

115
00:20:33.870 --> 00:20:37.410
Marius van der Wijden: There are 3 options, that we have, AT37,

116
00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:52.570
Marius van der Wijden: State creation gas cost increase, which, which is a fixed, increase of the costs for state creation. 8073, dynamic state pricing for steady growth. This is,

117
00:20:52.850 --> 00:21:06.039
Marius van der Wijden: dynamic state cost creation based on current block limit. This is, proposed by the Netherland team. And 8075, adaptive state cost to cap growth and scale at 1.

118
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.989
Marius van der Wijden: This,

119
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:21.089
Marius van der Wijden: this, introduces, like, a similar mechanism to 1559 in order to, get us to a certain target of state growth per block.

120
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:30.279
Marius van der Wijden: And what has become clear over the last couple of weeks, that some repricing has to be done with regard to state growth.

121
00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:35.159
Marius van der Wijden: And, if we move into the future also.

122
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.480
Marius van der Wijden: Probably state needs to be…

123
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.680
Marius van der Wijden: Measured on a different axis than compute.

124
00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:59.740
Marius van der Wijden: But we… we would like to postpone the decision on which of those, three EIPs to do, in… onto January 5th. And, if you want to learn more about state growth, you can check out Ender's overview of… of the different.

125
00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.149
Marius van der Wijden: Different, proposals.

126
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:03.590
Marius van der Wijden: So, concluding…

127
00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:18.400
Marius van der Wijden: We would like to target, 60 megabits per second with repricings, that would, that would significantly, like, allow for significant more headroom, for scaling.

128
00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:37.150
Marius van der Wijden: We would like to move 7904, the general repricings to CFI today, move 7976, increase call data flow gas to CFI, 7981, increase access list cost to CFI, and we would like to move AT38, the state access gas cost update.

129
00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:41.489
Marius van der Wijden: to CFI. We would like to discuss

130
00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:56.750
Marius van der Wijden: 2780, the reduced intrinsic transaction gas, either on the call today or, postpone it, and we would like to postpone the decision on state growth, to January 5th.

131
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:03.249
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, that is basically… what I wanted to share today.

132
00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:16.600
Marius van der Wijden: I can leave the… I cannot see the… I cannot see… There's the chat, but,

133
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:20.679
Marius van der Wijden: I will leave this up for a bit, so we can discuss it.

134
00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:30.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And now, already, just for context, because for the, actually, in a second, making the CFI and DFI decisions,

135
00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:44.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: I have updated the document that we used last week. I already put the link in chat, but, if there are questions for Marius first, then I think we should, yeah, keep the screen share here for a second. So, are there specific comments on the repricing?

136
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: proposals here.

137
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:54.720
Ben Adams: And just a…

138
00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:04.670
Ben Adams: Just a quick comment on 2780. Additionally, I think ETH transfer logs, that would add a

139
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:07.460
Ben Adams: A small amount additionally on top.

140
00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.449
Ben Adams: Which is a different EIP.

141
00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.050
Marius van der Wijden: Yes.

142
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:22.119
Ansgar Dietrichs: And also, from my side, maybe, just to clarify for… so people are aware, right, the idea would be that while the base cost of a transaction would go down.

143
00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:31.959
Ansgar Dietrichs: in combination with the… the state access, gas cost increase EIP, the cost of a… of a transaction that,

144
00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:44.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: would actually create a new account on the receiving side, would actually go up, right? So basically, we would then be in a world where we have two different base prices, and one of them is below the current $21,000, and the other one is above the current $21,000. Is that… is that correct?

145
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.389
Ben Adams: Yeah, so it aligns, the state growth, and…

146
00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:53.550
Ben Adams: The cost of that account creation will be

147
00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:59.009
Ben Adams: You know, it… depending on what we do with, state growth.

148
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:04.939
Ben Adams: will be that price. But at the moment, there's a loophole where if you create an account.

149
00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:06.340
Ben Adams: That's part of a…

150
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:15.299
Ben Adams: broad transaction, that's cheaper than if you do it as part of a call, which is an inconsistency, so it aligns to the more expensive price.

151
00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:18.159
Ben Adams: And takes it off a regular transaction.

152
00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: Makes sense. Lucas?

153
00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:36.819
Łukasz Rozmej: So, one theoretical kind of question, or, like, philosophical. So, I kind of agree that we probably need to reprise state growth, especially.

154
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:48.279
Łukasz Rozmej: But if state growth is one of the main chain… of chain main usage, if we reprice it similarly as we increase gas limits, the question is, are we really scaling, right? So…

155
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.819
Łukasz Rozmej: If we need to scale, we need to allow for more state growth than we have at the moment.

156
00:25:53.820 --> 00:26:02.929
Marius van der Wijden: That's not 100% true, because if we… we would change the ratio between compute and say growth.

157
00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:06.190
Marius van der Wijden: And that would allow for… for…

158
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.570
Łukasz Rozmej: Marco.

159
00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:08.780
Marius van der Wijden: More… more compute, yes.

160
00:26:08.780 --> 00:26:14.489
Łukasz Rozmej: Yes, true, but how much… percent of gases currently compute?

161
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:17.410
Marius van der Wijden: Dink.

162
00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.000
Maria Silva: That's why…

163
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:20.569
Marius van der Wijden: Do you?

164
00:26:20.570 --> 00:26:23.379
Maria Silva: moment is, like, around 30% is…

165
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:29.440
Łukasz Rozmej: You're breaking out, I didn't get that, sorry.

166
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:36.199
Marius van der Wijden: It's… I think it's 30% of the block is state growth.

167
00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:38.680
Marius van der Wijden: Or state-related operations.

168
00:26:40.670 --> 00:26:42.140
Marius van der Wijden: If I remember correctly.

169
00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:53.179
Ben Adams: Also, with the repricings, if we… if we do them…

170
00:26:53.800 --> 00:27:01.800
Ben Adams: We're reducing the price of compute, so we are effectively increasing, in a relative term, the price of state.

171
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:08.520
Ben Adams: And, you know, it's also dependent on the… gas. Price.

172
00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:16.040
Ben Adams: Which is my concern with the… The basic estate growth one.

173
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:19.340
Ben Adams: Where if we… if we just…

174
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.110
Ben Adams: Versus the two targeted, you know, this is…

175
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:31.189
Ben Adams: targeting a certain amount of state growth and adjust the price. If we just increase the price of state, then potentially

176
00:27:31.390 --> 00:27:37.180
Ben Adams: The gas price drops, and therefore, we end up with just charging less and doing the same growth.

177
00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:41.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. In the interest of kind of getting through much of

178
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:55.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: what we want to get to today, I would propose that we specifically do not discuss the state growth side of this until January 5th, unless people, of course, think that we can't make decisions on these other ones before we actually have discussed state growth more, then of course, we can revisit that, but…

179
00:27:56.090 --> 00:28:07.009
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. One more clarification, maybe, Marius, because I think many people here are still under the impression that most of these EAPs are basically proposed as is, because there was this strong urge to make

180
00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:25.719
Ansgar Dietrichs: CFI decisions today, we actually are in this position where I think a lot of these… some of these EPs will be… are proposed to basically be included as is, so the data ones, for example, and the state access one are basically proposed to be included as is. The general repricing one, that one I think we need to clarify for people here. The proposal, at least from

181
00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:30.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: From the repricing team side would be to radically reduce its scope.

182
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:46.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: only to increasing the cost of compute-related operations that are not currently performing at this 60 megabits per second floor, and remove all other changes to pricing on the compute side, and so that includes removing all of the cost reductions.

183
00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:54.669
Ansgar Dietrichs: Again, this is just the proposed approach, because there were concerns about testing scope for a larger set of changes.

184
00:28:54.830 --> 00:29:02.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: this could be revisited, but I just wanted to say that, just so we are on the shared understanding of what the proposal here is, at least from the

185
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:05.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: That's what the proposal is, radical reduction in scope.

186
00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:11.999
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, like, we are at a point where it doesn't make sense to.

187
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:20.389
Marius van der Wijden: to think about what could be done, maybe, in a certain future. I think it is more important

188
00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:37.430
Marius van der Wijden: what can be done now, and what will bring the biggest benefit. And the biggest benefit right now is to, is to reprice the… these worst cases that we have in the EVM, and, and then, be able to, to increase

189
00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:45.190
Marius van der Wijden: At least theoretically, the throughput from 20 MHz per second to 60 megabits per second.

190
00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:51.859
Marius van der Wijden: And that is before block access lists and before PBS.

191
00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:12.250
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then maybe one more, there's a question in chat from Luis, from Besu, block of access lists will make compute much cheaper than state access, so basically why are we…

192
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:20.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: Basically treating them the same here. Marius, do you want to comment on that?

193
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:25.650
Marius van der Wijden: Well…

194
00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:36.749
Marius van der Wijden: It's not clear to me why, state access should… wouldn't be cheaper, wouldn't be more exp… oh, would, like, wouldn't also get cheaper with, block access lists?

195
00:30:37.110 --> 00:30:39.089
Marius van der Wijden: Because we can…

196
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:48.789
Marius van der Wijden: Load the state, before, and so all of the state would actually be kind of cached at the moment of, of accessing the state.

197
00:30:49.490 --> 00:31:00.959
Marius van der Wijden: And also, The numbers for the state access costs will definitely be revisited once we have

198
00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:05.870
Marius van der Wijden: a, version of block access list life that we can.

199
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.010
Marius van der Wijden: That we can really… that resembles the final thing, and that we can use to, to measure.

200
00:31:13.170 --> 00:31:14.350
Marius van der Wijden: All of this.

201
00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:22.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. And basically.

202
00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:39.860
Ansgar Dietrichs: For context, this proposed 60 megah per second floor is in a way more heuristic, of saying, yes, we could continue to wait until we have perfect numbers post local boxes and EPBS, but by then, at that point, we'll be very late into the fork process, so instead we just do the

203
00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.879
Ansgar Dietrichs: Next best thing, the cheap thing to do here, that is just to pick a…

204
00:31:43.920 --> 00:32:01.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: pragmatic flaw, and then, yes, probably after the benefits we get from local access and EPBS, that probably means that compute and state are not quite performing at the exact same level, because they'll receive somewhat different speedups from these changes, but given that it's hard to predict how they will fall out today.

205
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.409
Ansgar Dietrichs: by just targeting the same floor, we'll get similar-ish benefits, at least. I think that that is the…

206
00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:09.530
Ansgar Dietrichs: The intention here behind such a simple shared floor.

207
00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:24.099
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, do we have more questions to this? Because otherwise I would just start to, like, have us move over to the other document, the main document with all the EIPs, and then we can talk about whether to follow these recommendations or not.

208
00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:44.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maybe one more before we go there. How do people feel about this downscoping of the general repricings one? Obviously, again, it's called general pricings today. It had this large ambition of repricing everything and making a lot of compute cheaper. It would now only make…

209
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:51.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: basically the things below the flow more expensive instead? Are people generally okay with that recommendation? Would they want a more ambitious scope?

210
00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:56.410
Ansgar Dietrichs: what is the feeling on that ERP in particular, Ben?

211
00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:04.650
Ben Adams: I'd like to leave the door open to, also decreasing costs, but… not as…

212
00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:07.949
Ben Adams: You know, a hard… a hard band. See how we go.

213
00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:13.959
Ben Adams: At least, I mean, it's obviously better to…

214
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:17.399
Ben Adams: To remove the worst cases is the first step.

215
00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:20.310
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Dragon.

216
00:33:20.940 --> 00:33:25.379
draganrakita: We will be fine with increased scope and repricing every output.

217
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.500
draganrakita: At least CPU, related one, related data IP.

218
00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:40.079
Marius van der Wijden: Right, and… The problem, like, the problem with increasing scope is that

219
00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:45.050
Marius van der Wijden: The work is not on the client teams,

220
00:33:45.570 --> 00:33:51.209
Marius van der Wijden: to do this, like, the work on the client teams is very easy, they just need to…

221
00:33:51.440 --> 00:34:00.559
Marius van der Wijden: change one variable. The bulk of the work is on the testing teams and the benchmarking teams.

222
00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:06.060
Marius van der Wijden: To, do all of these benchmarks. And,

223
00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:11.340
Marius van der Wijden: we have a lot of people working on it, but I don't…

224
00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:30.739
Marius van der Wijden: realistically see us. If the… if the rest team would step up and say, we put, like, 2 or 3 engineers on, into this effort, and, in order to get the full repricings, and have, like, the extensive effort, then I think

225
00:34:31.429 --> 00:34:41.380
Marius van der Wijden: then I think we would… we would be in a much better state. But, as I've seen in the discussions around repricings and state float.

226
00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:45.270
Marius van der Wijden: Many teams are not…

227
00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:52.660
Marius van der Wijden: are not as focused on it, or do not put as much resources into it as I would have liked.

228
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.580
Marius van der Wijden: So, yeah.

229
00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:06.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: Dragon?

230
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.910
draganrakita: And we have, like, that big, gas,

231
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.069
draganrakita: I'm not sure of how it's called.

232
00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.869
draganrakita: Basically, 4th to 5th version, that basically specifies how, or recommends how the gas should be moved.

233
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:27.060
draganrakita: And I wasn't DCIP, basically, based on that data.

234
00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:34.090
draganrakita: Shouldn't we just reuse those data? Basically, somebody already did that kind of work.

235
00:35:35.410 --> 00:35:46.160
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, but, that data is… Not… Very good. I would… To put it lightly.

236
00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:52.850
draganrakita: Okay, then the confidence on the data is… not… Not great. Okay.

237
00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:10.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and maybe one last comment there from my side. I personally think that repricings will be a big part of Ethereum going forwards in general, and I think the plan is to add this into a more standardized pipeline, and…

238
00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:12.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: say, by H-star, have…

239
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:29.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: enough confidence in the data situation that we can also do more larger-scale repricings. If we are fast with this, then maybe some of these repricings might end up making their way back into this ERP, if there's room and there's time, but basically start with the minimum scope for now that we need, which would just be the

240
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:35.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: The floor, and we can always add things back if… into the fork process, we realize we have room and time.

241
00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:39.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: It's easy to do, but basically better to start small.

242
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:40.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then to start too ambitious.

243
00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:51.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. Then, I think, kind of, we can move to the main, kind of, decision-making section here. I think, Josh, you wanted to…

244
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: share your screen. The document is…

245
00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:00.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: Here, I put the link in chat. It's the same document as last time, just,

246
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: I updated the annotations,

247
00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:11.390
Ansgar Dietrichs: And marked the… all the decisions, you'll see further down in the document, I marked out all the decisions that we… that we did last week.

248
00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:16.389
Ansgar Dietrichs: As of 30 minutes ago, they're also reflected in the meta-EIP, by the way.

249
00:37:16.610 --> 00:37:23.810
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, so then let's first talk about the repricing section. So, just to repeat, $27.80 is a bit…

250
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:31.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: a separate decision, because that one we can or cannot do, depending on how people feel like it. It had pretty strong support from all the clients.

251
00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:38.609
Ansgar Dietrichs: So I would… that… it is a CFI candidate for that reason. And then the other four, basically,

252
00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:42.549
Ansgar Dietrichs: Specifically the recommendations from the repricing side.

253
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:50.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: If we would prefer to not do one of them, then we should revisit all four decisions, because those four are really…

254
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:56.979
Ansgar Dietrichs: only, impactful if they're done together. But maybe let's first take the decision on 2780.

255
00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: How do people feel about this? This had pretty strong support across all clients.

256
00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: Anyone that opposes a CFI decision?

257
00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.419
Ben Adams: I obviously support it, but I'd just like to highlight, as I say,

258
00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.970
Ben Adams: It does also depend on… Some other repricings.

259
00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.010
Ben Adams: For the exact numbers.

260
00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:49.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I would say, in general, this is maybe something that's a bit unique to this section, the entire, kind of, repricing section here. All of these EIPs would be included as an intention to basically do these changes. Well, the general repricing ones, the EIP also needs to be updated to reflect specifically this floor.

261
00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:59.439
Ansgar Dietrichs: Production and scope, but all the other ones roughly have the right scope, but the values in all of them would be subject to change, and probably would continue to be subject to change for…

262
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:01.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: For a while longer into the fog.

263
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:11.650
draganrakita: In general, 2718 makes sense to add. I would just slightly modify it, or basically have discussion around it.

264
00:39:12.110 --> 00:39:31.330
draganrakita: to exclude… the problem with when the transaction creates new… new target, new account, I would make this dynamic check. Basically, make interesting gas only include the bytes that's going to be sent, and the count access of the caller that's going to be done.

265
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:35.220
draganrakita: And when the transaction starts executing.

266
00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:45.349
draganrakita: We deduce… deduct additional gas if… depending if the value is more than zero, and if the target account is not existing.

267
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:49.670
draganrakita: And of course, fail if there is not enough gas to do this suction.

268
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:55.789
Ben Adams: I mean, that's… that's essentially what it… what it, what it proposes.

269
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.090
Ben Adams: Blitz sit.

270
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:58.810
Ben Adams: It breaks down…

271
00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:10.020
Ben Adams: The intrinsic gasped into parts, and then says, okay, so the intrinsic gas is very low, and now, depending what you're doing on top, you start adding parts.

272
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.220
Ben Adams: Rather than.

273
00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:11.840
draganrakita: Yep.

274
00:40:12.010 --> 00:40:17.389
draganrakita: Yeah, but it does it as the part of interest to gas. What I'm saying is, let's split that.

275
00:40:17.540 --> 00:40:24.480
draganrakita: To not have additional check in intersection pool, and just do that check at… as part of execution.

276
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:30.570
draganrakita: In this sense,

277
00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:39.530
draganrakita: The gas that is part of interest, the gas, it doesn't… it can be split from the gas that's needed for creating new state.

278
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:45.419
Ben Adams: Okay, but that would just be the gas limit on the transaction, and then you'd…

279
00:40:45.850 --> 00:40:47.399
Ben Adams: You'd fail by saying that.

280
00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:55.139
draganrakita: Doesn't even… okay, I think there were some more details, yeah.

281
00:40:55.640 --> 00:41:04.739
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, my question is, Dargan, would you feel comfortable, say, CFI-ing the CIP today, and then figuring out these details afterwards, asynchronous, or would you prefer

282
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:09.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: To basically have all of these details worked out before you would want to make a final decision.

283
00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:15.280
draganrakita: CFI today. Anything that we chose, it's good enough and can be included.

284
00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.509
draganrakita: It's not a blocker.

285
00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.379
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. Then, anyone else with something they see as a blocker here?

286
00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:28.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: then…

287
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:42.739
Ansgar Dietrichs: I would say that this is a CFI decision. So, one CFI decision to go, down, I mean. And then, let's take the other ones one by one, but maybe start with the one that was the most…

288
00:41:46.330 --> 00:41:56.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: uncertain, which was the, the last one in this list, actually. 80… 38 state access gas cost increase, because if there's one that possibly has an issue.

289
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:01.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then it's this one, I think, so let's maybe discuss this one first. Do we feel comfortable

290
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:11.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: making a CFI decision on this one, with the understanding that basically we'll specifically establish this 60 megap per second floor.

291
00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.259
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is that basically anyone Feels uncomfortable with that.

292
00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:42.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: is there, in general, like, is there support for CFI? Is just… do people not have an opinion? Like, what's the…

293
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: What is the… the client situation here?

294
00:43:02.810 --> 00:43:06.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: We can also, of course, delay decisions. It felt like…

295
00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:14.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, Ben, could you briefly comment on why you would prefer the delayed decision?

296
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:23.860
Ben Adams: Yeah, so there's… there's, like, 3 in this area, and…

297
00:43:24.670 --> 00:43:26.550
Ben Adams: I think it needs a bit.

298
00:43:27.110 --> 00:43:28.599
Ben Adams: Bit more consideration.

299
00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:32.630
Ben Adams: I don't think it's straightforward.

300
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:38.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: Are you talking about the state growth one, or the state access one? Because, sorry, this is very confusing.

301
00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:39.250
Ben Adams: This one specifically.

302
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:42.190
Ansgar Dietrichs: It's the state access one, so this would only make,

303
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:47.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: S-stores and S-loads to existing locations, like, affect that pricing.

304
00:43:48.090 --> 00:43:50.200
Ben Adams: I apologize. I misread.

305
00:43:50.710 --> 00:44:08.949
Ansgar Dietrichs: No, I think, I mean, yeah, I should really make this clearer. So, so this one is specifically not about state growth. So this state growth one is the one that is… in the separate section below. That one, the recommendation will be to talk about it on January 5th for a decision. So this, this one that we're talking about right now, 8038, is just about…

306
00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: Interactions with existing state.

307
00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: I just…

308
00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:22.490
Ansgar Dietrichs: You took this one first, because out of all of the previous discussions of these, repricing changes, this was always the one that was…

309
00:44:22.890 --> 00:44:29.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: had the least clear support, so I wanted to check on this one first, given that they really need to be included as a bundle, basically.

310
00:44:30.210 --> 00:44:39.119
Ben Adams: I mean, one of the issues is it's all TBD, so it doesn't say whether we're increasing or decreasing, and it will be very affected by bowels.

311
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:46.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, the idea would be to have this in…

312
00:44:46.590 --> 00:45:00.199
Ansgar Dietrichs: enforce a flow of 60 MHz per second, even without taking the impact of EPBS or balls into account, so that then, with the impact of EPBS and BALTS, we can run it at an even higher

313
00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:06.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: Gas per second, so this would… result in an…

314
00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.880
Ansgar Dietrichs: With a… in the price increase for most operations there.

315
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:18.859
Ben Adams: And it does have the issue that we may break a lot of…

316
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.430
Ben Adams: People who do gas introspection limits.

317
00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:30.280
Ben Adams: So decreasing is easier, because it doesn't break anything.

318
00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:41.149
Ansgar Dietrichs: But the problem is if… yeah, again, the reason why that was proposed is just that if everything else is priced so that it basically can run it.

319
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:46.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: 60 megabits per second or something, and then state can only run at 20 or 30.

320
00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: then we are running the entire AVM at, like, half speed because of it.

321
00:45:51.440 --> 00:46:06.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: So that's why. And of course, the point would be, if we CFI it, that means that now it will be subject to thorough testing. Testing does include backwards compatibility checks, so that does not yet mean it's definitely in the fork, it just means we basically prioritize

322
00:46:07.570 --> 00:46:09.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: Figuring out all of these issues.

323
00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.610
Ben Adams: Yep, I'm okay with that.

324
00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:19.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, I mean, from the get side, obviously we have heard from Marius. Is there anyone else from the Get side on that has…

325
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:21.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: A take on whether Geth would…

326
00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: be in favor of the CAP?

327
00:46:31.690 --> 00:46:34.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: Otherwise, I would just… Take Marie's.

328
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:42.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: take on this for Geth, and then do we have, from, Wrath, Besu, or Aragon, do we have…

329
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: opinions?

330
00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:56.890
Ameziane Hamlat: on… on… on the basis side, I think we are fine with this EIP.

331
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.419
Ameziane Hamlat: I agree, like, to be…

332
00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:08.759
Ameziane Hamlat: TBD is a bit confusing, but I guess, I know that there are some, some benchmarks

333
00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:23.720
Ameziane Hamlat: that are, happening right now, so, yeah, if, if the repricing is based on, real data and the benchmarking, I think it makes sense to, to, to change,

334
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:27.070
Ameziane Hamlat: State access, pricing.

335
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: Sounds good. And yeah, I think basically this is the main decision we have to make for these four ERPs. Do we make the inclusion decision today?

336
00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:52.669
Ansgar Dietrichs: Knowing that we still… there's still quite a bit of benchmarking work to go, or do we basically just keep them in this PFI state for as long as we take for the benchmarking, which basically delays the decision for quite a while longer?

337
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:58.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: I personally would be open to both, but I think overall there was

338
00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:03.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: strong desire to basically make decisions sooner rather than later. Guillaume?

339
00:48:04.030 --> 00:48:27.689
Guillaume: Yeah, in this, respect, and to be, like, full disclosure, people from my team have actually worked on the… I think this is the IP someone from my team worked on, but I think we should include it, because if we don't, you know, consider it for, like, if we don't CFI it, everything will be pushed, pushed down the road, like, okay, this one hasn't been benchmarked.

340
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:31.150
Guillaume: Let's not look at it until it's been benchmarked, and so on.

341
00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:46.640
Guillaume: So if we… if we don't CFI it today, I don't think the benchmark will happen as quickly as we need them, so I would be in favor of, of CFI-ing it just for this reason, and then if we turn out… if it turns out the benchmarks are not good enough, or whatever.

342
00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:52.380
Guillaume: we, you know, considered doesn't mean included for sure, so I'd say it doesn't cost much to…

343
00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:57.569
Guillaume: Yeah, just, just go for it, and get those benchmarks.

344
00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:04.539
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay. Yeah, I think that actually seems to express sentiment here quite well for people.

345
00:49:04.710 --> 00:49:10.120
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then I would propose we actually make a CFI decision now, last chance for anyone to object.

346
00:49:13.050 --> 00:49:30.709
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we CFI8038. For the other three in this list, then let's go just, one by one from the top. So, the next one would be 7904, general repricing. Again, just to reiterate the current shape of the ERP, as you can see it if you click on it.

347
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:50.259
Ansgar Dietrichs: It will be still the more ambitious scope that would be touching a lot of compute. The idea here would be that we are CFI-ing it with the decision of only downscoping it to the cost increases to establish this floor, and later on into the FOG process, see if we possibly have room to add back some of these cheaper prices.

348
00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.290
Ansgar Dietrichs: Is there a position to CFI there?

349
00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:05.350
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes?

350
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:07.840
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah.

351
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:25.320
Ameziane Hamlat: Quick question. I understand that, like, the numbers are going to change depending on the benchmark's results as well, but my question is related to one of the slides that you shared, Marius.

352
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:37.709
Ameziane Hamlat: So, for this target of 60 MGS per second, there are some opcodes that, would need to, to… to have, like, a different replacing, basically, make them even…

353
00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:46.819
Ameziane Hamlat: even more expensive, like, meal mode, from what I understand. Is that correct? Like, I mean, like, the repricing is not in one sense, we can have, like…

354
00:50:47.330 --> 00:50:49.969
Ameziane Hamlat: both kind of replacing make.

355
00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:54.829
Ameziane Hamlat: Sum-up codes cheaper, and other ones, more expensive.

356
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.340
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, so…

357
00:50:55.340 --> 00:50:56.580
Ameziane Hamlat: Is that correct? Yeah.

358
00:50:56.580 --> 00:51:01.550
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, so right now, we are only… only really proposing to make things more expensive.

359
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:10.780
Marius van der Wijden: And in order to get to the target of 60 MHz per second, we would need this is… my…

360
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:17.480
Marius van der Wijden: This is pending benchmarks, but the way benchmarks are looking right now, we would need to reprice

361
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:24.089
Marius van der Wijden: 13 operations… And let me look at the slides, if that was correct.

362
00:51:24.090 --> 00:51:24.660
Ameziane Hamlat: 18 or…

363
00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:29.710
Marius van der Wijden: 18… so, sorry, 18 operations, yes. And,

364
00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.530
Marius van der Wijden: Some of them would only need to be repriced by…

365
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:43.780
Marius van der Wijden: By 10%, but, some of them would need to be repriced by, like, 3X, roughly.

366
00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:49.299
Marius van der Wijden: So for example, The point evaluation precompile.

367
00:51:49.550 --> 00:52:03.290
Marius van der Wijden: roughly runs at, so, the analysis that we did right now, P99 of, of, like, 7 days of benchmarks, so, like, I don't know, like.

368
00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:13.879
Marius van der Wijden: 50 benchmarks, or, or so, of all clients, and, in P99, we arrive at,

369
00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:19.820
Marius van der Wijden: For the point evaluation, we arrive at, 31.

370
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:29.430
Marius van der Wijden: Oh, sorry. Yeah, we arrive at, at 31… Mega gas per second, so…

371
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:35.880
Marius van der Wijden: We would need to reprice, by… 2.5.

372
00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:36.870
Marius van der Wijden: X.

373
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:52.460
Ameziane Hamlat: I see. So, so just to be sure, AIP7904, like, as it is today, it is more about, like, having more throughput on, on, on arithmetic operations, so basically.

374
00:52:52.550 --> 00:52:58.880
Ameziane Hamlat: make them cheaper? Are we talking about, like, the opposite? Like, make, yes.

375
00:52:59.100 --> 00:52:59.850
Marius van der Wijden: Exactly.

376
00:53:00.090 --> 00:53:10.530
Marius van der Wijden: So, yeah, we, we, we will be, considerably rewriting the… the list in… 7904.

377
00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:13.330
Marius van der Wijden: Ben?

378
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:18.860
Ben Adams: Yeah, so I assume the goal coming out of the minimal.

379
00:53:19.230 --> 00:53:26.670
Ben Adams: Changes would be to… Be able to increase the gas limit, versus,

380
00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:29.870
Ben Adams: Do more at the same decimate.

381
00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:32.170
Ben Adams: Which would be the lowering price.

382
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:33.060
Marius van der Wijden: Yes.

383
00:53:39.630 --> 00:53:41.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so this is kind of, in a way.

384
00:53:41.890 --> 00:53:54.549
Ansgar Dietrichs: a bit of a process compromise, because I think it could also have been a new EIP instead, to basically say, okay, this 790704, by its spirit, was more about making things cheaper. Instead, we want to have… make things more expensive.

385
00:53:54.610 --> 00:54:07.489
Ansgar Dietrichs: But of course, given that the proposal window is already closed, it seemed more appropriate to just reuse the existing kind of compute repricing EAP, even though the nature of the EAP indeed does change now, as people have picked up on.

386
00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:21.189
Ansgar Dietrichs: It seemed like there was then, with these clarifications about the intention here, that there was broad CFI support. Any remaining questions?

387
00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:33.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, where we can see if I had this one.

388
00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:49.199
Ansgar Dietrichs: The other two are much smaller in scope each, they're just adjustments to the data side of things. It is definitely possible there that the numbers might also still be adjusted, of course, pending kind of looking more into this, although I think Tony already had

389
00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:55.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: quite a bit of confidence into these rough numbers, at least, but basically, with that caveat said,

390
00:54:55.880 --> 00:55:03.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Any, any, opposition to CFI-ing, 7976.

391
00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:21.759
Ansgar Dietrichs: then I would say, CFI. And, any opposition to CFI-ing 7981?

392
00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:25.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: That is specific to the, access list.

393
00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: That bitch.

394
00:55:28.560 --> 00:55:35.990
Ben Adams: I'd just like to express a strong spot on that, because Accessless, since we're also doing bowels,

395
00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.790
Ben Adams: They become sort of irrelevant, other than the…

396
00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:45.429
Ben Adams: Very original purpose that they were introduced for, which was fixing broken contracts.

397
00:55:47.830 --> 00:55:49.810
Ben Adams: Otherwise, they're like a hindrant.

398
00:55:50.790 --> 00:55:51.300
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yep.

399
00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:53.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: I agree.

400
00:55:55.210 --> 00:56:01.929
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, but yeah, let's for now just see if I did this, and we can, in later folks think about a more proper.

401
00:56:02.040 --> 00:56:07.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: deprecation. But yeah. Okay, then we, CFI all EIPs in this section.

402
00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:11.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: Nice.

403
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:23.509
Ansgar Dietrichs: Just to move to the next one, again, the recommendation would be to not make a decision today on the… on basically the exact, way in which we want to… to… to tackle state creation, state… state growth,

404
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.649
Ansgar Dietrichs: Pricing, do people agree with that? To delay that decision until January 5th?

405
00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:38.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we can move to the next section.

406
00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:44.740
Łukasz Rozmej: I have a question. So, is there a plan what will happen between today and January 5th, though?

407
00:56:46.090 --> 00:56:53.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so the people, at least some of the people at the EF that are working on this topic will be working in the meantime.

408
00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:05.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: And so, the idea would be that, by A January 5th, we just have more time to dive into this topic, because we won't be so cramped with other decisions, and then B, by then we should also have

409
00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:07.430
Ansgar Dietrichs: Some more data, too.

410
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:09.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: Support that decision.

411
00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:15.749
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I can… I can shine a light on what's happening with the state benchmarks.

412
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:18.770
Marius van der Wijden: We,

413
00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:29.410
Marius van der Wijden: bloating again, to a 4x minutes state, and in the meantime, we are also, updating our infrastructure to run

414
00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:34.809
Marius van der Wijden: These, the state-related benchmarks on

415
00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:44.530
Marius van der Wijden: basically different state, whatever, like, snapshot we have of whatever network we want to run, and we want to run them on

416
00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:57.149
Marius van der Wijden: on a snapshot of mainnet, on a snapshot of 2x mainnet, and on a snapshot of 4x mainnet at least, to see, to see how these numbers compare,

417
00:57:57.220 --> 00:58:12.100
Marius van der Wijden: what, what we, will be running into in, in the future, and, in order to get more accurate numbers. Like, I can, for, so for the op codes.

418
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:13.909
Marius van der Wijden: They have been running…

419
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:21.460
Marius van der Wijden: Also, for the compute, operations, we have, pretty good benchmarks now, and they have been running,

420
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:27.529
Marius van der Wijden: Every couple of hours, but for the state benchmark, the, the,

421
00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:32.470
Marius van der Wijden: The infrastructure is just significantly more complex, and,

422
00:58:32.790 --> 00:58:46.869
Marius van der Wijden: So, we have had some benchmarks, but the numbers are not super reliable, because they are… they cannot be run, like, I don't know, 5 times a day, and so, yeah, we just need a bit more time.

423
00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:05.990
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, I would move on… if…

424
00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:08.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: There's no more comments on this topic.

425
00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:13.960
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we have the,

426
00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:27.110
Ansgar Dietrichs: non-core repricing ones, so these are still repricing decisions, but, given that they are not specifically part of this core section, they can really just be treated as individual one-off decisions with no specific,

427
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:45.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: kind of considerations here. So there are… there were two competing proposals for repricings on memory. Initially, there was actually quite a bit of interest in the, first one in that list. I think last call, we even initially talked about it as a potential

428
00:59:45.550 --> 00:59:54.330
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mmm… As a potential CFI candidate or something, but, in the end.

429
00:59:55.190 --> 01:00:03.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think there were some… I'm not blanking, actually, like, one of the two had account abstraction concerns, I think that was 7, 9, 7… wait…

430
01:00:05.250 --> 01:00:06.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Am I…

431
01:00:07.830 --> 01:00:14.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, I think one of them had account obstruction concerns, and in general, it seemed unclear whether there was enough support for either of them, so I just…

432
01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:34.200
Ansgar Dietrichs: given that we need to actually make decisions here, anything that doesn't have a strong yes is basically going to be a default no, so, like, that's… this is why I put both of them as DFI candidates, so do we by now have strong support for either of those two approaches? Otherwise, I think a reform of the memory logic of the EVM would probably be delayed until H star.

433
01:00:43.210 --> 01:00:45.519
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, yes, we no longer have to say H star.

434
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:48.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: Mmm… That's right.

435
01:00:49.360 --> 01:01:02.559
Ansgar Dietrichs: I already forgot what we call it. Hagota. Not Hogota, Hegota. Yeah, exactly. Anyway, so do we have… I, I basically, I, yeah, let's, let's go through them. 7686.

436
01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: Suggestion is DFI?

437
01:01:06.510 --> 01:01:08.970
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does anyone want to argue against DFI?

438
01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: And maybe before we make that decision, then also for the other one, because they're really kind of related,

439
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:35.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: 7923… Are there, if… would anyone oppose a DFI on this one?

440
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:48.180
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay.

441
01:01:48.730 --> 01:01:55.800
Ansgar Dietrichs: Then, I would suggest to just… yeah, then I would say we just DFI both of them.

442
01:01:58.350 --> 01:02:06.460
Ansgar Dietrichs: Again, not because of any specific reason, just because, yeah, we need to make decisions, and default is just DFI on each one, where we don't make CFI decisions.

443
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.750
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then,

444
01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:15.010
Ansgar Dietrichs: We move on. The general repricing sections here, we have, a few more to talk about.

445
01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:27.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: T-store repricing 7971, I think, actually, this is the one that I had in mind initially, but that was… used to be a CFI candidate, but then actually had some account obstruction concerns.

446
01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:33.560
Ansgar Dietrichs: if those, of course, have been addressed, and if by now, people…

447
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:40.940
Ansgar Dietrichs: would want to reconsider this, we could do this. Otherwise, again, just for the… if something is not in its out rule, I would… I marked it as a DFI candidate.

448
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: Does anyone have strong opinions on this one specifically? Ben?

449
01:02:45.170 --> 01:02:52.720
Ben Adams: I mean… It's a shame, not to… not to do it, but… Yeah, they…

450
01:02:53.670 --> 01:02:58.660
Ben Adams: the account abstraction concerns are real. Good.

451
01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.090
Ben Adams: Could I suggest we delay it instead, and see if we can resolve this?

452
01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:08.720
Ansgar Dietrichs: And so, delay would mean until January 5th, do you think?

453
01:03:09.110 --> 01:03:09.480
Ben Adams: yield.

454
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:12.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: that until January 5th, we could, have people look into this more?

455
01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:17.360
Ben Adams: Yes, so if the issues aren't resolved by then, then we get fired.

456
01:03:23.130 --> 01:03:34.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just to answer the question, Dragon, from chat, I think, in general, my understanding at least, is that any EIP that introduces specific hard caps on any individual type of usage

457
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:47.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: into the, into, like, the actual inner execution of a transaction, so not, like, outer, like, say, call data size or something, but the inner part of an execution. It's just problematic, because any

458
01:03:47.410 --> 01:03:50.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: Transaction that bundles the operations of multiple users.

459
01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:55.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: that are shared, basically. Then one user can use up everything up to that cap.

460
01:03:55.960 --> 01:04:18.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then another user's operation would fail because of it. I think that's roughly the type of concern that always comes up on these types of changes, and this is why gas in general is so elegant, because you can check, right? Once one user's operation returns, did they consume… how much gas did they consume? Is there still enough gas left? All these things, so that's a failsafe, but if there's some sort of

461
01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: Secret second counter.

462
01:04:19.730 --> 01:04:32.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: that could also run up, and at some point block the transaction execution further. That really basically breaks all of these use cases that bundles multiple user operations for multiple users. So I think that that is a general type of concern.

463
01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:47.710
draganrakita: Yeah, I think the AIP is unfortunately named because it doesn't just include hard limits. To be honest, hard limits I would remove for that IP, but it reduces some, gas for,

464
01:04:48.460 --> 01:04:55.919
draganrakita: Cars for accessing all the created transition, transient storage, so that part is quite nice.

465
01:04:56.630 --> 01:05:06.329
draganrakita: So yeah, maybe just removing hard limits and leave it for the gas to be a basic limiting factor for transient storage would maybe be a solution for this.

466
01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:15.149
Ben Adams: Yeah, I think… I think the issue, why it has the hard limit is because if it just decreases the gas price of transit storage.

467
01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:17.949
Ben Adams: The amount of memory you can allocate becomes huge.

468
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:28.939
draganrakita: Yeah, but it has different pricing if you increase the trading storage, or when you just access trading storage to just,

469
01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:30.190
draganrakita: Chain.

470
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.510
Ben Adams: Huh.

471
01:05:30.510 --> 01:05:31.990
draganrakita: existing 3D storage.

472
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:33.250
Ben Adams: Different times.

473
01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:40.140
Ben Adams: Maybe just drop the, drop the price for access, but… Keep the storage high.

474
01:05:40.620 --> 01:05:50.659
draganrakita: Yeah, exactly. I think the gas values maybe need to be… they will depend on general repricing that we do.

475
01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:56.230
draganrakita: But in general, yeah, seems like a nice AIP.

476
01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.680
draganrakita: We… from red side, we mark it as neutral, so it depends, do we have, like.

477
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.730
draganrakita: Do you want to close it or not?

478
01:06:05.380 --> 01:06:09.389
draganrakita: It's different mechanism, so it's not just repricing group, sorry.

479
01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:22.249
Ansgar Dietrichs: No, no, yeah, that's fine. But then I would maybe suggest, indeed, that we follow with Ben's proposal and just delay, one more time until January 5th, because it seems like people would still like to include this in general if we can find a way to make it safe.

480
01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:33.729
Ansgar Dietrichs: But also, that, of course, means the understanding should be that the default here will be DFI. So on January 5th, unless we have a way to resolve all open questions, it will be DFI, but people want to give it one more round of chance, basically.

481
01:06:34.130 --> 01:06:45.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: One more chance. Okay, so then delayed decision on 7971, and then we move on to, 7973, warm account right metering,

482
01:06:45.530 --> 01:06:55.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: This one is, a DFI candidate, just because it basically was kind of one of those middling EIPs, not much support, not much opposition,

483
01:06:55.730 --> 01:06:59.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: Which makes it a default DFI, anyone that wants to oppose DFI here.

484
01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:13.460
draganrakita: Just to add comment, this kind of logic we already have for S-Store, basically for storage.

485
01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:18.950
draganrakita: And basically, it is some kind of optimization when we want to…

486
01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:25.320
draganrakita: Increased balance for account that's already scheduled to be… not scheduled, but…

487
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:29.909
draganrakita: Increasing the balance two times, second balance is going to be cheaper.

488
01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:38.360
draganrakita: So, from our side, it's marked as neutral, because it depends if there is room to include it or not.

489
01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:47.219
draganrakita: I don't have any concerns on AIP in general, but more on the… if you have scope for it.

490
01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:03.520
Ansgar Dietrichs: That doesn't sound like a passionate CFI argument, so then I would stick with DFI here.

491
01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:24.629
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then, DFI on this one. Then we have one more in the section, EIP8032. This is the size-based storage gas pricing. This one does not have a recommendation, either CFI or DFI, because, it was quite controversial on

492
01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:38.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: the last call with some people concerned about the overhead. On the other hand, it had some… quite a bit of initial support, and so I know Guillaume is on the call to talk about it some more, and then we can see whether we want to make a decision on this today.

493
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:40.240
Guillaume: Yeah,

494
01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:57.849
Guillaume: So, okay, I didn't, like, you told me we're not going to talk about it today, so I don't have any presentation. I did publish the Twitter thread explaining the transition part of it yesterday, so glad I did this. Please have a look if you're wondering how the transition would work.

495
01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:13.089
Guillaume: Yeah, I did, I did watch the rerun, I was on holiday last time. I would like to address the two comments I heard that were, in my view, completely wrong. One of them is that…

496
01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:29.990
Guillaume: It's redundant with AT38, I think, or 8037, I forgot which one. That is completely not true, because AT38 or 8037, I guess it's 8037, has to do with the state growth in general.

497
01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:47.199
Guillaume: Whereas, this one has to target, is only intended to target the one contract that is, causing a huge scalability issue, especially in REST. So that's not…

498
01:09:47.490 --> 01:10:00.430
Guillaume: that's not the same thing at all. Regarding the transition, like I said, I did a thread, the Twitter thread yesterday, so please have a look at it. But it's very simple.

499
01:10:00.580 --> 01:10:19.579
Guillaume: if, if you can do, something as… like, if you can handle an iterator, which everybody in this, in this chat should be able to, I think, it's… it's exactly what it is. It's just about iterating the stat, the state, and adding a new, a new counter to the…

500
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.560
Guillaume: to the account. So, there's…

501
01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:41.610
Guillaume: I mean, there's always risk, of course, but if you compare it to something like the vertical transition, which, which is itself… which in itself was tested and validated and well-specified, we… it's… it's really… it's really much, much simpler.

502
01:10:41.610 --> 01:10:46.629
Guillaume: I am, of course, happy to answer any questions about this.

503
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:55.590
Guillaume: But I think, we should CFI this one, and the reason we should CFI this one is because this is having a negative impact

504
01:10:55.590 --> 01:11:06.700
Guillaume: on the network, and, sorry, the Xen construct in particular is having a negative impact on the scalability of the network, and if you want to disincentivize.

505
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:15.570
Guillaume: Disincentivize, you know, touching this contract, which is, which is dragging everybody down.

506
01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:20.560
Guillaume: you don't have a better option, than this, because once again, AT37,

507
01:11:20.870 --> 01:11:31.859
Guillaume: solves a lot of problems, but doesn't address this one in particular. Yep, I think that's all I have to say. If there are questions, happy to answer them.

508
01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:34.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: Ben?

509
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:42.749
Ben Adams: Not to, rousing speech, but I would suggest delaying this one so we can consider.

510
01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:44.020
Ben Adams: The new input.

511
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:47.689
Guillaume: What new input are you looking for?

512
01:11:48.270 --> 01:11:51.179
Ben Adams: Oh, you… you… that you've just prepared.

513
01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.940
Ben Adams: Because I doubt anybody's read it.

514
01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:54.850
Ben Adams: Fully.

515
01:11:55.390 --> 01:11:57.309
Guillaume: Oh, you mean this right? Okay, sure, yeah.

516
01:12:02.270 --> 01:12:08.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: Matt and chat, no delay would not mean CFI. Delay would mean making the CFI decision on January 5th.

517
01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.620
Ben Adams: Yeah.

518
01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.059
lightclient: Doesn't CF… does not… does CFI not mean that we are considering…

519
01:12:21.240 --> 01:12:25.110
lightclient: Including it. And we're looking for more information.

520
01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:26.900
lightclient: It's not good.

521
01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:30.020
Ben Adams: We're cons… we're considering, considering including.

522
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:40.010
lightclient: I don't know, I feel like if we're trying to go through all of these EAPs… CFI…

523
01:12:40.650 --> 01:12:43.379
lightclient: Matches what we're looking for here.

524
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:53.170
Łukasz Rozmej: I have a question, so the potential downside here would be that if we have, like,

525
01:12:54.720 --> 01:13:02.960
Łukasz Rozmej: archive sync that is replaying everything from the beginning, it has to go explicitly through this migration every time, right?

526
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:04.750
Łukasz Rozmej: Yep.

527
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.900
Łukasz Rozmej: Previous and the next.

528
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:16.799
Guillaume: Absolutely. So, this is… I mean, this is in consensus, right? The iterator pointers are stored in a system contract.

529
01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.750
Guillaume: So you…

530
01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:37.140
Guillaume: you have… it's… yeah, it's part of the consensus, you do have to replay them, and but this is just… unlike the vertical transition, this is just iterating the… what we call the snapshot, or the flat DB, so, this is something that, over a full sync.

531
01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:51.319
Guillaume: Would take about 30 minutes extra, 30 extra minutes, which, if your full sync is, just as hours, is, just a drop, over the course of a full re-execution.

532
01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:17.370
Łukasz Rozmej: Okay, I still… I'm afraid this might be too complex, for the scope. I think everything touching the tree is really, really complex, and very error-prone. Maybe not complex from the design perspective, or from the implementation and testing, too.

533
01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:25.820
Łukasz Rozmej: It is doable, I agree that this is doable, I'm just unsure about if it's not…

534
01:14:26.310 --> 01:14:28.710
Łukasz Rozmej: Too complex to… to…

535
01:14:31.270 --> 01:14:37.660
Łukasz Rozmej: to do it, right? It would be different if we were to have this at the beginning, but during that migration, I'm not convinced yet.

536
01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:56.700
Guillaume: I mean, yeah, there's only one, you know, if you… if it feels complex to you, I can only… you know, I can't really tell you anything, for just feelings, like, I'm happy to take some time, you know, aside and discuss it, and…

537
01:14:56.750 --> 01:15:04.269
Guillaume: and, you know, try to change your mind, but, if you're just telling me it feels complex, I… I can't,

538
01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:06.220
Guillaume: you know, I can't…

539
01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:30.079
Guillaume: say anything that's gonna change your mind. Yes, touching the state is complex, in a way, but this is something that has been tested, that has been done by Guess and Baesu. NetherMind was more or less on the… close enough to doing it. I think Somnat did something like that for Aragon. Actually, not sure, I should check with him. But, it's not like it's completely…

540
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:47.420
Guillaume: misunderstood by everybody. Every client… okay, most clients have done something similar for the vertical testnet, so it's not like, yeah, it's not like it's, it hasn't been done before, and and…

541
01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:55.730
Guillaume: Yeah, okay. All I can offer is, let's talk, let's talk, and let me, let me show you, how it would be done.

542
01:16:00.810 --> 01:16:01.730
Ansgar Dietrichs: So then…

543
01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:12.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: just to… in the interest of, like, moving on for today, I'd rather keep these, like, last few remaining discussion points for January 5th, so we can have that call just for a few.

544
01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: more in-depth discussions, I would propose to then delay their decision on this one, given that there doesn't seem to be a clear…

545
01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:22.250
Ansgar Dietrichs: Clear agreement on either side yet?

546
01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:35.550
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then let's move on. We have a few more topics to go through, and we still have 18 more minutes.

547
01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:55.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: We have, the contract section, first specifically allowing for larger contracts. So, the situation there is that we have two competing EAPs that both basically aim to allow for larger contracts. One is 2926 chunk-based code localization, and the other one is

548
01:16:55.050 --> 01:17:07.060
Ansgar Dietrichs: 7907. Basically, it would not make sense to include both. We could basically choose to include one of the two, or not do any of them, and basically, revisit this for the next fork.

549
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:17.770
Ansgar Dietrichs: The reason I specifically marked, one of them as DFI candidate is not necessarily a personal preference, it's just specifically due to the fact that,

550
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:26.950
Ansgar Dietrichs: In terms of, prior discussion, there was pretty strong opposition, by… by several clients,

551
01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:38.299
Ansgar Dietrichs: to 2926, but it was actually quite controversial, so we could… yeah. I just wanted to open this discussion back up. 2926 or 7907?

552
01:17:39.070 --> 01:17:40.130
Ansgar Dietrichs: Guillaume?

553
01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:57.159
Guillaume: Yeah, I'm actually quite surprised that you say there was strong opposition, because I did present it twice, and I don't remember any opposition whatsoever. Could be, you know, could be that I don't remember, but, yeah, I'd like to know who has,

554
01:17:57.160 --> 01:18:08.989
Guillaume: who has, who is strongly in opposition to this. I would say, of, between AT32 and 2926, if I had to pick one, I would pick AT32.

555
01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:22.629
Guillaume: The reason why we want 2926 is because it does address the prover killers, and it solves the code size limit in one swoop.

556
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:41.869
Guillaume: It's pretty simple. It's aligned with the state growth EIPs that we want to do. It provides a consistent access cost to code, just like it does… when I say access, I mean both read and write, something that is not as

557
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:52.870
Guillaume: awkward as the one proposed in 7907. In my understanding, the people that were working on 7907

558
01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:58.239
Guillaume: gave up on, on this, on this CAP, I could be wrong, but that's, that was my understanding.

559
01:18:59.130 --> 01:19:11.430
Guillaume: Okay, you didn't, alright? Matt did, if he hasn't changed his mind, and I think, could be wrong, don't want to put words in his mouth. I think Dragon did too.

560
01:19:12.250 --> 01:19:21.190
Guillaume: Okay, what I wanted to add is, yeah, like, the 2926 is… future-proof?

561
01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:38.599
Guillaume: it's solving a lot of problems in one go. It's pretty simple. Wukash will probably disagree with that, but that's my take on it. And I think 7907 is instant tech debt, so even if you DFI

562
01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:51.409
Guillaume: chunk-based mercilization, I would say also DFI7907, because, it's, in my view, it's a big, it's a big mistake to do… I mean, okay, it's not a big mistake, but it's going to be instant take that.

563
01:19:56.410 --> 01:19:59.219
Charles: I don't even think they're fundamentally incompatible.

564
01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:05.360
Ansgar Dietrichs: Ben?

565
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:13.949
Ben Adams: Yeah, so 7907, we dropped that from Fusaka, but that was because…

566
01:20:14.220 --> 01:20:19.009
Ben Adams: I mean, it was very late in the fork, and there were complications with it, which I don't…

567
01:20:19.970 --> 01:20:30.339
Ben Adams: So the solution for that is adding the length to the account, which was, like, too big a change for Usaca, whereas I think for Gramsterdam, it's… it's fine.

568
01:20:36.770 --> 01:20:37.320
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right.

569
01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:38.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: Greg?

570
01:20:40.270 --> 01:20:52.000
Greg K  | Lido: Yeah, so, from my side, yeah, just going to share that, like I also shared in the PR that, like, in light internally would segment with those two IPs,

571
01:20:52.230 --> 01:21:02.029
Greg K  | Lido: it seems to us that 7, 907 is simpler, and TIR supposed to text on the PR,

572
01:21:02.100 --> 01:21:16.830
Greg K  | Lido: My main point is, like, it's important to increase the code size limit, so the option to neither of them is too bad. Like, there is really need for this, like, also from the kind of lighter contacts, but I think in general for apps.

573
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:29.900
Greg K  | Lido: And, you know, developers, it's required to have this increase, so one of them at least, should be CFI'd, in my opinion. Yeah, and the reason that, we think that 7907 is

574
01:21:30.730 --> 01:21:44.210
Greg K  | Lido: appropriate, is that it simpler that it's much more clean, in the sense that it says… it sets a specific cap of 48 kilobytes, and, it's kind of more pragmatic short-term solution. So, if…

575
01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:54.089
Greg K  | Lido: this is wrong that, so let's say client teams believe that it's more complex than, the other solution, then that's fine.

576
01:21:54.230 --> 01:22:08.279
Greg K  | Lido: Because, 2926 seems more kind of future-proof, like, it's… it does a bigger change that is, more important for the stateless client's future and stuff like that. So, it's not that we are against DCAP,

577
01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:29.429
Greg K  | Lido: for some reason, it just seemed to us that 7907 does the job of, you know, doubling the maximum contract size without having so big complexity, and yeah, as Ben said, like, it was, I mean, ideally, it should have been already in Fusaka, it's kind of delayed, but now, like, it seemed to us that

578
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:32.079
Greg K  | Lido: it's, it's not so hard to be part of Amsterdam.

579
01:22:36.390 --> 01:22:37.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you.

580
01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:53.489
Guillaume: Yeah, just wanted to say, yes, it's definitely simple, 7907 is definitely simpler in the short term. It's going to be a lot more complicated in the long term, because, you do have a very, a very,

581
01:22:53.490 --> 01:23:16.989
Guillaume: You know, like, you have an asymmetric, management of the code, so that means that compilers will try to put, to optimize the code in such a way to… to put as much code as they can in the best, in the free part of the code, and then you're going to have a lot of special gas golfing.

582
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:22.590
Guillaume: approaches. I think in the past, we… we always,

583
01:23:22.590 --> 01:23:46.379
Guillaume: found out that the more, you know, people try to work around the limits when it comes to gas, to gas accounting. So, so I don't think… I think we're opening, we're opening a Panera's box, and that's the… that's the point of 2926. We are, just making a consistent, like, the… the cost is the same from chunk zero to chunk, 1 billion. You do…

584
01:23:46.470 --> 01:24:09.120
Guillaume: you do remove the code size limit right off the bat, so it's not, like, doubling. The other problem of 7907 is that it doesn't solve the problem that if you need even one byte of the code, you have to load the entire 64 kilobytes, if that's 64 kilobytes, and that's…

585
01:24:09.460 --> 01:24:21.699
Guillaume: that's, yeah, so it's not addressing a lot of the problems we know. When it comes to the code size, both AIPs just added to the account header, so that part doesn't change.

586
01:24:24.950 --> 01:24:29.780
Ben Adams: Yeah, so, I mean, they both introduce a change to the account of adding the length

587
01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:41.620
Ben Adams: And then in 7907, it does sort of address it, in that, yeah, you will need to load the full 64 kilobytes, but you… you pay additional.

588
01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.200
Ben Adams: We're loading that.

589
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:47.769
Ben Adams: So, I mean, I see it as a pragmatic first step.

590
01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:55.359
Ben Adams: Because, it's… what it does to the account tries is the same in both VIPs, so…

591
01:24:55.490 --> 01:25:00.859
Ben Adams: I don't see it as, necessarily incompatible.

592
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:07.750
Guillaume: Well, in the case of 2926, you actually add a new tree inside the main tree, so it does more.

593
01:25:08.530 --> 01:25:16.460
Ben Adams: Yeah, yeah, but I mean, they… they've… they both have the same first step, which is adding a code… code length to the account, so…

594
01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:19.300
Ben Adams: That's the same change, and then…

595
01:25:19.970 --> 01:25:24.189
Ben Adams: The additional is just gas pricing and… A higher limit.

596
01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:44.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right. So, this seems like a tricky situation. We have, pretty passionate and strong support by two… well, by at least,

597
01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:51.089
Ansgar Dietrichs: the GATP and, and, and Guillum, within that for, for the, for 29… 26.

598
01:25:51.340 --> 01:26:00.370
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then we have, at least 3 clients currently that are more leaning towards DFI on this one.

599
01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:10.760
Ansgar Dietrichs: But then also we don't have strong, like, like, clear, unified support for 7907 as an alternative either, so how do we…

600
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.969
Ansgar Dietrichs: Best actually make progress here towards a decision.

601
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:25.020
draganrakita: Didn't we talk about 20… that we don't want 2926 in this fork?

602
01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.710
draganrakita: But we didn't talk, do we want 7907.

603
01:26:30.930 --> 01:26:36.629
Guillaume: When did we talk about this? I completely… if that happened, I'd like to… I'd like to be informed.

604
01:26:37.230 --> 01:26:41.750
draganrakita: Asgard's mentioned in the chat, there are 3 clients that are

605
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:47.379
draganrakita: They went to DFI2926, Bezu, Aragon, and Red.

606
01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:49.640
Guillaume: Yeah, just to clarify.

607
01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:50.560
draganrakita: Thought.

608
01:26:50.730 --> 01:27:10.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, let me briefly clarify. So, we had, several, two occasions so far where people have voiced opinions on these EIPs. One was the phase, the asynchronous phase, where all clients wrote preference documents. Out of those preference documents, we had,

609
01:27:10.770 --> 01:27:28.139
Ansgar Dietrichs: for 2926 in particular, we actually had both Geth and NetherMind signaling A on this, so this was indeed support on the CRP, and then we had Beisu listing it as DFI, which was a separate category that they invented beyond ABCD,

610
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:47.570
Ansgar Dietrichs: S, A, B, C, and D, just for, the Purith and for the CAP. And then we had, Aragon also listed, with an X emoji. They only differentiated between X emoji and checkmark emoji, and this one… and question mark emoji, and this one was an X emoji for…

611
01:27:47.650 --> 01:27:49.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: For Aragon.

612
01:27:50.140 --> 01:28:03.430
Ansgar Dietrichs: And since we had one synchronous discussion, this was two calls ago, actually, so last call we didn't get to this, so two calls ago, when we went through the very first round of discussing all EIPs.

613
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:19.469
Ansgar Dietrichs: In that first round of discussion, it was controversial, where Aragon specifically… sorry, sorry, where Geth, expressed support. Aragon expressed, to not do this ahead of tree changes, and Nethermind had some concerns around it being expensive.

614
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:33.639
Ansgar Dietrichs: And then Reth specifically expressed concerns about it being too complex, and also today, again, in chat, expressed, leaning towards DFI. So these are all the ways in which clients have so far expressed positions on the CFP. Does that clarify where we're at?

615
01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:53.589
Guillaume: Yeah, I mean, regarding the Aragon one, which, indeed, did the same comment last time, my answer was, like, are you really going to do a… are you going to… are you ready to support a tree change in, H-star, or whatever it's called, Hogota? Are you ready to do this?

616
01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:02.600
Guillaume: Because otherwise, you're not gonna have, you're not gonna have a tree change anyway, so…

617
01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:12.909
Guillaume: that's the whole point of the CIP. Assume that tree change, is not going to happen for a few years, and we still need

618
01:29:13.070 --> 01:29:20.159
Guillaume: the code chunking, anyway. So… Yeah, just.

619
01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:20.610
Ansgar Dietrichs: So…

620
01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:20.960
Guillaume: I, I'.

621
01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:34.020
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, I mean, I understand the situation here. The question is just, Guillaume, look, again, it's at least 3 clients, I don't know how to count Nethermind, but basically, like, at least 3 clients currently leaning towards DFI. I'm just…

622
01:29:34.030 --> 01:29:45.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: I personally, of course, wouldn't mind letting this decision until January 5th, it just, right now, doesn't look like that would actually change anything, and the default decision right now is DFI, obviously. We can't include something where 3 clients

623
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.349
Ansgar Dietrichs: are on DFI. So unless you specifically think you have high chances of convincing people.

624
01:29:50.590 --> 01:29:56.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: between now and January 5th, I personally don't really see how we could not make the DFI decision today.

625
01:29:56.700 --> 01:29:57.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: If that makes sense.

626
01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:10.019
Guillaume: No, it doesn't. I mean, you make a decision last time without, you know, me being present to defend it. It's, yeah, like…

627
01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:23.309
Guillaume: this, this is the first time I hear about, about the DFI, okay, so I met two times ago, I was there last time. Yeah, like.

628
01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.630
Guillaume: Once again, if I address… Every argument made.

629
01:30:29.590 --> 01:30:33.909
Guillaume: There should be some time for people to think about it and at least change their minds.

630
01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:39.040
Guillaume: You, like, so far, that's exactly what I said about 1832.

631
01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:44.209
Guillaume: It's all about feelings. Oh, I feel it's too complex, da-da-da. Yeah, okay.

632
01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:52.989
Guillaume: I want actual points. If you have actual points, then fine. We DFI it. I do not see any points being made.

633
01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:59.669
Charles: I have a question, which is that there… is there consensus that, there are no,

634
01:31:00.530 --> 01:31:10.820
Charles: let's see, technical drawbacks, like, I'm wondering if there's any issues with code locality, and I've also discussed this with some other developers, because every chunk needs to be looked up.

635
01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:22.139
Guillaume: Yeah, okay, sure. I mean, no, there isn't more, you have a different type of code locality in 7907, but…

636
01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:32.079
Guillaume: Yeah, you load a piece of code, you need to jump to a different location, you pay for a different thing, but it's 31 bytes, so…

637
01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:37.590
Guillaume: Your leeway to actually do code locality is going to be very limited.

638
01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:46.430
Charles: That's what I'm saying, like, every time… every 32 bytes, the execution client needs to look up the next chunk.

639
01:31:47.950 --> 01:31:58.540
Guillaume: Yeah, and, every… every 64, every, 24 bytes, kilobytes, you're gonna have to do the same thing. You're gonna be loading every… yeah, it's the same thing.

640
01:31:58.540 --> 01:31:59.060
Ansgar Dietrichs: So…

641
01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:17.070
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, just… because again, like, this is not… I don't personally have strong opinion. I actually really, in some way, really would want larger contracts in the EVM sooner rather than later. I think that's actually a quite desirable feature, but I don't really have super strong opinions myself on this. I'm really just trying to synthesize client positions here. I just think…

642
01:32:17.500 --> 01:32:27.569
Ansgar Dietrichs: in order to ever CFI anything, we would have, basically, like, all clients be willing to at least give up their veto, and probably most clients support it. We are pretty far for…

643
01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:40.870
Ansgar Dietrichs: from that status, that's not a good or bad thing, that is just the description of where we are today. So, unless, specifically, the three clients that are on the, kind of, opposition list, Aragon, Rath, Besu.

644
01:32:40.870 --> 01:32:49.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: Would specifically all signal to… or, like, at least two of them would signal right now that they would at least be open to changing their mind.

645
01:32:49.790 --> 01:32:59.109
Ansgar Dietrichs: by January 5th. I think, just process-wise, there's not really much of a choice other than to make a DFI decision. And I really would not want to carry this on over into

646
01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:03.329
Ansgar Dietrichs: January 5th, unless, again, there's a specific reason for that, Lukash.

647
01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:16.959
Łukasz Rozmej: I have two questions. One, was this, prototype anywhere, and does this prototype have, potential performance problems? Because now you're loading code, potentially.

648
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:24.220
Łukasz Rozmej: You're loading code as you do load state, which can create heavy latency issues.

649
01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:33.709
Łukasz Rozmej: It can be probably mitigated with preloading it, or still keeping, this code also, by hash, and just loading it all, and just…

650
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:38.459
Łukasz Rozmej: Going through memory. But yeah, there are some questions around that.

651
01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.720
Łukasz Rozmej: Hmm… website.

652
01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:42.250
Guillaume: What's the second question?

653
01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:55.609
Łukasz Rozmej: Was this prototype, and does this prototype handle any performance degradation potential here? Because this is kind of loading on the code on demand, and if we actually do this while executing.

654
01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:08.969
Łukasz Rozmej: we will probably blow up execution times by loading code a lot from database, and so it needs to be handled better, in my opinion, to… in practice, right? In theory, we might

655
01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:13.420
Łukasz Rozmej: Keep this… this,

656
01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:24.130
Łukasz Rozmej: You know, the schema of trunking, but in practice, we probably want to preload a lot of code, or a whole code, when we execute it.

657
01:34:24.680 --> 01:34:34.719
Guillaume: So, regarding the first question, and I know we're at time, so I'm gonna try to be quick. Has it been prototyped? Yes and no? It's been prototyped inside Verko.

658
01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:50.130
Guillaume: I didn't bother implementing it, because I figured, the bad decision was likely to be made, and my time is unfortunately limited. Regarding the loading.

659
01:34:50.130 --> 01:35:00.999
Guillaume: I would expect, I mean, yes, if you start, if you start loading it chunk by chunk, like, actual chunk by actual chunk, it will probably be, much slower.

660
01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:10.550
Guillaume: This being said, I expect you would be putting coach chunks in pages, so… so the limit, like, the performance hit.

661
01:35:10.830 --> 01:35:27.079
Guillaume: I'm expecting are much lower than that. But if, yeah, okay. I could implement it, I just need to have the assurance that at least there's a chance that it's, that it's worth it. So, yeah, I'm still waiting for… Yeah.

662
01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:37.479
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, then… and again, like, I'm sorry, I'm really not trying to be confrontational here, just trying to, like, move the process along. So, like, I would then briefly go through

663
01:35:37.700 --> 01:35:45.620
Ansgar Dietrichs: If we, you know, two more minutes here, and see if there's still people from these… from the clients here, and they can indicate whether they are open to

664
01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:49.900
Ansgar Dietrichs: you know, having their mind changed by January 5th, or whether that's hopeless, so…

665
01:35:50.000 --> 01:36:00.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: say, starting with, RETH, do we think… from the RETH side, do we think this is a soft no, or a hard no? Like, what's… what's the… what is the take on this EAP?

666
01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:07.349
draganrakita: internal, deifying it for Glamsterdam.

667
01:36:08.970 --> 01:36:13.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, and for… from Bezo, do we have anyone still on the call?

668
01:36:13.380 --> 01:36:28.569
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yeah, we're still in the DFI camp. We like this a lot better with other state tree changes. We're not opposed to it on its own, but we do think that it should wait for a time when other state changes are going in as well. Or, sorry, tree changes are going in as well.

669
01:36:29.710 --> 01:36:31.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: And Aragon?

670
01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:57.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, if we don't have anyone from Aragon anymore on the call, then, yeah, I would say, for process reasons, we… like, it doesn't seem like there is room for clients to be convinced here, and without client agreement, we just simply cannot include this in the fork.

671
01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:05.659
Ansgar Dietrichs: So, again, there's not… not as a personal decision, just as… just following the process here, I think it seems clear that this is a DFI decision today.

672
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:07.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: M…

673
01:37:08.670 --> 01:37:13.469
Guillaume: Okay, can we have the quick DFI decision about 7907, then?

674
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:23.440
Ansgar Dietrichs: I don't think we are over time already, because we took so long for this decision. I assume this is probably where that one is headed as well, but then we will have to wait for this until the continuation on January 5th.

675
01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.749
Ansgar Dietrichs: We did not discuss this today yet.

676
01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:35.140
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then… So, just to…

677
01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:49.619
Ansgar Dietrichs: repeat DFI on 2926, and decision delayed until January 5th, 7907, not specifically because this one needs more time, just because this is the cutoff of process where we got to today.

678
01:37:49.630 --> 01:38:01.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: So this is the continuation. The plan for, January 5th will be to just continue with the remaining list first, and then get back to the few open questions that we had, and hopefully have time to go in depth there.

679
01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.810
Ansgar Dietrichs: Thank you, everyone.

680
01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:12.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: And we're really getting very close to having the scope finalized. Thank you. Have, happy holidays, Merry Christmas, and talk to you all next year.

681
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:16.070
Marius van der Wijden: Bye-bye.

682
01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:16.800
Łukasz Rozmej: Bye.

683
01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:17.650
Greg K  | Lido: Bye.

684
01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.170
Fredrik: consultant.

685
01:38:19.170 --> 01:38:19.710
lightclient: Merry Christmas.

686
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:20.820
jochem-brouwer: I agree.
