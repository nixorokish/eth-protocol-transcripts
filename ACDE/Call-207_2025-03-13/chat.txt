option D seems like the fastest way to non-finality testing on mainnet
00:13:34	Sergei Iakovlev | P2P.org:	We also prefer plan D for short-term, we heavly relay on exits (fee splitter with some third-party like EL).

00:15:37	Barnabas:	How about we combine A + D? We launch a new network and yolo holesky with D?

00:15:53	Matt Nelson:	Solves short term
00:15:54	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "How about we combine..."

Yeah, I think if we do (D) we should shut down Holesky shortly after Pectrra
00:15:57	pari,marius&gballet:	Replying to "what is the time dif..."

Id assume it’ll be 3-4 weeks before A is fully up to speed

And again lon non-finality if not everyone will upgrade?
00:17:22	Sergei Iakovlev | P2P.org:	Replying to "How about we combi..."

we can do A for long-term, because there are also third-parties needed to be there like SAFE, SSV, EigenLayer and so on
But anyway we need something to test before mainnet and use for that pland D
After Pectra in mainnet just to move to a new testnet which will be maybe already ready

it's an argument for both, because i'm not sure how usefull a long lived D is to Fusaka.

unfortunately, i don’t know
00:18:20	lightclient:	Replying to "what is the time dif..."

and how long for D?
00:18:27	pk910:	Option D is basically a testnet only hardfork.
That's a irregular state change to update the exit_epoch of all exiting validator set..
00:18:40	lightclient:	I feel like we shouldn’t do another hard fork to Holesky
00:18:50	lightclient:	especially if it isn’t trivial
00:19:00	pari,marius&gballet:	Replying to "what is the time dif..."

00:19:32	Kamil Chodoła:	+1 to Daniel's point.

00:19:43	Matt Nelson:	Im not sure about that
00:20:17	jochem-brouwer (EthJS):	I dont think we should implement a testnet-only hardfork
00:20:47	sean:	If we re-use fork version maybe it won’t be as bad
00:21:07	Gajinder Singh:	separate branch could work only if holesky is to be run for 2-3 months
00:21:07	protolambda:	Did we already max out the current churn limit, to accelerate validator exits?
00:21:27	pari,marius&gballet:	Replying to "separate branch coul..."

I think that would be the idea with D
00:21:43	Prada | Diva Staking:	We need to test pectra exits, so definitely cleaning up the exit queue or having a functional testnet with exits at a reasonable time is essential for us. We are ok with D + A. Whatever is faster and produces the least amount of headaches, but at the same time is stable on the long run.
00:21:58	Barnabas:	Replying to "Did we already max o..."

churn limit is 8, it would take 600d to dequeue the 1M validators
00:21:59	Sergei Iakovlev | P2P.org:	but if there will be a new testnet, I understand it right, that Pectra on mainnet will be AFTER this testnet will be ready + 1month to test?

00:24:20	nflaig:	D with a custom code fork we just use on holesky + using an epoch instead of full fork to trigger the change could maybe work and be simple?

00:24:43	Kirill M:	how much time will Holesky live after possible option D before the transition to option A (new testnet)? 
00:25:22	Barnabas:	Replying to "how much time will H..."

this can be done parallel
00:25:53	Gajinder Singh:	Replying to "how much time will H..."

only long enough to test pectra exits
00:26:03	Kamil Chodoła:	Isn't shadowfork solve the exit queue issue?
I guess I miss something but we remain the EL state, it could be fast and we could keep it withotu spawning new testnet?

So, is old Hive now fully Pectra compatible? I say this because the EEST tests, and consume-rlp tests have done poorly on detecting many crucial issues on Erigon, and I used to rely on Kurtosis tests, but they have been finicky too recently. Thanks.

01:05:12	Ivan Metrikin:	If we go for A, we’d need a few weeks to deploy all Lido-related functionality and tools. And after that is done, we’ll need time to test the actual functionality (both new Pectra things and make sure that the “old” stuff works)  which adds a few weeks on top. So, probably 2 months in total from the moment we have the new testnet available
