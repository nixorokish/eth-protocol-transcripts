Have we been in the position before where we've announced mainnet versions and then had to rollback?

The Eips idea is good but there are many open questions left and many problems
The main problems with the eip rn are 
Database how to persist
reorg handling for filter maps
Proof format still in progress

network sync protocol missing

Hard to gauge on aggregation, like on every single release, we have huge changes that could have been avoided on our side if we had forward compatible or stable containers, at each given fork they probably don't offset other EIPs, but we've now paid the price for at least 4 forks
01:03:32	Marc:	Replying to "I kinda disagree wit…"
the motivation isn’t really allowing apps to support some new functionality- they can already do the same stuff today just not in a future-proof way. it’s just trying to give one less thing to worry about when changing slot length

IMO we definitely need to bring in how clients load bytecode from DB into the protocol spec at some stage. Currently there’s no concept of it, as far protocol goes only contract hash exists and it complicates increasing contract limits. The question is whether to do it now or later.

we already have deterministic factory contracts via unprotected / nickmined TXs? A standard would be great,  but is it worth spendeing dev effort on it - we won't really have a benefit out of it as we preactically already have a non standard way to do the same?

The price won’t go down 1000x with re-pricings. What is needed is either cheap small math ops (16 bit) or vector operations.

Also, I haven’t seen zkEVMs running the RV vector ops yet. Is ther eone I should be looking at?

We still need a way to coordinate on everyone implementing them though. E.g. for sparse blobpool, we do kind of need all clients to do it in a timely way, if we think it’s important, otherwise we can’t get any benefits from it (unless we’re ok with just saying that if you run a client that hasn’t implemented it you’ll need more bandwidth)

zkEVM will need to support some kind of quantum sigs, so having precompile for it makes sense

01:25:51	Marc:	Replying to "I am also strongly a…"
I don’t see it being a big issue, the tx index is specified up front so you can put these txs at top of block before building the rest
01:26:24	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "+1 for not including..."

I am quite skeptical about this, for one thing (like potuz mentions) it is not resilient to 51% attacks, which is not the security model of L2s. Also reducing challenge windows isn’t just about censorship (it’s not even clear that it’s the most important thing)
