00:17:37	Ansgar Dietrichs:	the different optimizations target different operations:
state writes: parallel state root calculation
state reads: batch reads
compute: parallel execution

so if we launch the fork without any of these supported, that specific type of operation would have to be more expensive
00:18:21	Jared Wasinger:	Geth will have batch io by the time devnet 2 launches

00:27:30	Csaba:	Replying to "if specific optimiza..."

It feels strange to me to mandate specific implementation details, instead of mandating performance requirements.
00:27:34	Toni Wahrstätter:	There could be the 10 MiB RLP size limit (if we don't put the calldata repricing in too). But we can avoid hitting it by just not spamming big-calldata blocks

Which EIP is this? For some reason I can't find it
00:28:44	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "if specific optimiza..."

Agree with Csaba, they should be described as possible optimizations and we do the benchmarking on optimized clients but in the end, clients are free to optimize how they want and if you get to the same speed as other clients without parallism, fine :)

00:29:24	Francesco:	Replying to "if specific optimiza..."

Well, as long as you don’t do it by e.g. doing it optimistically instead of using the BAL, which won’t deal with the worst case
00:29:50	Francesco:	Replying to "if specific optimiza..."

Performance requirements have to be defined quite strictly
00:30:48	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "We need the new et..."

Yup, thanks :)

I thought this was already proposed for Glamsterdam. Does it need to be shipped with a hf? Technically not right, eth/70 is somewhat opt-in, but mandatory once we raise gas limit above that 10 MB receipt threshold
00:31:28	vitalik:	I don't like this because it makes "is empty" part of the de facto storage interface
00:31:52	vitalik:	imo we should keep the storage interface ro a clean get(key), set(key, val)
00:32:06	Csaba:	Replying to "if specific optimiza..."

I agree, it should be strict. It should be on worst case, and on specific test cases. But “having implemented a vaguely defined technique” is I think worse in many ways.

1: BALs could be generated by the next builder, but yes, there’s a brief time in which they are not available
2: yes, but key providers could listen to attestation and only release when they see enough of them. Also, via the key vlaidation function, they can make keys only valid for a single slot, in order to prevent replaying the (now decrypted) transaction

01:20:08	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "Three things to disc..."

Without BALs, these transactions cannot be executed under parallelisation guarantees correct?

I don’t think this is an issue for frontrunning protection which is the main goal, only for censorship resistance. And for these cases, the gas payer does not have to be the same address as the payload signer, so there can be relayers or some other misdirection
