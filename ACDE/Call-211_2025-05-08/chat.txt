Not for end-users running their own node and being self sovereign.
00:18:02	Barnabas:	50M gas requires 16GB+ machines
peerdas on its own without bumping the blob limit also requires 16GB+ ram machines. 

The two together might require 32GB ram machines. (even for devnets!, thats a HUGE increase in RAM requirements.
00:18:04	Justin Florentine (Besu):	your wallet
00:18:44	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "60M is already a str..."

with which aspect of state growth being the biggest concern? disk requirements? db performance?
00:18:49	Sophia Gold:	Replying to "50M gas requires 1..."

Aren't we currently recommending 32gb for validators?
00:19:15	Barnabas:	Replying to "50M gas requires 16G..."

yes, thats the problem. With large state we might need to start recommending 64 or even 128gb ram.
00:19:19	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "60M is already a str..."

there are other bottlenecks like snap sync healing phase duration, but that degrades as a function of state change rate, not state growth rate
00:19:24	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "60M is already a str..."

maybe state sync is biggest concern, but I think the ceiling is > 60M

But you need data to know what your implementation can and cannot support. Such that you know what to improve.

 You're ignoring the installed base, which is mostly 2TB. These are users we need to support, too.
00:29:58	Ansgar Dietrichs:	right, to me gas limits are less about hard fork timing sprints, and more about continuous efforts.

but it still makes sense to account for that when doing hard fork scoping, so we understand that clients will already be busy with that scaling work
00:30:34	Storm Slivkoff:	Replying to "120GB/year is not a ..."

If you don’t meet the recommended specs, it’s recommended that you upgrade

Yes, I think this is really important
00:30:42	Justin Florentine (Besu):	can we come up with a way to vett that gas-limit to state growth is linear/proportional? it's reasonable, but it's an assumption.
00:30:57	MariusVanDerWijden:	@marek https://github.com/jsvisa/goleveldb-bench/blob/pebble/pebble-2.md RW goes up 10x in a 500GB set compared to a 100GB set

that’s also why I don’t think these discussions e.g. around state growth are counter arguments: we only decide to put resources towards scaling, and then yes, responsible scaling means making sure any increase we recommend is actually sustainable

00:41:08	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Question:
Should we consider having a small repricing EIP in Fusaka?

Poll all the clients in the next 2 weeks what specifically they are most worried about to go to say 100M gas, and then just make those specific things more expensive in Fusaka?

so e.g. make state growth 2x more expensive.

because otherwise next opportunity is Glamsterdam, so scaling might be blocked at that lower safe limit for the next 12 months or longer

not a big fan of the community focused approaches. Give community what it needs and not what it wants.
00:50:37	Mario Vega:	I think that CPU testing and CPU edge cases could be done in EEST because they don't need a huge state, so the idea would be that if you have such cases in your unit test set, it would be great we port them to EEST where all clients can consume them

I think it’s for both though
00:52:23	Francis Li:	Replying to "given that scaling i…"

small caveat: there were still some very small adjustments we might want to make. what would be the timeline until the spec at least for the next devnet would have to be final?

@sanleo
01:23:15	Justin Florentine (Besu):	fair. some things that are CFI'd need specs
01:23:41	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think everything we CFI’d so far is “small enough we are okay with adding to fusaka” with the caveat of “if one of the less important ones causes delays, it’s out”.

so now we are only talking about ordering of when to bring them over into the main devnets
