00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.250
Pooja Ranjan: Hello! Everyone.

2
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.870
Ben Adams: Hey!

3
00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.670
Tim Beiko: Good morning!

4
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.810
Pooja Ranjan: Good morning!

5
00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:56.590
Tim Beiko: Okay, 1 min and we'll get started.

6
00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.599
Tim Beiko: Okay, Josh, you wanna move us over.

7
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.089
Josh Davis: You are, live.

8
00:05:42.920 --> 00:06:02.690
Tim Beiko: Thank you. Welcome everyone to acde number 2, 0, 9. So a couple of things on the agenda today 1st any updates on Petra. And specifically, there's a minor change around the 7, 10 0, 2 receipts that we need to discuss.

9
00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:19.750
Tim Beiko: Then we'll spend big chunk of the call, I imagine talking about Fusaka our deadline to finalize the scope was today, and then potentially expect extending into next week. Cl call as we discussed last week.

10
00:06:20.473 --> 00:06:27.800
Tim Beiko: And then finally, at the end, I had this proposal around reconfiguring all core devs. So we can discuss that.

11
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:35.084
Tim Beiko: And yeah, I guess. Before we go into the 7 7 0, 2 receipts, proposal,

12
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:41.000
Tim Beiko: any devnet or implementation updates on Petra that people wanted to share.

13
00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:55.410
Piper Merriam: There is a Pr. Open for the E. 69 Dev. P. 2. P. Protocol that it would be really good for teams to review quickly so that we can get that finalized.

14
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.440
Tim Beiko: And this is about the drop in history.

15
00:07:00.435 --> 00:07:01.860
Piper Merriam: It's related. Yes.

16
00:07:03.105 --> 00:07:05.089
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Do you want to post the Pr. In the chat, please?

17
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.850
Tim Beiko: I'm ben.

18
00:07:10.554 --> 00:07:15.939
Ben Adams: If 69 doesn't actually need to happen on a hard work, does it?

19
00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.029
Felix: Well, it'd be pretty nice if we had it.

20
00:07:21.710 --> 00:07:26.099
Ben Adams: No, I mean that. Yeah, I mean, it can happen anytime, I assume.

21
00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:34.180
Felix: Well, it's more like if we get it in now, it's pretty sure that, like most people are going to have it after. So it makes it a lot more available.

22
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:35.590
Ben Adams: Yeah.

23
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:43.010
Ben Adams: but I mean it, doesn't it? It's not. It doesn't alter the timeline of the circuit. It's not like a

24
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:44.360
Ben Adams: your risk coming up.

25
00:07:49.710 --> 00:08:06.209
Tim Beiko: And I guess, yeah, on on the timelines point. So the expectation is that by the end of next week, early the week after we have, the client releases and then the announcement for the fork should go out on the 20, second or 23rd

26
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.930
Tim Beiko: Is that still reasonable.

27
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:15.810
Tim Beiko: No major concerns or issues round up.

28
00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:22.549
Tim Beiko: Okay?

29
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:35.799
Tim Beiko: then. Yes. There was this point raised around the transaction receipts for 7 7 0, 2 I'll post the Pr. In the chat here.

30
00:08:37.036 --> 00:08:40.500
Tim Beiko: Oh, thank you. Yeah, Lucas, do you wanna give some context on this.

31
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:47.279
Lucas: Actually, this was written by my colleague Nicholas.

32
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:52.473
Lucas: But it's a pretty small change for context.

33
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.049
Lucas: we just want to add the

34
00:08:56.690 --> 00:09:00.349
Lucas: results of the authorization into the transaction receipt.

35
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:06.890
Lucas: So for context, right now to identify whether the authorization has passed.

36
00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.640
Lucas: we have to do if get code

37
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:16.320
Lucas: to check. So we thought it'd be a better developer experience if we can add this

38
00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:20.100
Lucas: success or failure in the authorization.

39
00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:23.659
Lucas: Oh, success or failure of this authorization in the transaction receipt.

40
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:33.160
Felix: Sorry to just speak up, but I think it's not possible this way, because then we would have to actually store this

41
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.470
Felix: right.

42
00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:40.190
Tim Beiko: What do you mean by store this.

43
00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:55.690
Felix: I mean, the thing is that the success or failure of the authorization, I guess, depends on a couple things. So this field would have to be stored by the clients into their respective databases in order to be available within the receipt.

44
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:57.220
Felix: And

45
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:05.060
Felix: I'm not sure if it's possible right now to make such a change like we're pretty late. And at this point we're just waiting for, you know, like

46
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:15.129
Felix: the date to arrive of the fork, so we can no longer make these types of changes where we just, you know, like, adapt some fundamental like this is not a change. That is just an

47
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:20.099
Felix: Rpc. Api change. I feel like this requires some actual

48
00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.280
Felix: changes in the client to make it work.

49
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.610
Felix: Maybe I'm wrong, but seems to me like might be too late for this one.

50
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.933
Tim Beiko: Right and and, like client, says in the chat, it depends on the current nonce.

51
00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:47.620
Felix: Yeah. So that's the thing like the validity of the authorization depends on the nonce. It depends on the signature validity, and I guess

52
00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:52.639
Felix: it's kind of it. I guess there is another check in there somehow, like it cannot be.

53
00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:13.579
Felix: I guess you can override a delegation, but I vaguely remember there was one other one. So the main thing is that these are conditions. I mean the signature. Validity is never going to change, so we can determine that statically from the transaction, we could at the time of serving the receipt on the Rpc. We could actually basically parse the signature again and validate it. And if it's

54
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:17.270
Felix: wrong, then well, we're not going to have

55
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:33.110
Felix: is not going to be, you know, passed but the but the other thing with the nonce, then we would have to check, you know, in what was the state at the time of the transaction inclusion, and this would require, like an archive node, to actually know.

56
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:48.549
Felix: So we, the only other thing in order to really correctly serve this for all time, is we would have to store the success into the receipt itself into the client database. And, like, I said, we can no longer make this type of change now so late in the pipeline.

57
00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:57.349
Tim Beiko: So. And so I guess, yeah. And so in practice. Now, what the what you have to do is to call, get code and then

58
00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:01.009
Tim Beiko: parse the response. I guess. Yeah, I'd be curious

59
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:05.359
Tim Beiko: when in the doc. It says, you know, you need to parse the response. But is it just

60
00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:14.149
Tim Beiko: checking that. There's now code in this doa, or you're matching that against some like expected delegation template. There.

61
00:12:18.726 --> 00:12:26.440
Lucas: Okay, I guess because we're not call deaf. So we did not fully recognize the

62
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.410
Lucas: the implementation details. So

63
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:38.801
Lucas: yeah, we thought it would be a minor change to improve like the developer experience. But if the risk is too high, I guess.

64
00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:43.609
Lucas: this can be this can. This should not be considered.

65
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:50.465
Tim Beiko: Yeah, and I, yeah, and I guess I'm trying to understand how bad is it on the developer experience perspective?

66
00:12:52.840 --> 00:13:02.809
Tim Beiko: yeah, like is from my, it's like you're doing one extra Rpc call and then matching the data

67
00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:03.990
Tim Beiko: against this.

68
00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:25.853
nic: Sorry. Let me jump in here. So I am the original author of this proposal. So I think the the feedback that we got from the team is that it kind of breaks away from the current. Validation cycle of wallet provider, where, instead of just

69
00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:33.630
nic: getting the result through a transaction receipt. There are additional steps just to accommodate this spectral workflow.

70
00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:48.919
nic: Yeah, this is why this is the original reason why we propose this change to the Api. And like, look, I said, we initially thought, I mean, we're not called this. So we initially thought this would be a small change just to improve the quality of life.

71
00:13:49.200 --> 00:14:01.009
nic: But if this is as big of a change as Felix has mentioned, maybe we can reconsider the workflow on our end, and maybe just work around going through to our PC. Calls.

72
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.459
Tim Beiko: And I guess one comment in the chat as well is that we probably don't need a hard fork to

73
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:23.879
Tim Beiko: add this if we wanted to in the future. So I would lean towards not adding this for now, because, yeah, we are pretty close to to shipping the fork but then, if it is like a major pain point, this is something we can add to clients,

74
00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:33.477
Tim Beiko: after the fork, and I assume this is also something. This would not be ideal, but this is also something that, like some clients, could support, and not all.

75
00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.440
Tim Beiko: yeah, Felix.

76
00:14:35.760 --> 00:15:05.750
Felix: So I have 2 opinions. 1st of all, this shouldn't be something that some clients support and others don't. We've been fighting a lot against these types of, you know, like customized Rpc extensions. And I think from our point of view, it's not really something we should be doing anymore, because it's causing us a lot of trouble actually, with these incompatibilities. And then the second thing is that it would require a hard fork if it is supposed to be stored within the receipt officially, because changing receipts is always a hard fork. It changes the receipt hash as well, so it has to be coordinated.

77
00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:16.480
Felix: That's kind of the thing I mean. The clients could in theory store it somehow in the so the way it works in most clients is that they only store

78
00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:45.020
Felix: for receipts like the minimum amount of information you have to store for receipts is exactly the information which is generated by the consensus protocol. So it's just a couple of fields, and then the rest of them. You can kind of derive some clients store additional information in a database about the receipt, some stuff, so they don't have to derive it later. And this is something which is possible, but it comes at the expense of making the database larger. So it's something to know, and then you can also no longer validate the receipts that you are storing against the consensus directly, because the consensus only

79
00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:54.489
Felix: secure certain fields. So this is just something to know if we want to add it to this critical set of of fields which is secured by the consensus. It's going to be a hard fork to add it.

80
00:15:58.430 --> 00:15:59.337
Tim Beiko: Okay. Roman.

81
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:05.759
Roman: Can we maybe consider adding it only for the like? A few recent blogs.

82
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:10.659
Roman: and then it would be trivial on both archival and full nodes to drive the skill.

83
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.340
Tim Beiko: So the receipt. How would that work in practice.

84
00:16:19.087 --> 00:16:25.229
Roman: I mean, we would not store it in the receipt, but we would just have this field on the Rpc.

85
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:30.691
Tim Beiko: So you and and you.

86
00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:38.139
Tim Beiko: yes, kind of like the block hash, I think you can only query, for, like, what is it? 256 bucks, or something like that, so like

87
00:16:38.370 --> 00:16:40.039
Tim Beiko: a similar design to that.

88
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:50.020
Roman: Yeah, but because, as far as I understand, like you, you only care about like authorization succeeding

89
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.769
Roman: in the moment when you're submitting it.

90
00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:15.770
Felix: So if you, if this is what you care about, then you can. If this is the workflow to basically just ask directly after submitting the transaction. If it has worked, you can always work around it with Json, Rpc. Advisor, sending a batch with 2 items. One would be the get received and the other one is, get code. And then if if they you know.

91
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.170
Felix: it is probably going to be okay.

92
00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:28.159
Tim Beiko: Okay? So I guess yeah, we should not

93
00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.112
Tim Beiko: change to specs now. It seems like there's workarounds.

94
00:17:33.759 --> 00:17:47.529
Tim Beiko: what's the best place? Is there like an Eth. Yeah, there's an Eth. Magicians. I guess it's a 7 7 0, 2 eth magicians thread. But yeah, maybe we can just move the conversation there to figure out. If there is a simple

95
00:17:47.789 --> 00:17:59.230
Tim Beiko: Jason Rpc, change, we can make that doesn't require a hard fork that would make this flow easier. And if there isn't, then also just defining what's like, the best?

96
00:17:59.969 --> 00:18:03.199
Tim Beiko: yeah. The best way to to efficiently query this data.

97
00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.439
Lucas: Alright. Thank you very much.

98
00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:12.659
Tim Beiko: Yeah, thank you.

99
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:22.899
Tim Beiko: Okay, anything else on Petra that people wanted to discuss.

100
00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:54.019
Tim Beiko: Sweet. So yeah, I guess this means we're wrapping up Petra. Again. Yeah, please have your releases out by the end of the next week or early the week after that, and we will get this deployed for anyone listening. The Hard fork is scheduled to happen on May 7.th so plan to update your notes before then.

101
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.280
Tim Beiko: Okay. So next up Fusaka.

102
00:19:01.896 --> 00:19:17.830
Tim Beiko: So we'd agreed that we would finalize the scope for the fork as we wrapped up Petra, and we'd set a deadline of today, I think. On the Cl call last week realized they might need an extra week to do so. And then hopefully, we can get

103
00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:22.489
Tim Beiko: the El side of things finalized. On this call.

104
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:29.150
Tim Beiko: And 1st before we get into like the specific team preferences. I realize we

105
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:43.324
Tim Beiko: didn't quite define. We didn't define super explicitly what finalized would mean. Reflecting on it after last week's call. I think the good a good bar for this should be that

106
00:19:44.090 --> 00:20:09.039
Tim Beiko: we decide what's the final set of considered for inclusions eips ideally today. And then everything else that was proposed kind of by definition gets declined for this fork, and then for anything that's Cfid we would only move things to to be scheduled for inclusions. Once we're ready to implement them in devnets.

107
00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:39.341
Tim Beiko: so effectively like the the deadline today would be for proposals for the fork. Then we're working from a smaller set of things. Based on what we can actually implement. And I think the one thing that literally every single team agreed on with regards to their prioritization is that we should ship Fusaka in 2025 that peered us should be in it. So any inclusions we make beyond that should not affect this.

108
00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:45.299
Tim Beiko: yeah, I guess. 1st of all, does this seem reasonable to people? To anyone have like an objection with

109
00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:50.799
Tim Beiko: the process like this at a high level, or is it unclear in any way?

110
00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.150
Tim Beiko: Okay? Let's go then.

111
00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:04.716
Tim Beiko: so given this. Yeah. All of the El teams shared their preferences.

112
00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:14.899
Tim Beiko: on the last call the last El call we'd already we'd already Cfid. Or sorry we'd already

113
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.849
Tim Beiko: specified one other.

114
00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:26.810
Tim Beiko: Okay, sorry, my bad on the last call we Cfid one other eip for the MoD Xp gas through pricing.

115
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:51.620
Tim Beiko: Let me just post the list in the chat so as it stands today, the only things that are scheduled are pure das, and then the devnet, 0 and devnet one. Versions of eof the things that are Cfid are the r. 1 precompile, rip. 71, 2, the devnet, 2 eof vips, and then this MoD. Xp gas cost increase

116
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:59.838
Tim Beiko: in terms of like the the things client teams kind of signaled that they would like.

117
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:13.860
Tim Beiko: we I don't think there was anything else that was effectively supported by teams unit unanimously. The

118
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.456
Tim Beiko: let me look through the list with like the other broadly supported ones were

119
00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.929
Tim Beiko: so I guess the yeah. The other ones around

120
00:22:25.041 --> 00:22:29.489
Tim Beiko: addressing MoD. MoD. Xp. Where

121
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:40.589
Tim Beiko: also popular. So let me get the exact number the upper bound limit on MoD. Xp, so 7, 8, 2, 3 was kind of the other one that stood out.

122
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.734
Tim Beiko: yeah, as as like broadly supported.

123
00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:48.540
Tim Beiko: And then, yeah, maybe

124
00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:56.599
Tim Beiko: I guess as the next step. If some of the client teams want to share, like in more detail what they'd like to see

125
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:04.500
Tim Beiko: what they'd like to see included, or like Cfid beyond this. That's probably a good, a good step.

126
00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:06.469
Tim Beiko: Yeah, Ben.

127
00:23:07.235 --> 00:23:14.759
Ben Adams: Since it was brought up at the the start of the call and support. If 69

128
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:16.030
Ben Adams: But I'm

129
00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:24.000
Ben Adams: from 2 points of view. It's, you know, helpful, but also from the point of view it it's not

130
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:30.459
Ben Adams: contingent on the Fork timeline, so it'd be nice to get into the fork, but it'd be good to market as a

131
00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:31.220
Ben Adams: a finger.

132
00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:34.940
Tim Beiko: So 8, 69, didn't we just say we wanted that for Petra.

133
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:40.520
Ben Adams: Deirdre.

134
00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:48.020
Tim Beiko: I mean earlier on like, was it? Weren't we talking about this like 5 min ago, saying it would be nice to have.

135
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.220
Ben Adams: I thought we were saying, but yeah, okay.

136
00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.689
Tim Beiko: So, okay, so, sorry. So, so for each 69.

137
00:23:56.620 --> 00:23:57.250
Tim Beiko: So.

138
00:23:57.610 --> 00:24:00.309
Ben Adams: Pre merge fields. It's the 1st one in the list.

139
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:07.759
Tim Beiko: Yes. So okay. So earlier, when we were saying, we want to have this done.

140
00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:19.229
Tim Beiko: my understanding is we wanted to have it done for the Petra releases, so that the everyone who updates at Petra has this activated is that not correct?

141
00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:27.480
Ben Adams: Yeah, that'd be nice.

142
00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:32.610
Tim Beiko: Okay. But like, yeah, I I guess.

143
00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:38.449
Tim Beiko: do client teams generally want to try and get this like when we say Petro means in the next week

144
00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:44.940
Tim Beiko: is this, that was my understanding of the earlier conversation. Is that correct? Yeah, Andrew.

145
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:59.349
Andrew Ashikhmin: Well, so about dropping pretty much block bodies. Then. So where we are going to experiment with it on Sepoli. But we are not making.

146
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:08.350
Andrew Ashikhmin: Probably we won't be making a a release in the pector timeframe. We'll have a release, maybe a month or 2 later.

147
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:19.880
Andrew Ashikhmin: but also about it 69. It's it's nice if if 69 specifies the available block range

148
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:34.479
Andrew Ashikhmin: and we'll implement it at some point, probably. But again, for dropping free pretty much block bodies. It's it's not strictly necessary, we will just probably reply, with new block bodies on E. 68.

149
00:25:37.230 --> 00:25:37.890
Tim Beiko: Okay.

150
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:50.830
Tim Beiko: okay, so we won't have all the teams with 8, 69 before Petra. But

151
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:58.013
Tim Beiko: teams are actually spending. Yeah, spending time on this.

152
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:03.839
Tim Beiko: and yeah, it because it doesn't require a hard fork. It's kind of

153
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:08.770
Tim Beiko: awkward or to include it. But I

154
00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:28.209
Tim Beiko: yeah, okay, I I think we can probably table that one for now. And just accept that teams will be working on supporting this and figure out the right place to to put it, but I agree it should go live before yeah, before Fussaka Felix.

155
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:41.549
Felix: I just want to make a quick comment, Tim. So here's the thing, right. We've had it in the past that we've included an eip. I don't forget which one it was that was literally just signaling the intent for us to do something.

156
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.230
Tim Beiko: Yeah, this.

157
00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:44.849
Felix: I feel like this.

158
00:26:45.050 --> 00:26:49.140
Felix: If we can do that one, then we might as well go with the E. 69.

159
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:53.029
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I think that's fair. Like, I, I think, yeah.

160
00:26:53.630 --> 00:27:00.158
Tim Beiko: we can figure out the right way to frame it. But I think saying, like, yeah, we want 8, 69, if not before Petra. Shortly after

161
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:14.319
Tim Beiko: I'll find a way to put that in the in the specs. But I don't wanna spend too much time on like the logistics of that now, does that, I guess. Does any client team disagree that they'll be supporting E. 69 in the next few months.

162
00:27:20.050 --> 00:27:33.220
Tim Beiko: Okay, so we'll move forward with 8, 69, and yeah, I think to the extent some teams have it before Petra. That would be good, because it means all the people updating for Petra will not be able to use that.

163
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.370
Tim Beiko: there is like, yeah. One

164
00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:45.340
Tim Beiko: one interesting question in the chat around raising the gas limit, which is another thing that's been discussed.

165
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.570
Tim Beiko: it's kind of a weird topic, because there's no

166
00:27:48.770 --> 00:28:06.165
Tim Beiko: vip for this right? It's not something that the clients control. But it is something that takes work like marius comments that you know, get has some memory issues now at 60 million. And so fixing those things is something that takes like client teams bandwidth.

167
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:12.730
Tim Beiko: so is that something that we should somehow also incorporate in this and like,

168
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:19.199
Tim Beiko: yeah, I I don't know if we should have just like some placeholder Eip that says.

169
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:31.149
Tim Beiko: try to get the gas limit to a hundred 1 million dollars or 100 million gas, and then fix all the bugs that come up as part of that. The clients have thoughts on how we should best approach this.

170
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.090
Tim Beiko: Hi, yeah, Andrew.

171
00:28:43.090 --> 00:28:55.740
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, I think Julia has written an IP on how to do it in a kind of manageable fashion. I just okay. I don't let me try to find this.

172
00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:18.650
Tim Beiko: So, yeah. So Julio's vip was like, how does the gas limit actually upgrade on on chain, which I think is different from saying, independent of the mechanism. We just want to reach this number and fix all the bugs like Julio's. Vip didn't make a recommendation about like what it should be. It was more like we can go from X to Y and like, here's like a mechanism to do that gradually.

173
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:26.449
Tim Beiko: this feel different than saying, we want to reach a hundred 1 million gas. And that's like our priority.

174
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:38.537
Tim Beiko: And there's, like, you know, the mechanism by which it it it gets activated doesn't need to change necessarily. But saying like, Okay, get feels

175
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:48.503
Tim Beiko: you know, like, get feels like it. You get to spending time on this Om issue, and then never mind us some other issues, and they're spending time on it.

176
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:50.040
Tim Beiko: yeah.

177
00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:52.899
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yes, so

178
00:29:53.990 --> 00:30:00.793
Andrew Ashikhmin: I I like to be honest. I think that we should do it post Fussaka, but but

179
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:08.019
Andrew Ashikhmin: probably it's too early to discuss Post Fusaka, but I would do it in the 1st fork after Fussaka.

180
00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:13.380
Tim Beiko: So you're saying you would not want to raise the gas limit before Fussaka.

181
00:30:14.491 --> 00:30:16.600
Andrew Ashikhmin: That. That's my personal view. Yes.

182
00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.790
Tim Beiko: Okay, yeah.

183
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:25.800
Tim Beiko: I guess. Yeah. Danka, do you wanna give your perspective on this.

184
00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.520
Dankrad Feist: Right? I mean, I think, yeah, we we should really try to. I mean, I think

185
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:41.699
Dankrad Feist: we should just see this as independent of the Hard Fork schedule, but still, like I think it's just relatively urgent, and it's

186
00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:43.330
Dankrad Feist: not.

187
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:52.219
Dankrad Feist: not good. If this always falls behind and like what we are working on is only the things that are in the A piece. And then

188
00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.659
Dankrad Feist: we ignore this part. So I think, like.

189
00:30:56.590 --> 00:31:05.710
Dankrad Feist: yeah, on a relatively short timeline, getting all the hurdles out of the way that technically limit us to below 100 million

190
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.829
Dankrad Feist: seems very high value.

191
00:31:10.363 --> 00:31:16.590
Dankrad Feist: Also, in terms of our signaling to the community that we are actually taking this seriously. And this is not just like

192
00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.629
Dankrad Feist: everything slides back after there was a big

193
00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:27.949
Dankrad Feist: I don't know public discussion about this. And people felt like we're finally moving and scaling their one as well.

194
00:31:32.050 --> 00:31:39.729
Tim Beiko: Yeah. And yeah, comment in the chat saying, like, you know, we, we probably don't need to make a final decision about this today.

195
00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:50.613
Tim Beiko: I would agree. But I also want to avoid the case where we don't think about this, and we just add a bunch of vips. And then we say, you know, we don't have any bandwidth to think about the gas limit.

196
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.580
Tim Beiko: yeah.

197
00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.610
Tim Beiko: Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

198
00:31:54.970 --> 00:32:17.959
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. Then maybe just as a quick Meta comment, like, I do think in general, that going forward on the El side, we should given that we just in the past specifically made the choice not to scale the El right, like the L is basically other than this 1. 20% bump of this year is still at the same state that it was at the merge and at the merge. We basically stayed at the same level that we were pre-merged without, except for this small kind of block, like

199
00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:32.419
Ansgar Dietrichs: block time shortening, I think. Kind of now we're starting to line on this decision of changing that. And so if we change that, that just means that we need to be aware that from this point onwards a significant portion of overall el bandwidth

200
00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:42.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: development bandwidth will be consumed by performance increases. And so that just means that the overall shipping bandwidth of new features is going down.

201
00:32:42.643 --> 00:32:55.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: So yeah, so I think, basically for any new hard folk, we should just basically have on the El side, lighter, lighter than we basically think we can do. Because, yeah, the the other focus should always be implied. Increase in performance.

202
00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.380
Tim Beiko: Ben.

203
00:33:01.783 --> 00:33:13.880
Ben Adams: In light of that direction I'd like to pose for inclusion the transaction gas cap limit so that we don't. If the gas limit does block increases to say.

204
00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:20.200
Ben Adams: 60 million. We don't want a single transaction that uses the entire block.

205
00:33:21.808 --> 00:33:27.309
Ben Adams: It's bad for paralyzation. Further optimization. And we? We also don't know.

206
00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:37.730
Ben Adams: There, there are unknowns in, you know. There might be an end. Something that's n squared, that suddenly becomes, you know, a problem when transactions get that big.

207
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.920
Tim Beiko: One question I would have it'd be good to hear what other clients seem to think. But

208
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:53.369
Tim Beiko: like. Why should it be 30, and not 10, or 15, or.

209
00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:54.450
Tim Beiko: You know.

210
00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:59.110
Ben Adams: Low, low lower would be better. But I think the idea was

211
00:33:59.310 --> 00:34:03.491
Ben Adams: we haven't done any analysis, and you can currently do that. So.

212
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.489
Tim Beiko: So yeah, 30 is is our worst case today. And we live with this. Yes.

213
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.821
Ben Adams: Last 36, but.

214
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.699
Tim Beiko: Oh, yeah. Yeah.

215
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:14.989
Ben Adams: Hour would be, would be better.

216
00:34:16.625 --> 00:34:17.120
Tim Beiko: Andrew.

217
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:21.730
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, also, 30 million is the limit for Cisco transactions.

218
00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:24.409
Tim Beiko: Okay?

219
00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.389
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Like client. You have a comment about the count. Abstraction.

220
00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:49.990
lightclient: Yeah, I mean, I think we should see how 7,702 plays out on Mainnet before we make any kind of decision on limiting the amount of gas per transaction, because there's a very real possibility that the number of transactions per block goes down significantly after Petra and

221
00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:55.109
lightclient: most people are being bundled in a single transaction that is, more than 30 million guests.

222
00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:05.010
Dankrad Feist: But what's the downsides to bundling this into 4 transactions of 7.5 million each?

223
00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.300
lightclient: Well, you pay more gas for storage reads.

224
00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.429
lightclient: since you can take advantage of the warming.

225
00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:27.190
Dankrad Feist: For example, if we want to parallelize, then we need to cap the size of the transaction, because you can never parallelize 1 30 million transaction, but you can parallelize several smaller ones.

226
00:35:27.630 --> 00:35:29.170
Dankrad Feist: So I think, like.

227
00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:34.900
Dankrad Feist: it is just essential to do this, and we'll have to like people will have to pack them into smaller

228
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:36.490
Dankrad Feist: transactions.

229
00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:43.220
Ben Adams: Also it means if if it's a 30 million, if it's a entire block transaction

230
00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:50.570
Ben Adams: that would imply that it's a single bundler that is dominating, you know, pushing out everybody, everybody else.

231
00:35:50.830 --> 00:36:01.120
lightclient: That's not true. That's the entire design of 4,237 is to have a way to get to the transactions of the person who's building the block so they can bundle all of them.

232
00:36:04.090 --> 00:36:07.319
Tim Beiko: And I guess, would you? Do you think

233
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:10.779
Tim Beiko: that's a concern, even with a 30 million?

234
00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:25.580
Tim Beiko: Guess it like if we or and we can make it 36, whatever. But, like, you know, if we ship 7, 7 0 2 tomorrow, there is already an implicit cap of 36 million for a single transaction. So

235
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:29.410
Tim Beiko: should. We

236
00:36:29.710 --> 00:36:39.139
Tim Beiko: also have, like the cap and protocol on the transaction size, so that if we increase the gas limit, we're kind of not implicitly increasing the transaction size limit at the same time.

237
00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:52.239
lightclient: I mean, I think we should just see what we can do with transaction parallelization. First, st before we start putting strict requirements. The protocol for the size of gas limits, like, it seems like we're preemptively talking about this.

238
00:36:55.170 --> 00:37:01.088
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I guess. Yeah, to answer point in chat, we're trying to decide if we want to. Cfi this so like,

239
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:07.929
Tim Beiko: I don't know how the it seems like they sue.

240
00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:13.339
Marius: I'm strongly in favor of sifying this and of doing this because I think it's just

241
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:21.909
Marius: It also becomes a thing of fairness at some point. If if these

242
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:33.160
Marius: if these Bundler transactions can price out anyone because they can build the full block of of transactions, I also don't think it's it's super fair.

243
00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.010
Marius: So I would rather have them

244
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:40.560
Marius: send 2 or 3 transactions. And then the likelihood that someone can

245
00:37:40.770 --> 00:37:45.449
Marius: can get there in their transactions. And it's it's increasing.

246
00:37:49.550 --> 00:37:50.230
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Lucas.

247
00:37:50.230 --> 00:38:04.240
Łukasz Rozmej: One last thing, this cap is relatively easily to increase or lift in the future right? So, cap to something that we have now, and just to be safe, and then we can iterate on it.

248
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.320
Tim Beiko: Okay, then, yeah, I think we should at least cfi it. And we can. We can.

249
00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:17.959
Tim Beiko: Yeah, decide if and how we want to implement it at a later date, but it seems like there's some

250
00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:24.606
Tim Beiko: support for it. And then, if to the extent we actually want to raise the gas limit. It can be helpful.

251
00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:27.390
Tim Beiko: yeah. So I would. Cfi, this one.

252
00:38:27.860 --> 00:38:35.230
Tim Beiko: And Carl, yeah, you have a comment. About 7, 2, 1, 2.

253
00:38:37.110 --> 00:38:41.240
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah. So curl of butts recently found that

254
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:48.549
Carl Beekhuizen: back for 7, 2, 1, 2. That's the r, 1 free compile. Add a bug edit.

255
00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:52.030
Carl Beekhuizen: and so we will need a new

256
00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:59.189
Carl Beekhuizen: rip. Slash eip if you want to ship this which is basically the same thing to put the same address. But with this.

257
00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:03.089
Carl Beekhuizen: patriots very minor, but should be done.

258
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.020
Tim Beiko: So? Why.

259
00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:08.100
Carl Beekhuizen: Ended up being in being yeah, in terms of.

260
00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:16.180
Tim Beiko: Why can't we just update? Yeah, why can't we just update the spec? Because the spec specifies the address. And we need to change the address to fix this bug, or.

261
00:39:16.705 --> 00:39:22.019
Carl Beekhuizen: No use the same address. But the problem is that the this has already been hit on

262
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:25.130
Carl Beekhuizen: one of the L twos, and so.

263
00:39:25.130 --> 00:39:25.510
Tim Beiko: Oh!

264
00:39:25.510 --> 00:39:26.309
Carl Beekhuizen: Me too.

265
00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.360
Tim Beiko: Okay.

266
00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:33.119
Carl Beekhuizen: Like in terms of activating things. Whatever we need, we we need a new number to redeploy the same address

267
00:39:33.250 --> 00:39:34.290
Carl Beekhuizen: for their sake.

268
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.120
Carl Beekhuizen: Those yeah.

269
00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.210
Tim Beiko: That seems.

270
00:39:37.850 --> 00:39:42.570
Tim Beiko: Yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, we should treat this as though it was

271
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.669
Tim Beiko: like just fixing a bug in the specs. I don't think we should.

272
00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.609
Carl Beekhuizen: Yeah, it. It doesn't change. It doesn't change anything from.

273
00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:49.090
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

274
00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:54.689
Carl Beekhuizen: The the l. 1 slash eip standpoint. It just means that there'll be a new number for it. But just to expect that, and.

275
00:39:54.910 --> 00:40:00.590
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Yeah. And I think, yeah, if you can just open a Pr, once we have the new number to, and like

276
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:06.510
Tim Beiko: on on the Meta vip, and just explain this. That seems reasonable to just swap.

277
00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.699
Carl Beekhuizen: Absolutely. I'll do that.

278
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:09.780
Tim Beiko: Yep.

279
00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:20.092
Tim Beiko: okay, I guess. Aside from the transaction limit cap, are there other vips? Some clients felt strongly about

280
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:26.950
Tim Beiko: stiffying today? That yeah, we should add to this list.

281
00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:33.379
Tim Beiko: And I posted the full list of what's been proposed in the chat.

282
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.500
Tim Beiko: okay? And if okay,

283
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:58.000
Tim Beiko: yeah. And as I see, you have a comment. But I yeah, the Zoom client teams first, st and then I know that there's also 2 Vip champions here, so we can. We can

284
00:40:58.790 --> 00:41:02.089
Tim Beiko: do Onsgar, and then the 2 IP champions after. But

285
00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:06.429
Tim Beiko: yeah, like clients increasing the code size which one is this

286
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.209
Tim Beiko: or the contracts up.

287
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.190
Marius: 7, 9 0 3 sorry! 7, 9, 0 7.

288
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:19.979
Tim Beiko: 7, 9, 0, 7.

289
00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:27.550
Marius: We? We are kind of against 7, 9, 0, 3, because it removes the entire limit, and we are for 7, 9 0, 7,

290
00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:33.600
Marius: which increases the the code size limit.

291
00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:43.040
Marius: but also adds, adds additional cost, and it's not unbounded.

292
00:41:47.470 --> 00:41:48.530
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Charles.

293
00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.669
Charles C: Yeah, I'm the author of both of these vips. I think that.

294
00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:03.310
Charles C: Well, I was given the feedback that it could have a limit. A little bit later.

295
00:42:03.845 --> 00:42:06.990
Charles C: I think it would be okay to add it as like

296
00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:11.990
Charles C: one x or 2 x the limit in the runtime code size limit.

297
00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:16.209
Charles C: I don't really see a need for it, because

298
00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:20.709
Charles C: the Init code limit is already basically, the Init code

299
00:42:20.850 --> 00:42:23.050
Charles C: doesn't incur a read from State.

300
00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.629
Charles C: and it's already paid for by memory expansion. But

301
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:30.529
Charles C: if people are more comfortable with the limit, I'm happy to add that in.

302
00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:42.319
Marius: The problem is that you can just create really, really big contracts, a really, really big init code and then execute certain attacks

303
00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:43.640
Marius: because of that.

304
00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.889
Marius: So that's why. Why the.

305
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:47.800
Charles C: That's.

306
00:42:48.110 --> 00:42:49.790
Marius: Jump Destin notices.

307
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:52.590
Charles C: It's already metered.

308
00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.420
Charles C: So it's like paid basically per word.

309
00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.180
Marius: It would still.

310
00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:15.440
Charles C: I ran benchmarks, and the cost to do jump desk analysis is like very much linear in the size of the code. So I think that a linear cost makes sense.

311
00:43:22.127 --> 00:43:41.439
Guillaume: Did you publish those benchmarks? Because I remember so that was back in the day there was a great Colvin. We haven't seen him in a while. He he was actually having an opinion about this, the ability, the possibility to Ddos this stuff. Maybe I'm misremembering, but it would be very important to

312
00:43:41.650 --> 00:43:43.380
Guillaume: to figure out if that is true.

313
00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:50.269
Charles C: Yes, the benchmarks are published, and there's a link to them in the youth magicians discussions today.

314
00:43:51.330 --> 00:43:52.330
Tim Beiko: And I guess

315
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:58.699
Tim Beiko: yeah. So, Charles, if assuming the client teams prefer 7, 9 0, 7, and you're an author on this one where you?

316
00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.360
Tim Beiko: Were you happy with

317
00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:07.159
Tim Beiko: 7, 9. So 7 like you have, like a preference for 7, 9, 0 3. But are you also happy with 7, 9, 0 7.

318
00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:15.140
Charles C: I think they both need to go in, because without an innate code size increase, you can't practically

319
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:19.289
Charles C: deploy larger contracts.

320
00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:21.150
Tim Beiko: I see

321
00:44:25.230 --> 00:44:30.490
Tim Beiko: any other client. Teams have opinions on this one or.

322
00:44:34.706 --> 00:44:41.099
Guillaume: I'm not another client team, but I do have an opinion. When we redid we did the redesign

323
00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:59.320
Guillaume: of the tree. Whatever is going to be for call binary. Blah! Blah! We are trying to store everything in a in a single leaf in a single 32 Byte word, and we only have so far 2 Byte reserved for the

324
00:44:59.460 --> 00:45:01.960
Guillaume: for the code size.

325
00:45:02.885 --> 00:45:06.940
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Then we up to 3 in a design session. A few months ago I brought this issue up.

326
00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.470
Guillaume: Going in.

327
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:15.260
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: A few months ago I came on call. And didn't you expand it to 3 so we could get 24 Megs instead of just 64 K.

328
00:45:15.572 --> 00:45:30.897
Guillaume: Yeah, so that's what I was gonna say, we, we could expand it to 3 Byte, we have some reserve space. I just want, I mean, but there's still a limit, right? Even if it's even if you make it 2424 MB, it's still

329
00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:40.880
Guillaume: It's still going to be limited. So I would prefer not doing this, not having an unlimited code size, simply because

330
00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:54.449
Guillaume: because I mean, I don't. I don't care if it's 20 MB, or what, I just need something that's gonna fit in a reasonable amount of bytes, so that yeah, so that I don't have to redesign the entire gas cost

331
00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:58.069
Guillaume: for for Eap 4,760.

332
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:00.830
Charles C: I see what app.

333
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.999
Charles C: All right. Go ahead.

334
00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:23.180
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: So if this is combined with the transaction size increase, and there will be a fixed upper limit to how big a contract could be because we have to pay 200 gas per byte, and that comes out right now to about a hundred 40 some odd Kilobytes. So there will be a functional limit, if not an explicit spectrum limit. So as long as we keep a transaction size limit

335
00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:34.899
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: and we make the init code a function of that transaction size limit, we'll still have limits. It's going to be the gas size, the size of the transaction, driving those limits rather than an artificial. Let's give contracts a small limit.

336
00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:39.185
Charles C: Yeah, init code. Never. Actually.

337
00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:47.230
Charles C: I mean, it's correlated with the runtime code. Because typically the way net code works is you just like copy a bunch of bytes to memory and then return it.

338
00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:50.300
Charles C: But it's not actually physically stored in the State.

339
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:58.169
Charles C: So like Dana was saying, like the

340
00:46:59.370 --> 00:47:02.959
Charles C: limit on the Runtime code is like what you really need.

341
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:20.579
Marius: So I think no one is against raising the code size limit as far as I can hear. But.

342
00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.380
Tim Beiko: Still, one abound. Yeah, yeah.

343
00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.400
Marius: We're we're not clear on on the bonds yet. Yes.

344
00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:28.710
Tim Beiko: Which so 7, 9 0. 7 in.

345
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.599
Tim Beiko: Proposes an increase to the bound right.

346
00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.189
Charles C: 7, 9 0, 7 is an increase to the runtime code size limit, and it hasn't found.

347
00:47:38.690 --> 00:47:40.340
Tim Beiko: But not even no sorry.

348
00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:45.110
Charles C: Right and 7, 9 0, 3 uncaps in that code.

349
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:48.770
Tim Beiko: But I guess, yeah, the question is, would people

350
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:55.299
Tim Beiko: prefer? Would people be okay with a larger but capped edit code size?

351
00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.639
lightclient: That's probably my preference.

352
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:07.980
Tim Beiko: Do any other client teams have opinions on this?

353
00:48:19.610 --> 00:48:22.800
Tim Beiko: Okay. So then, I guess, would that mean

354
00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.309
Tim Beiko: Cfi 7, 9, 0, 7. And then.

355
00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:38.339
Tim Beiko: either modifying 7, 9 0, 3. To have a proposed limit, or just adding a init code limit to the 7 9 0, 7

356
00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:41.910
Tim Beiko: Vip. I don't know if people have a preference for for that.

357
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:54.040
Marius: I would do it exactly this way. Do 7, 9, 0 7 into Cfi, and then we change 7, 9, 0 7 to have the same

358
00:48:54.430 --> 00:49:03.269
Marius: in a code limit as we have right now, which is twice the size of the of the Max Contract limit.

359
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:07.330
Marius: which I think is reasonable.

360
00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:14.050
Tim Beiko: Does anyone have concerns or objections about this.

361
00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:20.819
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Not necessarily concern or objection, but I wanna make sure people know that there's going to be an extra charge

362
00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:27.270
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: per word over 24 K. Sounds reasonable to me, but I just wanna make sure people are aware of that.

363
00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:36.970
Tim Beiko: Okay. Hi, Ben.

364
00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.059
Ben Adams: Weren't we concerned about this? About 2 years ago?

365
00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:45.829
Ben Adams: I think I think it came up to increase contract size.

366
00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:59.000
Marius: Yeah, that's that's when back in the day it was unlimited. And that's why we added the for 24 K limit. And now we are increasing the 24 K limit

367
00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:01.480
Marius: to something bigger.

368
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:02.980
Ben Adams: Okay.

369
00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:17.070
lightclient: So historically, we've just had the expectation we would charge the contract size as this constant loading from disk cost, even though the size can differ. And so the limit had to be something that

370
00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:36.789
lightclient: was commensurate with the amount that we were paying. But the cip changes it to be a dynamic cost. The problem with that has historically been that we don't have the size of the code quickly accessible in the State anywhere, so you would still have to load the code and determine the size

371
00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:54.949
lightclient: which defeats the purpose. Of course you could have an additional index in your state database to look up the code, which is what's proposed by the cap. In the past. We've been against doing this because if you want to create some State witness mechanism, then you would still have to provide the entire code because you can't authenticate it off.

372
00:50:55.090 --> 00:51:10.390
lightclient: you know, off consensus index. But because we know now that we're going to need to chunk the code and do things in a smarter way with contract size. I generally think it's okay to have this index and rely on it for the consensus operation.

373
00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.610
Tim Beiko: Okay.

374
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:26.150
Tim Beiko: yeah, thanks everyone. It's okay. We'll see a 5, 7, 9 0, 7, and then add, this extra. Yeah, in the code limit.

375
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:32.540
Tim Beiko: Any other eips client teams feel strongly should be cfi'd So

376
00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:35.740
Tim Beiko: we have 7, 8, 2, 5, 7, 9, 0, 7.

377
00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:51.369
Tim Beiko: Okay, if not, then. Yeah. Hadrian has been waiting for a couple of calls to present any. IP, yeah, you wanna go ahead.

378
00:51:53.270 --> 00:52:01.090
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Yes, thank you, please. Can someone else want to go ahead first, st and I can find somewhere where I can speak pretty because I cannot be in 5 min.

379
00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:01.590
Tim Beiko: Okay?

380
00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:09.150
Tim Beiko: Okay? Well, then, in that case, unders had one. And I think Onsgar had another related proposal. So let's do those, and then we'll do Patreon

381
00:52:12.550 --> 00:52:15.770
Tim Beiko: and is Anders on the call. I probably saw him in chat

382
00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.540
Tim Beiko: is on theirs.

383
00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:28.970
Anders Elowsson: Oh, yeah, hello, yeah. Yeah. Hey, okay, yeah.

384
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:39.369
Anders Elowsson: Okay. So I used to give a rationale for the Ipa. So so essentially so, the price of blob space is determined by the price of of the blobs, you know, controlled by the blaze fee.

385
00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:43.609
Tim Beiko: Eip what's the number? Sorry? 7, 9, 18, right?

386
00:52:43.610 --> 00:52:45.020
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.

387
00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:46.210
Tim Beiko: But yeah.

388
00:52:46.210 --> 00:53:10.780
Anders Elowsson: So the price is determined by the price of the blobs, you know, controlled by the blob-based fee and the price of the blob current transaction. So a simple demand function, then, is quantity of blobs demanded as a function of the blob-based fee and the cost of the execution gas. The current fee market does not operate on this demand function. It only accounts for the blob-based fee, and because of this the fee update range becomes insignificant when the T-sco dominates.

389
00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:36.550
Anders Elowsson: So the fee market then stops operating correctly and fails to converge on an equilibrium. So you end up in this situation, where the base fee may increase by 10% per slot, because the blob space is increased by 0 point 0 0 1% per slot trying to attain equilibrium, which, of course, is not happening, because the Tx cost dominates. And so this Ap. Resolves this by stopping the blob-based fee from falling further when it no longer has a dominant role in influencing demand.

390
00:53:36.660 --> 00:54:00.919
Anders Elowsson: and this is achieved by adding an if statement to the calculus block gas function. So if it is cost, Dominus do not subtract target block gas and instead increase excess block gas moderately depending on gas usage and otherwise proceed as normal. So I was thinking that considering for cycle will scale global space a lot. You know, this is a simple change that can be done at the functional free market.

391
00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:05.300
Tim Beiko: Thank you.

392
00:54:06.620 --> 00:54:12.200
Tim Beiko: Any thoughts, comments on this. I know. Onskar, you had the another proposal.

393
00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:19.431
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, maybe I mean, I, I can give just just for context, right? So basically,

394
00:54:19.930 --> 00:54:47.159
Ansgar Dietrichs: the observation has been for a while that the Blob Fee market is a little bit inefficient in that, that the price, whenever there's not enough demand, hovers around at one way, and then it just takes a very long time to ramp up, and there was this very simple erp to fix to address this by. Originally Max Resnick, and then David and I kind of took that over now that Max is busy with other things and other ecosystems.

395
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:57.209
Ansgar Dietrichs: and that would just set a kind of constant floor that's still very, very cheap, but just closer to the reasonable range, so that it doesn't always take so long to ramp up.

396
00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:12.429
Ansgar Dietrichs: And this is kind of proposal now that he just proposed that came out of very recent work by him. And that's a bit more nuanced. Basically, the idea is to say, well, every every layer 2 that wants to use blobs has to send a

397
00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:35.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: normal transaction anyway, blob transaction. And so it already pays normal gas price. And so most of the time that completely dominates the price of the blobs. And so why don't we just use that as like the floor of the blob fee as well, I think that personally is very reasonable. The only downside I see is that it's well. 2 downsides there, I see one is that it's a bit more complex, at least conceptually. And also, I think.

398
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:50.090
Ansgar Dietrichs: not necessarily has had that much review. Yet of that mechanism, although it feels like that should be a reasonable approach. Yeah. And and basically, the other one is just that it that's been like a very recent proposal. So

399
00:55:50.416 --> 00:56:18.510
Ansgar Dietrichs: I, personally would be fine with either of those 2. And there's this more principled solution, or maybe these, this original Max Resnick proposal. That's a bit simpler, I think. Given that with pierdas. We will have so many more blobs, and probably we will have quite a few of these moments where otherwise the fee will basically be be in kind of unfortunate, unfortunately unresponsive areas. So I would hope to at least chip one of the 2. They're both specs wise, super, super simple.

400
00:56:18.570 --> 00:56:32.480
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maybe the the best given that we want to freeze pfi, like like Cfi today. What we could do is we could move both of those 2 to Cfi and have wait for a recommendation of which of the 2 to use over the next

401
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:37.859
Ansgar Dietrichs: 2 weeks, or something. Yeah. Otherwise I'd personally be happy for us to to go with either.

402
00:56:39.940 --> 00:56:44.489
Tim Beiko: Thank you. Yeah. Anyone have thoughts or comments on this.

403
00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:49.420
Tim Beiko: Yeah, Ben.

404
00:56:50.168 --> 00:56:57.420
Ben Adams: I I do like the new proposal over the prior one. Because

405
00:56:58.130 --> 00:57:08.299
Ben Adams: I think the prime one makes sense, because one way is like a crazy price. So you never launched a token at one way, because Uniswap wouldn't be able to do the math.

406
00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:20.260
Ben Adams: But the the new proposal is less arbitrary. It's it's actually responding to the few markets. So it is.

407
00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:22.487
Ben Adams: it feels better.

408
00:57:24.500 --> 00:57:25.819
Ben Adams: It's got good vibes.

409
00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:35.570
Tim Beiko: I guess. Yeah. One thing I would hope is that people

410
00:57:36.050 --> 00:57:38.829
Tim Beiko: like before we make this decision, we've actually

411
00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:42.813
Tim Beiko: like reviewed it fairly thoroughly.

412
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:54.270
Tim Beiko: Both of these seem like relatively minor spec changes like only a few lines. If we feel like we need more time to think about it.

413
00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:57.060
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I would probably see if I

414
00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:02.820
Tim Beiko: either both or like one of them. But, like definitely take like

415
00:58:03.090 --> 00:58:12.870
Tim Beiko: reserve the rights to change whatever the the curve is or the the formula is to make sure it's correct. Assuming that, like the

416
00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:21.291
Tim Beiko: you know, the amount of work or the like complexity of implementation doesn't significantly change.

417
00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:45.339
Anders Elowsson: Yeah. So it's I can mention one thing there, that is that it depends on how the are gonna implement. If they're gonna have a cap on. You know the the number of blobs you can sign send in a transaction, or if there's not gonna be a cap and depending on if there's a cap or not, you can have 2 different settings for this. So that's something we would adapt with. Whatever the the final option is.

418
00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:55.399
Tim Beiko: Okay? Yeah. Does anyone?

419
00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:01.780
Tim Beiko: Yeah, does anyone feel like we should not? Cfi 7, 9, 1, 8.

420
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:06.959
Tim Beiko: It seems like there's relatively broad support for that. I'm not sure. About 7, 7, 6, 2,

421
00:59:07.550 --> 00:59:10.759
Tim Beiko: but yeah, 7, 9, 1, 8 seems

422
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:16.860
Tim Beiko: probably supported. And again we'd have. We'll have to like review the curve and potentially tweak it, but

423
00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:18.599
Tim Beiko: probably go in that direction.

424
00:59:23.740 --> 00:59:31.029
Tim Beiko: Okay, so that's Cfi 7, 9, 1, 8. Does anyone want to push for 7, 7, 6, 2 being Cfi as well. Then.

425
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:37.130
Tim Beiko: it's yeah.

426
00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:44.590
Tim Beiko: Yeah. Worst case. At the last minute we could swap them out if we realize that it was a much better design.

427
00:59:45.076 --> 00:59:48.970
Dankrad Feist: I'm I prefer. Cfi. 7, 7, 6, 2,

428
00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:55.819
Dankrad Feist: I mean, I'm not. I wasn't really aware of 7, 9, 1 8. But I am, I

429
00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:10.180
Dankrad Feist: don't like the argument. Oh, no, we need to do something super neutral, blah blah, or something. We should just do the right thing, and to me at least 7, 7, 6, 2 feels more like the right thing than something else. I mean, I'll have a deeper look at that. But I.

430
01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:10.800
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

431
01:00:11.850 --> 01:00:18.500
Dankrad Feist: Think min base fee is what we really want. What is the natural economic thing to do?

432
01:00:19.276 --> 01:00:23.270
Dankrad Feist: And yeah, that's my opinion.

433
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:30.769
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I guess there's no. There's no world where we ship the 2 of these like they're mutually exclusive. So I think it's effectively

434
01:00:31.130 --> 01:00:38.930
Tim Beiko: free to Cfi both if we like. If we think there's a chance we might do 7, 7, 6, 2, we should just Cfi as well, and then

435
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:46.069
Tim Beiko: we'll we'll choose one of the 2 that we actually implement. But yeah, anyone disagree with that.

436
01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:52.390
Anders Elowsson: One thing I'd like to understand. If the base fee force say a lot.

437
01:00:52.680 --> 01:01:09.109
Anders Elowsson: You know, the the execution basically falls a lot, because the. That's what I don't understand. Why, why we would like to have a high higher floor on the blob, basically than than the execution. Basically, if, if, for example, if for some reason the execution basically falls a lot.

438
01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.510
Dankrad Feist: Yeah, I mean, I think it's a fair argument to simply say, we want to

439
01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.160
Dankrad Feist: flow on both. I would also be pro having a higher execution policy.

440
01:01:23.327 --> 01:01:25.062
Tim Beiko: One comment from the chat,

441
01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:30.745
Tim Beiko: is like, yeah, this assumes both of these are relatively trivial to implement.

442
01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:42.550
Tim Beiko: anyone have concerns about that like, it seems to me like they're both fairly small changes, and relatively equal in size. But yeah.

443
01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:47.240
Tim Beiko: is that, does anyone feel like that's not the case.

444
01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:51.370
Tim Beiko: Okay?

445
01:01:52.270 --> 01:02:08.299
Tim Beiko: Okay? If not, then like, yeah, let's see if I both of them. And yes, we should have a deeper discussions about each of each of them. I don't know if we want to have a breakout call or if there's a is there a channel in the R&D discord. Actually, where we can

446
01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:17.350
Tim Beiko: move this conversation to do you have like a free market channel or something?

447
01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:19.820
Tim Beiko: We do not.

448
01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:29.789
Tim Beiko: okay. So I after this call, I'll figure out somewhere where we can continue this discussion forward. But I think for now Cfi and the 2 of them makes sense.

449
01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:39.000
Tim Beiko: Heydrien, let's do, Adrian, and then Barnabas will get to your question. Hadrian.

450
01:02:39.750 --> 01:02:41.720
Tim Beiko: yeah. Do you want to present your IP.

451
01:02:42.180 --> 01:03:01.600
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Yeah. So thank you for giving me this opportunity. I'd like to speak about 7, 8, 1 9 unlike the other one that was discussed. It's not about fixing incentives or or improving the blockchain behavior, but more about like, Oh, yeah, let me think.

452
01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.420
Trent: Hey! Adrian.

453
01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:04.390
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): In regards, yeah.

454
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:08.740
Trent: You're in a you're in a very echoey room, so maybe get closer to your mic.

455
01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:09.910
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Yeah.

456
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.989
Trent: Go to a room with less echo, and then people will hear you better.

457
01:03:12.990 --> 01:03:15.610
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Okay, I'm I'm outside right now. Is that better?

458
01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:16.910
Trent: Yes, very much.

459
01:03:16.910 --> 01:03:20.600
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Okay. I'm sorry I'm at the maternity. My baby was just born this morning.

460
01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:21.540
Trent: Congrats.

461
01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:39.500
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): So so yeah. So, as I was saying, maybe you haven't heard me. Eip 1729. It's really about the developer experience and improving how contracts are built. It's not about fixing incentive like gloves or things like that. So I don't think there is any big urgency in shipping that

462
01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:42.069
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): so the idea of this vip

463
01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:54.200
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): is that 7, 7 0, 2 created this new object. The delegation for Ua, which I believe is extremely powerful, and the idea of this IP is to have smart contract benefit from it.

464
01:03:54.370 --> 01:04:02.040
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): and the idea is that I would like more contract to be able to create these objects that have, in my opinion, external properties.

465
01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:08.239
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): These properties are that they're very small. They are just the size of a 7 7 0, 2 delegation

466
01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:24.980
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): the redirect call very efficiently like a proxy would do, but they can be upgradable by just changing the code like 7,702 allows for Eos without having to rely on like the target implementation being in storage and required unless load to be updated.

467
01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:29.468
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Another benefit from having this implemented is that

468
01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:45.629
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): explorers like it, or scan, and so on, wouldn't have to handle the many, many versions of the byte code that exist for both proxy and Clones, and it would just look like 7,702 delegation that are clearly to understand and to and to analyze.

469
01:04:45.820 --> 01:05:02.989
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): So the reason I'm proposing it right now is that I believe that this feature is really great for the long term development of more contracts in particular, like using the clone pattern. That is way more efficient in terms of storage for for the blockchain, and and make that more widely available.

470
01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:09.710
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): And with the change to Eos it's unclear to me. What's the right moment to propose something like that?

471
01:05:09.860 --> 01:05:32.160
Hadrien Croubois (OpenZeppelin): Basically, my fear would be that with a Max Us. Shipping soon we would be in a situation where new features like this one would take a very, very long time to get into like a version 2 or us, or something like that. So I'd like people to to consider it, and to and to give feedback about this proposal. But I understand that for Fussaka it may not be the right schedule.

472
01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:41.289
Tim Beiko: Thank you. Anyone have comments or, yeah thoughts about this.

473
01:05:47.330 --> 01:05:54.870
Marius: I don't really understand the Pr. The Ap. I kind of get the gist of it.

474
01:05:55.465 --> 01:06:00.680
Marius: But I don't think it should be done in Fusaka. To be honest, it's a it's

475
01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.569
Marius: as I. It's the way I see it. It's kind of a nice change.

476
01:06:05.812 --> 01:06:10.210
Marius: but I don't think this is like we have

477
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:21.409
Marius: already so much included today. Again, that I think we should. We should do this in in the fog afterwards.

478
01:06:30.730 --> 01:06:32.649
Tim Beiko: Anyone else have.

479
01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:33.660
Tim Beiko: But

480
01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:50.370
Tim Beiko: okay, so won't be moving this to Cfi today, I believe.

481
01:06:51.690 --> 01:06:59.573
Tim Beiko: Thank you, Adrian, and hopefully, you can get back to the maternity ward.

482
01:07:00.290 --> 01:07:01.060
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

483
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:09.282
Tim Beiko: Yeah. And like, yes, we can add this to Eos in A in a different port.

484
01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:18.470
Tim Beiko: okay. So Barnabas had a comment about the deadline for ssifying things for Fusaka. I think.

485
01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:22.849
Tim Beiko: Yes, the the way I I would approach it is

486
01:07:23.210 --> 01:07:41.910
Tim Beiko: what we want as a bar for Sfi is what we're willing to include in the next devnet. We probably shouldn't be including things until what we have on the devnet or what we have already. Sfi is stable. In this case it means we have peered us and eof

487
01:07:42.030 --> 01:08:00.859
Tim Beiko: we should be focusing on those getting a def net that runs both of them. And then, once we have that, then I think we can, we should make a call about okay. How far do you know? How far do we think we are from the fork? And what can we realistically include there? And without causing much delays?

488
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:06.510
Tim Beiko: I think a lot of the things we've Cfid are relatively simple changes. And so.

489
01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:17.027
Tim Beiko: you know, potentially, we want to add a couple of them to say, like Devnet, one of Fusaka that has eof peer dos running smoothly, and then we had a few things.

490
01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:20.799
Tim Beiko: but that would kind of be the approach I would take

491
01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:42.299
Tim Beiko: to do this rather than like a specific deadline. If our goal is to ship pure Das as soon as possible, then we should have our engineering focused on that. If the 1st thing we've prioritized alongside with pure das is eof, then we should make sure that that works. So this is well tested. And when that's the case, and we feel like there's some extra bandwidth we make a call about what we bring in.

492
01:08:43.830 --> 01:08:46.830
Tim Beiko: I don't know if we want to like. Set some sort of

493
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:50.899
Tim Beiko: more stringent date. My fear is, if we do this, then we just end up

494
01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:55.987
Tim Beiko: breaking it, or it ends up being kind of a a useless state.

495
01:08:56.630 --> 01:09:00.850
Tim Beiko: and that the thing that kind of bottlenecks us as we're working on the fork is

496
01:09:01.290 --> 01:09:04.250
Tim Beiko: like implementation stability on the devnet. So

497
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.569
Tim Beiko: yeah, that would be my approach. I don't know if

498
01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:11.229
Tim Beiko: anyone has opinions or thoughts on this.

499
01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.680
Tim Beiko: Okay?

500
01:09:25.819 --> 01:09:32.939
Tim Beiko: And so, as of now, the stuff we have Sfi in in

501
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:41.720
Tim Beiko: Fusaka. Sorry is Peerdas, and this list of Eof eips from Devnet 0 and devnet one for eof

502
01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:53.990
Tim Beiko: that should be teams priorities. Then for the Cfi section we have this. Rip 7, 2, 1, 2, which we'll have to change due to this this bug that Carl mentioned.

503
01:09:53.990 --> 01:10:17.000
Tim Beiko: we have another set of Eofeps. The MoD Xp gas increase. The transaction cap limit. S078-25-7907 the other limits around the or sorry the metering of the contract code size and then increasing the contract code limit. And we'll have to do the initial the in its code addition.

504
01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:35.341
Tim Beiko: we have these 2 eips with regards to the Blob fee market, 7, 9, 18 and 7, 7, 6, 2, that we both want to consider, and then the other thing that we kind of mentioned but don't quite have an eip for is this idea around the gas limit?

505
01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:36.950
Tim Beiko: and

506
01:10:37.260 --> 01:10:49.129
Tim Beiko: we sort of landed on. Maybe we should have just an informational eip about this that we can also include so I do think we should draft this. And even though our sort of

507
01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:55.290
Tim Beiko: formal deadline was today like that feels like an important conversation to have

508
01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:59.800
Tim Beiko: So on the el side. I guess.

509
01:11:00.383 --> 01:11:02.550
Tim Beiko: The people feel like there's

510
01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:06.040
Tim Beiko: anything important or critical that's missing from this list.

511
01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:09.360
Ben Adams: How.

512
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:10.140
Tim Beiko: Yes.

513
01:11:10.530 --> 01:11:16.080
Ben Adams: 1 1 thing that's come up, but there isn't an aip for it is. Do we want to limit

514
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:19.340
Ben Adams: the number of blobs per transaction.

515
01:11:20.549 --> 01:11:31.390
Ben Adams: So the blob per block. Obviously, that's decided. But do we want a single transaction to be able to use all the blocks like if if we're up to 52

516
01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:36.639
Ben Adams: blobs. Do you wanna do on a 7 MB transaction?

517
01:11:42.252 --> 01:11:43.850
Tim Beiko: Mary says, yes.

518
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:54.100
Ben Adams: And then question is, do we want it in 2 second.

519
01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.040
Tim Beiko: So.

520
01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:02.860
Marius: If we're planning to increase the blobs again in Fusaka.

521
01:12:03.530 --> 01:12:05.220
Marius: I think we should have this.

522
01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.860
Tim Beiko: So do we need an eip for this.

523
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:15.139
lightclient: Why not just do this in the pure dot? Cip.

524
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.855
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

525
01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:24.849
Marius: Yeah, that's kind of what we've been debating. So we will probably do this in the Peter Cip.

526
01:12:25.370 --> 01:12:29.109
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I think I mean, if we need another eip.

527
01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:36.850
Tim Beiko: we can just have it. But I I think if it's just a part of pure das. It makes sense to just include it in that spec.

528
01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:44.699
Marius: Yeah, it. It just felt kind of a bit off to decide this within the.

529
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:45.740
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

530
01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:51.820
Marius: Within the Peters group and not inform everyone else about it. So if that's okay.

531
01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.390
Tim Beiko: I guess, yeah.

532
01:12:52.390 --> 01:12:54.229
Marius: Informed about it now, so.

533
01:12:54.230 --> 01:12:56.650
Tim Beiko: Does anyone? Yeah, don't think we should have a limit.

534
01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:10.210
stokes: Yeah, I and the protocol cause we've discussed this before. If I'm following, maybe I misunderstood. But

535
01:13:10.638 --> 01:13:18.720
stokes: just capping the number of blobs per blob transaction. We've gone back and forth on this so like, it could just be like an input restriction. For example.

536
01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:23.280
Ben Adams: Yeah. But then I could build a block offline. Put a letter Ethernet

537
01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:27.380
Ben Adams: through.

538
01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:29.990
Ben Adams: Yeah, I don't know if it makes any difference.

539
01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:34.200
stokes: Yeah, I mean, if most people want it, I'm not gonna block it.

540
01:13:37.520 --> 01:13:41.460
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: I think the reason it makes more sense is because

541
01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:49.490
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: helps with mempool. So maybe having it only in mempool makes sense.

542
01:13:49.930 --> 01:13:53.830
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: If you modify the software and do up

543
01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:04.009
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: large transaction with a lot of blobs. Then it's fine. It's on you. But the important part is that the mempool will not have to suffer with these

544
01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:13.900
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: transactions that have a lot of blobs. But if there is another reason that restricting the blobs in a single transaction makes sense.

545
01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.090
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Then, yeah, that wouldn't be valid anymore.

546
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:33.919
Tim Beiko: Great. Yeah, Barnabas Onsgar. And there's are your comments about this specifically.

547
01:14:35.527 --> 01:14:38.630
Barnabas Busa: Yeah. So my comment would be that

548
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:50.100
Barnabas Busa: I would propose not to pump the blob limit in Fussaka and do it in a blob. Only update that way. We can test

549
01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:56.230
Barnabas Busa: one lesson, 1 1 less thing, basically. And it's gonna be a bit quicker for

550
01:14:56.350 --> 01:15:00.880
Barnabas Busa: us to ship it. And then we can focus on block updates.

551
01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:15.490
Tim Beiko: On on that point. Yeah. Sorry. So I missed this. But in the Cl call last week we had Cfi, the Bpo fork at eip it was just a draft. Pr, and so I I miss it did get merged. So yeah, we

552
01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:20.120
Tim Beiko: we can still decide to to activate it that way? Yeah, I'm

553
01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:24.600
Tim Beiko: yeah. Onsgar on. Theirs is just about the same topic.

554
01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:26.150
Anders Elowsson: Yeah.

555
01:15:26.150 --> 01:15:27.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: I mean, I would.

556
01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:41.000
Ansgar Dietrichs: I just wanted to say that in general we should always be more okay with doing things that can be later on revised and so given that this restriction can always be lifted later on. I, personally don't think we need it. I think the Mempool would be the simpler

557
01:15:41.250 --> 01:15:52.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: place to do that. But given that, there seems to be relatively broad support, I would say, instead of bike shedding, we should just like have it in Fusaka, and then revisit this decision like for Glam, Saddam, or something.

558
01:15:54.850 --> 01:16:10.390
Anders Elowsson: Yeah, I just wanted to pitch that. Maybe you could have this cap also vary. If you scale a lot, then a low cap may seem very small all of a sudden, so you could adopt the cap with the target.

559
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.939
Tim Beiko: Okay? So I guess yeah, just to

560
01:16:14.475 --> 01:16:33.060
Tim Beiko: not take up the rest of the call for for the implementation details here. It seems like there's broad support for a cap. We're fine doing this as part of the pure cip for now, if we were to change it in the future, then we probably want to split different eip it. Assuming this is in in protocol cap, and not a mental one. But I think we can

561
01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:38.339
Tim Beiko: define the like specifics of the cap on the peer desk breakouts. Does that seem reasonable to people?

562
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:52.660
Tim Beiko: Okay, so we won't add a new eip for this. But we may expect a change with regards to capping the blog count in transactions to be added to the pure cip

563
01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:07.402
Tim Beiko: and then, yeah. So to your earlier comment, Barnabas. You said we should see if I did. Blob parameter forks. We have done that. And yeah, my bad. I I missed the draft pr

564
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:14.260
Tim Beiko: anything else. People feel strongly about us. Cfi in today.

565
01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.560
Tim Beiko: Lynn.

566
01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:29.080
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Yeah. In last Cl call we talked about Eip 7, 9, 1, 7, which is deterministic

567
01:17:29.290 --> 01:17:30.440
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: proposing, look ahead.

568
01:17:30.940 --> 01:17:32.930
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: And, oh, is this.

569
01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:41.139
Tim Beiko: I was gonna say, yeah, if- if for that vip. So I yeah, I should have been clear. But I think for that vip, I would make a call on next week's consensus. There, call and.

570
01:17:41.140 --> 01:17:41.780
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Okay.

571
01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:52.400
Tim Beiko: Yeah. So today, I I think if we can finalize the El IP today, that'd be ideal. But then I know that there's this one. And there's, I think, a couple of other ones. We need to finalize on the Cl call next week.

572
01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:53.590
Lin Oshitani | Nethermind: Okay, okay, got it. Thanks.

573
01:17:53.590 --> 01:18:09.189
stokes: Yeah, maybe just a quick comment. Here, yeah, let's talk about this next week and then homework for sale. Devs would just be to look at the cip, and you know, to the extent you can do due diligence around complexity. That would be super helpful for the conversation next week.

574
01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.160
Tim Beiko: Okay.

575
01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:15.530
Tim Beiko: And Charles.

576
01:18:17.530 --> 01:18:20.190
Charles C: Hi, I am

577
01:18:21.190 --> 01:18:30.580
Charles C: drafted a eip to change memory pricing from quadratic to, I guess some per page. Eip 79, 23.

578
01:18:31.128 --> 01:18:36.380
Charles C: I didn't get it out the door soon enough for the cutoff 2 weeks ago. But

579
01:18:37.016 --> 01:18:37.750
Charles C: if it's

580
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:43.120
Charles C: I'd like for it to be considered, at least for Fusaka, but at least kick off the discussion about it.

581
01:18:43.230 --> 01:18:43.939
Charles C: So yeah.

582
01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.889
Tim Beiko: Yeah. So for oh, you mean for Fusaka or for Amsterdam.

583
01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:51.390
Charles C: Right, if not for Fusaka. Then the next hard fork.

584
01:18:51.610 --> 01:18:57.740
Tim Beiko: Yeah. So I think, yeah, because no one has had time to review it. And we're already past the deadline. I I don't think we should

585
01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.500
Tim Beiko: chat about it on the call today. If people feel like it's urgent

586
01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:09.644
Tim Beiko: to include it in Fusaka, we can bring it up, but then, otherwise I would default to just having this in the Amsterdam conversation.

587
01:19:10.350 --> 01:19:11.670
Tim Beiko: Does that seem reasonable?

588
01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:20.429
Charles C: Yeah. On a related note. I am wondering if there is ever any time to have like a meta discussion about

589
01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:26.410
Charles C: how eips get proposed, because for people who aren't.

590
01:19:26.950 --> 01:19:27.340
Tim Beiko: Yes.

591
01:19:27.340 --> 01:19:28.870
Charles C: Process. It's like

592
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:30.720
Charles C: There's like a

593
01:19:31.170 --> 01:19:38.099
Charles C: 2 to 4 week window at seemingly random times where we can propose things, and it's very easy to miss the window.

594
01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.040
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I agree. And I

595
01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:48.491
Tim Beiko: I wanted to chat about this. Today. I'm not sure we'll have the time, but if not, then I think on on next the next call we should get into this

596
01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:58.160
Tim Beiko: and I think part of the reason for for Fusaka specifically why this window was smaller, and and it's probably fine to keep it small, is

597
01:19:58.390 --> 01:19:59.910
Tim Beiko: Fusaka was

598
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:26.421
Tim Beiko: effectively Petra 2, and the overall, like agreements across grand teams was, we want to have something that's small in scope, and that ships quickly, and we kind of overloaded the 1st fork too much that we had to split it into 2 but I think for Glamsterdam, we definitely need to make this much clearer. And then there's a point around which conversations we have want to have on the call versus like Async, and how to coordinate that

599
01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:34.370
Tim Beiko: But yeah, I wanna make sure we can at least move forward with the Fusaka scope today before getting into how we plan the next work

600
01:20:35.500 --> 01:20:36.320
Tim Beiko: done.

601
01:20:37.268 --> 01:20:48.420
Ben Adams: Sorry to go back to an early issue, and I know you accepted the Pr. But the sorry the change in the peer desk proposal. But the reason for also having a Max

602
01:20:48.760 --> 01:21:00.599
Ben Adams: cap on transaction blobs per transactions is because there is a cap on blobs, and it makes them harder to pack. So if you if you did a 40, if everybody did 48

603
01:21:01.050 --> 01:21:03.889
Ben Adams: blob transactions and it was a 52

604
01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:15.410
Ben Adams: cap, then you can only fit one of those in, whereas if they're broken up, then you can more efficiently pack the transactions in. So you and you'd you'd end up with the lower amount of blobs

605
01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.689
Ben Adams: if we didn't have a number.

606
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:27.005
Tim Beiko: Okay?

607
01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.690
Tim Beiko: yeah, can we discuss this on the pure breakout or Async, just so can move forward with proseca here.

608
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.380
Tim Beiko: And okay, thanks.

609
01:21:40.420 --> 01:21:46.030
Tim Beiko: Okay. Last, call on like client teams, strong opinions for Cfi.

610
01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:48.170
Tim Beiko: I think we've gone through most of them.

611
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.139
Tim Beiko: If there's nothing else, then what I would like to like explicitly go over is

612
01:21:55.490 --> 01:21:58.910
Tim Beiko: the El proposals that we

613
01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:06.681
Tim Beiko: effectively won't be doing this work just so that we can provide clarity to people. So of the Pfi list.

614
01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:32.917
Tim Beiko: the El ones that we're not gonna be doing include 7, 6, 6, which is Evm, define the identity. Precompile 7, 6, 6, 8, removing the bloom filters. 7, 6, 8, 8. The SSD for compatible. Sorry. This one's a Cl. One. We can make that call next week. 7, 7, 3, 2 scl

615
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:39.219
Tim Beiko: Then 7, 7, 8, 3 is not a

616
01:22:40.010 --> 01:22:43.087
Tim Beiko: is not a core eip, but I don't think

617
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:46.240
Tim Beiko: So I don't think we see if I did. So.

618
01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.780
Tim Beiko: yeah, we wouldn't be doing that at least

619
01:22:49.150 --> 01:23:01.599
Tim Beiko: in a in a coordinated way. 7, 7, 9, 1 gas to East Opcode. Not doing that. 7, 7, 9, 3. They precompile to get the index of transactions within blocks.

620
01:23:02.050 --> 01:23:15.489
Tim Beiko: 7, 8 0. 5. Fossil. 7, 8, 19 to create delegate OP. Code that Hadrian presented. 7, 8, 2, 3, the upper bounds for MoD. Exp.

621
01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:24.639
Tim Beiko: 7, 8, 4, 3 at the current slot number 7, 8, 9, emitting logs on revert,

622
01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:36.663
Tim Beiko: 7, 8, 9, 8, and coupling the execution payload from the beacon block. 7, 9 0, 3 removing the init code size limit.

623
01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:45.020
Tim Beiko: 7, 9, 1 7. We'll discuss next week, 7, 9, 18, we Cfi and then 7, 19. We're not doing either.

624
01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:51.319
Tim Beiko: So I will. Dfi, basically all the ones that are el

625
01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:58.379
Tim Beiko: that are El, that are not Cfi, and then we'll do the same thing next week for the Cl. Side.

626
01:23:58.750 --> 01:23:59.540
Tim Beiko: and it.

627
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:06.263
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Marius brought up in chat that we thought we did both of them on exp, and I had thought we had done that too, because both

628
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:07.550
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: 2 clients.

629
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:13.310
Tim Beiko: So no. So we didn't. Yeah. So we didn't. So 7, 8, 2, 3, we did not. Cfi yet. Do we want to do that?

630
01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:19.389
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Yeah, basically, with another mind, we're in favor of it. And Epsilon is also in favor of it, because it solves a whole lot of problems.

631
01:24:19.980 --> 01:24:20.590
Tim Beiko: Okay.

632
01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:22.750
Tim Beiko: And this is just adding your bound.

633
01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:26.269
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Yes, talking it out at 4,096.

634
01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.620
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

635
01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.740
Danno Ferrin | Ipsilon: Bytes, which is sufficient for any Rsa signature.

636
01:24:30.570 --> 01:24:35.610
Tim Beiko: Okay, does anyone disagree with Cfa? I think that one.

637
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:41.860
Tim Beiko: Okay.

638
01:24:42.370 --> 01:24:59.799
Tim Beiko: So then that would be the last that we Cfid, all the other ones I mentioned that are el specific, we would we would decline for this fork, and then on the Cl call. Next week we will go through the similar process and get us to our final list of Cfid eips

639
01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.290
Tim Beiko: Anything else on Fusaka scoping.

640
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.740
Tim Beiko: Okay?

641
01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:25.476
Tim Beiko: then. Yeah, we have 10 min left. I shared this proposal last week on the chat around, reconfiguring all core devs.

642
01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:33.399
Tim Beiko: In short, the idea is that we are now working on different forks in parallel, and we kind of mix

643
01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:57.239
Tim Beiko: 2 concerns like implementation details of the current fork with planning of the next fork. And clearly, as we discussed like we could do a better job of coordinating on the planning side, both in terms of figuring out what's the most important thing in the fork. Why is that important? Who does it affects? And how important is that? And also.

644
01:25:57.637 --> 01:26:04.800
Tim Beiko: like, yeah, having more focus on the implementation of current fork. So the proposal would be to

645
01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:26.330
Tim Beiko: basically split awkward dev such that the existing testing calls that happen every Monday that Terry and Mario been running would become the effectively. Acdt was my name awkward as testing where we discuss the current fork so effectively the Petra portion of today's call. And then

646
01:26:26.730 --> 01:26:43.350
Tim Beiko: awkward devs acde and Acdc would be only focused on looking at the next fork. And what this means is we would have more time on these calls to discuss, like at a high level, what should be the most important

647
01:26:43.350 --> 01:27:01.590
Tim Beiko: thing to do in a fork. So, for example, for Glamsterdam we 1st start with like, Okay, what is what should be like this headliner for the fork? What should the fork be about? And ideally get to hear from a broader set of the community as part of this. So we could bring in, you know, representatives from

648
01:27:02.019 --> 01:27:11.190
Tim Beiko: you know, app development compiler teams and whatnot to try and figure out, okay, what is the most important thing to ship for ethereum? And then,

649
01:27:11.670 --> 01:27:21.430
Tim Beiko: once we agree on that. What's like the right eip for it. And then, once we agree on that, what are the other things we can include alongside kind of like we did today.

650
01:27:22.115 --> 01:27:45.660
Tim Beiko: There's a lot of implementation details to figure out. But I think the 1st step is agreeing to doing this or not, and in practice. What this would look like, I think, is that once Petra goes, live. Then this call would just focus on Amsterdam, and all of the Fusaka conversation would happen in the testing call.

651
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:49.590
Tim Beiko: and the one, I guess the one caveat there is that

652
01:27:49.890 --> 01:28:12.171
Tim Beiko: this assumes the scope stays fixed. But I think if we are, you know, if we're working on Fusaka, and we realize that we need to add an eip removing the IP or whatever it would still make sense to bring it up on this call. Just a sanity check. But yeah, that. Given a forks like a fixed fork scope. We would just move forward.

653
01:28:12.900 --> 01:28:18.859
Tim Beiko: like, yeah, with with that. And so basically, like, yeah, to the Cfi comment, my point would be like

654
01:28:19.260 --> 01:28:27.003
Tim Beiko: anything that's Sfi kind of moves to the testing call. But then moving stuff from Cfi to Sfi is probably still something we want to do here.

655
01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:28.210
Tim Beiko: yeah.

656
01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:41.250
Tim Beiko: And I, yeah, to pull this other comment. It's like it'll be impossible to avoid. I think that's probably true. Like I I don't think it should be like a fully, you know. Like.

657
01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:58.269
Tim Beiko: if we need to ship Fusaka to ship to Amsterdam, so we shouldn't just like naively, fully ignore it. If there is something that we can accelerate by spending a few minutes on the calls talking about it. That's good. But the main purpose of this call should be, you know, Glamsterdam going forward. And then

658
01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:21.633
Tim Beiko: this means, if you're working on Fusaka, the expectation is, we have everyone on the testing call there to resolve the issues. And so like. If there is something that's so urgent that we can't wake up. We can't wait a week to make a decision. We should obviously bring it up on the Cl or El call, but my expectation is like 90 to 95% or more of the things would just be handled there.

659
01:29:23.370 --> 01:29:26.619
Tim Beiko: but yeah, for this, you wanna share more.

660
01:29:26.620 --> 01:29:47.730
Potuz: Just something, and you said it. But I just wanted to be explicit. Is that, there's no going to be any decisions making outside of this call of what actually goes into the port like if there's discussions about the things that were Cfi and that are apparently ready to be included. That's this is a decision that is not going to be made on the testing calls.

661
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:52.519
Tim Beiko: Correct. So like, yeah, the testing call effectively works with, like the set of Sfid Ips.

662
01:29:52.770 --> 01:30:02.720
Tim Beiko: And look at some point like, you know, there might be some weird boundaries like, for example, this blob transaction cap we discussed, and people can use their judgments on those. But

663
01:30:02.910 --> 01:30:05.390
Tim Beiko: you know, say, we start working on Fusaka.

664
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:22.410
Tim Beiko: We're not gonna add Epbs to Fusaka on the testing call, like, if we wanted to do something like that, or even, you know, add, like the pre compile, or whatever. Even if it's a minor eip, we would still make this call here. But then, once that's set, and we know what we're working on

665
01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:26.299
Tim Beiko: like the implementation coordination moves to the testing call.

666
01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:29.620
Tim Beiko: Reddick.

667
01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:35.539
Radek: Yeah. So just thinking that

668
01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:50.829
Radek: talking about future forks is something that we haven't been doing that much. So this is my understanding of to talk more about it. So it's adding more things to, you know, to Acde, Acdc or basically to our agenda.

669
01:30:50.880 --> 01:31:12.100
Radek: And so if we push both Icde and Ecdc topics about the current fork to one testing call. It may be that we won't be able to fit everything into 90 min, so I see we will see how it plays out. But I'm just, you know, worried a little bit. That one testing call for everything might be not sufficient.

670
01:31:12.650 --> 01:31:22.059
Tim Beiko: So the testing call is every week. And right now it's like an hour a week, most of the time. We don't use the entire hour. So, and we spent, I don't know.

671
01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:25.900
Tim Beiko: like sometime on extra today, but.

672
01:31:26.260 --> 01:31:26.600
Marius: But.

673
01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:28.660
Tim Beiko: Not a ton. So I I think.

674
01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:29.840
Marius: We can start with.

675
01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:31.969
Tim Beiko: That and see how it goes. Yeah.

676
01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:32.870
Marius: Okay.

677
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:35.780
Radek: It's every week sorry. Yeah, if it's every week. Then I think it's fine.

678
01:31:36.630 --> 01:31:49.650
Marius: But we're also only not using the whole hour, because there's only like 30 people attending. Probably when we make this official. And there's like 80 people attending. Then we might

679
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:50.400
Marius: take me.

680
01:31:50.400 --> 01:32:03.549
Tim Beiko: Yeah, yeah, and look like, maybe we can play with the structure and whatnot. And you know, maybe this call ends up being an hour, because we have less to discuss, and the other call is 90 min or whatever like I, I think we should be flexible. But my sense is

681
01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:15.020
Tim Beiko: like, yeah, I would not start with more than one call a week. And one note, actually, like, yeah, we haven't been like streaming and recording the testing calls now, and we will start doing that as part of this. So

682
01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.179
Tim Beiko: yeah, how'd it go.

683
01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:29.040
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah. And I just wanted to very briefly give a shout out to also this new. These new research calls that that. And I kind of recently launched. We had the 1st one

684
01:32:29.564 --> 01:32:43.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: just the other day where we talked a bit about local building, and we will have a second one on May 7, th and I think those can actually fill nicely. Fill this gap of like, start talking about these like somewhat further out topics.

685
01:32:43.270 --> 01:33:01.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: not to replace a conversation about this. Of course, Ok. Will still kind of like talk about them once we are very close to making decisions about them, but I think it can give a bit of an advanced space for at least some of these higher level topics, so that it maybe takes a bit away. A little bit of the pressure from from having to

686
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.679
Ansgar Dietrichs: to have this this more vision side conversation, as well.

687
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:18.106
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I definitely agree with this, like, my rough mental model, is like the research call should think in years and like, what are the things on the horizon for ethereum. And where should we be spending more or less of our efforts?

688
01:33:18.700 --> 01:33:34.643
Tim Beiko: Awkward devs on the Cl. And El. Side should focus on like months, like, what do we want in the next work? And why is this important? And then the the testing call should focus on weeks, like, how do we get the specific Pr implemented?

689
01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.309
Tim Beiko: And then, yeah, to Lucas's comment on attendance, like, I think

690
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:48.529
Tim Beiko: teams should have people at all like at all these calls, but it doesn't have to be the same. People like there are people who

691
01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:59.465
Tim Beiko: maybe don't want to spend the year talking about what's gonna go in the next fork and would rather talk about how we're implementing the thing in this fork and vice versa. So

692
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:09.420
Tim Beiko: yeah, if you want to be part of every single conversation. Then. Yes, you will attend more calls, but I think teams can also assign different people for different parts of the process.

693
01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.799
Tim Beiko: I'm Trent, you had a comment.

694
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:22.339
Trent: Yeah, this is just about Petra pages. So I can go at the end. If people have final comments about.

695
01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:38.892
Tim Beiko: Yeah, so I guess yeah, just to wrap this conversation up. It seems like everyone is in favor. I haven't heard any like major objections. So I think we should start this like next month. Once Petra goes goes live, and we effectively move this over to

696
01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:44.988
Tim Beiko: to like a Glamsterdam planning, there'll be a bunch of minor issues to figure out. But

697
01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:51.001
Tim Beiko: I'll assume that if I haven't heard any objections by like the Cl. Call next week.

698
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:58.970
Tim Beiko: everyone has reviewed the proposal and is happy with it. And you know, module figuring out some details. We're moving ahead.

699
01:35:01.670 --> 01:35:03.259
Tim Beiko: Yeah, okay, Trent.

700
01:35:04.630 --> 01:35:24.455
Trent: Some of you may have already gotten messages about this, but just wanted to broadcast it again. In years past we've done these sort of compilations of core contributor perspectives. We did it for the launch of the beacon chain. We did it for the merge, and we did it again last year for Denkun, and we'd like to do it again for Petra.

701
01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:44.669
Trent: tentatively titled Petra pages the way it works. We hope it will be a complement to the team perspectives that everybody has released on what went well with Petra and what we could improve. So if you were materially involved in core development over the last year or so specifically related to Petra.

702
01:35:44.690 --> 01:36:01.380
Trent: Please do reach out to myself or Nixo. We're working on coordinating this. The deadline is April 28, th hopefully, that's enough time for people to submit. It's not a very long you can choose how much depth you put into your responses. But

703
01:36:01.790 --> 01:36:06.280
Trent: yeah, looking back on Petra things we could improve specifically.

Trent: how the process could have been handled better. But also things like any contributions that you or your team are particularly proud of somebody that you want to give a shout out to and recognize their contributions on your team or otherwise.

Trent: and something like you know, particularly nasty bugs. This is a way for you to surface things that are unique to your perspective. That may not filter up to like the high level team summary. So again reach out to myself or Nixo, if your team lead hasn't already sent you the form and submit it. By April 28.th
