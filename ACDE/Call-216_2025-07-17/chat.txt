My problem with 7907 is that it feels that there’s a better solution, not only for us devs but also for users, as an user, I don’t want to pay for a large contract access if I only want to read my balance in some token
00:18:31	Mikhail Kalinin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

Raul’s point is that v3 should be supported by ELs, nothing to do with CLs in Fusaka
00:18:32	Ansgar Dietrichs:	is it too late now to ship giulio’s EIP instead? just bump max code size from 24kb to 32kb, no pricing or other changes at all?
00:18:37	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Replying to "Also want to flag if..."

We're not opposed to eip-7907, Besu's implementation is nearly finalised, but we agree that this is the time to freeze the spec and focus on hardening for the testnets. We wouldn’t object to moving 7907 to Glamsterdam and removing it from Fusaka. The fact that we still don’t have consensus on its risks and broader consequences is a strong signal that its inclusion should be reconsidered, especially just a few days before the launch of the final Devnet 3.
00:18:46	Dustin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

that's not possible to assert sans full testing
00:19:15	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "is it too late now t..."

it's not a big enough lift, it's yolo'ing stuff without enough leverage
00:19:26	Mikhail Kalinin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

it won’t be tested by CLs. there will be a separate devnet for that after Fusaka if we accept the v3 proposal
00:19:36	pawan:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

Implementing v3 has no effect on furthering fusaka progress. It can only slow it down. I think its a waste of resources
00:19:41	draganrakita:	Replying to "is it too late now t..."

Supporting this, it is two lines change in Reth.
00:19:43	Dustin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

00:19:59	Mikhail Kalinin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

Notably: "implemented" means "has been tested" insofar as whether CLs can rely on it
00:21:13	Charles (vyper):	i think 50% increase actually has a worse effect on the total amount of code that can be loaded in a tx/block than 7907

I am fine with whatever is done with v2/v3, but this seems entirely an EL issue at this point, I think CL teams can just ignore v3 completely? So it’s not clear to me in what way it is a distraction to CL teams

If you are spending resources testing V3, you are taking away resources from testing other important stuff like malicious testing. That’s my main point
00:23:24	Dustin:	Replying to "7907 and getblobsv3"

My broader claim is, it's disingenuous to claim it's there and works unless it's been actively tested in a devnet environment
00:23:27	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "still doesn't speed ..."

And therefore it can't be assumed to work, from the CL side, anyway, during Fusaka

V3 is irrelevant for fusaka. I don’t understand why we need to implement it today. getBlobsV1 was also prototyped and implemented outside of a fork. Its easy to add later when we have time

From the PR to revert partial responses, 
 
if the request is `[A_versioned_hash, B_versioned_hash, C_versioned_hash]` and client software has data for blobs `A` and `C`, but doesn't have data for `B`, the response **MUST** be `null`.

so depends:for snap sync, yes we will request them, and at some point of MGas/s there are EDGE cases where BAL's will be life-saving, but this windows is very short (128-192 blocks)For archive processing, BAL's will speed up things for just processing, but with decent hardware shouldn't be necessary

Sure, it’s our first time doing this, not perfect, but I think if we remove an EIP from headliner because it’s too small, that’s maybe fine, but we shouldn’t do it for “obvious” hedliners

ePBS is a specific (very good!) opinionated version of slot restructuring plus delayed execution. main benefit is significant scaling, more slot time available for propagation + execution.

01:12:36	terence:	here is my 2c:
- FOCIL is more on the CL then on the EL. FOCIL is fairly easy on the EL, just 2-3 engine api implementation.
- FOCIL shouldn't be a EL headliner rather than a CL headliner discussion
- Any EL headliner + FOCIL should be fine, but this is outside my domain
- The real debate is Epbs + FOCIL, but ACDC may be a better venue for this

01:12:47	thomasthiery:	Makes sense. Just feels like dropping FOCIL because it touches both layers (more CL than EL) and is not big enough to be a solo headliner, and too small to be a vanilla EIP is a bit trick.

Yeah no fork seems likely in April. That would basically imply we start forking in feb after having shipped a fork in nov.
01:15:49	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I would want Glamste..."

@Potuz I don't think that's true, e.g. just BALs plus repricing would be ready by then. if ePBS isn't, we should reconsider it

not a push system
01:16:45	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "ePBS = "Ethereum fai..."

The only thing erigon said about ePBS was that it doesn’t fit with the overall goals - this is false - ePBS is way better for scaling and minimizing overhead which allows you to minimize latency
01:16:50	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "I would want Glamste..."

I also think we’d get everyone putting all of their attention on these two only in Jan realistically. So assuming no one finds anything and we start shipping in feb seems unrealistic as well.

 Can we discuss 7903 as a replacement for 7907? It increases initcode only and doesn't touch state. It's not as ideal as 7907 but has some similar UX benefits since it allows you to deploy larger systems of contracts in one txn
