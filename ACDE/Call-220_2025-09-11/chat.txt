Most clients just doing nothing

Fair, I think we can re-evaluate then

00:33:19	saulius:	Replying to "i think 1 week is fi..."

well, client teams should try to make their clients work if non-finality happens on Holesky, but yea, likely we don't want to drop everything and focus on recovering it because of time/resources constrains.

00:37:39	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	So to summarize timelines?
22 Sep - RC client releases
Week of 29th - Holeski (1 week after client releases)
Week of 13th - Sepolia (2 weeks from Holeski)
Week of 27th - Hoodi (2 weeks from Sepolia)

00:59:14	Antonio Sanso:	Replying to "you can always have ..."

Not from any 🙂
00:59:29	potuz:	Replying to "you can always have ..."

yes, you just add the public key to the signature
00:59:31	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

so thats a whole thing that needs redesign - the ability to ecrecover from a sig does a lot of heavy lifting for us
00:59:45	Antonio Sanso:	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

Falcon has a key recovery mode
00:59:49	Danno Ferrin:	Replying to "you can always have ..."

Put the pubkey in the signature then it’s recoverable. I think that’s probably the best path forward on non-recoverable algorithms
01:00:24	Danno Ferrin:	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

NIST supported key recovery? They explicitly passed on it for falcon
01:01:42	Antonio Sanso:	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

However, as Renaud Dubois pointed out, Section 3.12 of the Falcon paper introduces a key recovery model.
01:02:11	Antonio Sanso:	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

Not NIST supported but in the falcon paper
01:02:16	potuz:	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

reposting in this thread cause it seems to repeat the above: any signature scheme has a recovery method: just append the pubkey to the signature
01:02:48	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "No PQ signatures hav..."

yes, this is my point, we just need to design for that in the sig abstraction mechanic. we should do that asap.
