00:17:42	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "If we want to scale ..."

It seems a short time improvement that would be irrelevant in the long term at the cost of breaking dApps
00:17:49	Toni Wahrstätter:	~ halve it is better and if you look at the cdf over gas used per txs, then this only affected very rare usecases, xen, batch ens registration, poisoning spam etc.

00:17:59	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "If we want to scale ..."

once we reprice, the specific per-tx limit is a bit arbitrary anyway, because we can basically either make the cheap operations 5x more expensive, or the expensive ones 5x cheaper
00:18:19	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "If we want to scale ..."

atomicity for one
00:22:00	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "is there any reason ..."

mev avoidance
00:22:06	Vitalik Buterin:	Is the primary argument about breaking dapps or about breaking offchain code that can be rewritten (but less conveniently)?

I think it's important to disaggregate the two
00:22:35	Vitalik Buterin:	I checked the tx in the magicians post ( 0xadc4e06a7a4c9442c14d1cf90c384d175e7e39f49f713924461c368253cb2697 ) and it's 19m gas for a contract deployment
00:23:15	Charles (vyper):	once we increase contract size limit, it will affect how large contract you can deploy :)
00:23:19	Charles (vyper):	140kb vs 70kb

00:24:39	Duncan Townsend (0x):	Another point I'm trying to make is that we don't know what we don't know about might break because we haven't had the time to solicit feedback and analyze
00:25:21	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "If we want to scale ..."

Yes but the point is at the current price make sure we don’t break anything. What happens after is fine, Dapps will adapt
00:25:42	Duncan Townsend (0x):	So I think a good, conservative approach would be to set the limit to 30M and then solicit feedback and analysis for setting the limit lower in the next hard fork
00:25:46	Marc:	it’s always easier to raise the limit in future than lower it, so going with 16M or maybe 20M makes sense to me
00:25:48	Josh Davis:	https://github.com/nerolation/EIPs/blob/17a90c395dd48099d5bcb740be1a76249cdad996/assets/eip-7825/analysis.md

00:28:54	Toni Wahrstätter:	I'm not sure if routes that take 16M gas are preferrable over the benefits of smaller transactions. It's a fair use case but should consume less gas.
00:29:01	Luis Pinto | Besu:	I like this idea, pay higher for pinning a CPU more than others. But ultimately would not prevent it though :/
00:29:35	CPerezz:	Replying to "Issue is full block ..."

Even if more expensive, they put a hard limit on the performance and specific worst case we have to cover. So scalability via gas_limit upgrades or ZKEVM proving suffer a lot wit it
00:29:57	Justin Florentine (Besu):	BALs utility goes down a bit
00:30:07	Tim Beiko:	@Toni Wahrstätter how hard is it to re-run your analysis with different limits?
00:30:17	Alexey:	Like you can send a tx containing 3 txs and can't execute it partially.  Still you can prepare witness for every one of 3, which enables parallelism
00:30:38	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "@Toni Wahrstätter ho..."

If easy, it could be good to see the impact of a cap at 2**24, 20M and 30M
00:30:57	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "BALs utility goes do..." 

 Yeah, execution parallelism would go down by almost 2x (in the worst case). Other benefits such as parallel state root or parallel IO are unaffected.
00:31:37	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "@Toni Wahrstätter ho..." 

 Not hard
00:31:53	Duncan Townsend (0x):	Replying to "Can be solved by fur..." 

 That would be a good solution, but quite complex
00:32:20	Danno Ferrin:	If we uncap the contract size then transaction gas limit becomes the new contract size limit.  24k is ~6 Million, so  16M gas would be in the neighborhood of 64k -72k contracts once code deposit is paid. So there is some pressure to not reduce it
00:33:55	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "BALs utility goes do..."

But I’m failing to get why it would have any impact? No ones is going to redeploy contracts to have txs up to 30M or 20M whatever we decide
00:34:04	Alexey:	Replying to "Can be solved by fur..."

Reminds of based rollups a bit btw
00:34:34	Vitalik Buterin:	One final argument: I also think doing these reductions is better earlier rather than later

So if we do 20m soon, then when we have to reorg limits again for the sake of multidim, we become able to do it mostly through increases rather than decreases

Doing this without formal releases will make it more difficult to rollout clients and get participation from node operators.

If client teams are comfortable releasing betas or something similar that's fine. Expecting node operators to build from source or other non-standard release path will likely limit participation.

Also wondering if it will be modified at all, e.g. will the blob deadline be moved up?
01:19:26	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "I think we should ha..."

Do you think it would have been better to focus this call on EPBS vs. DE @potuz @Francesco ?

Post based on empirical data about the free option problem coming soon (collab between us and FB)

01:21:47	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 There's two ways:
Decreased PTC deadline
Penalty for non reveal
01:22:21	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 The free option problem is a spectrum not a switch
01:22:37	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 We don't even know at this point how much of an issue it is
01:22:44	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

decreasing the PTC deadline is actively eating into the scaling benefits of ePBS, I would be stronly opposed to that
01:22:52	Barnabé Monnot:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

are we fine with penalising local builders now?
01:22:59	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 No it's not when we shorten slots
01:23:18	donnoh | L2BEAT:	might be early to discuss this but in the context of native rollups any change that current rollups make wrt L1 it makes more complicated to eventually switch to native
01:23:29	Sophia Gold:	Reacted to "might be early to ..." with 👍
01:23:49	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 Local builders can avoid this penalty even in the most unlucky circumstances by publishing the payload before the beacon block
01:24:48	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 Decreasing the PTC deadline is something we would already do when we shorten slots

 Why wouldnt i panalize a builder that commited to a payload and then didnt share it?

01:25:31	Francis:	Also want to call out that this is our preference and what we think would be most impactful, would be happy with what the community as a whole decides.
01:25:36	stokes:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

It could not be the builder’s fault
01:25:43	stokes:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

Could be network problems outside the builder
01:25:50	stokes:	I think hard to do this type of penalty in a robust way
01:25:52	potuz:	A TL;DR that I sent nixo
01:25:56	Barnabé Monnot:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

@ethDreamer (Mark) you wouldn’t decrease the deadline necessarily but it would have more overhead with respect to the slot time, hence the free option would not be as bad
01:26:03	potuz:	That's the ETHMAG thread today

@Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind you couldn’t tell whether it’s an external builder or a local one

01:26:16	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 Local builders can share the payload even earlier than others since they dont care about hiding content

 They also only build using public blobs so blob broadcast isn't an issue

01:27:45	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Besu is open to variants. We have a pr that implements EIP as written.
01:27:52	terence:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

local builder wont be penalized here though, they bid amount is just 0 here, this is checked in the state transition function
01:28:08	Barnabé Monnot:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

i don’t disagree with the arguments, we just had reached a different conclusion last time the question came up around missed slot penalties
01:28:23	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 Oh true, penalty can by a multiple of the bid amount
01:28:36	soispoke:	Reacted to "Local builders can s..." with 👍
01:28:50	Julian Ma:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

If you make penalty a multiple of the bid amount that would be an incentive not to use the in-protocol bid amount and use trusted relays
01:28:52	potuz:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

FWIW I agree with Alex and I am against slashing mechanisms... Assymetric payment is not a bad idea (a refund to the builder if the payload is processed) and easy to implement...
01:28:52	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 Better for penality to be a flat fee imo
01:28:58	Barnabé Monnot:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

@Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind that would give even more incentive to not reveal the true bid to the protocol
01:29:04	Justin Florentine (Besu):	provers want to know what was referenced
01:29:38	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..." 

 No need for multiple. Multiple scales with large bids but large bids already outpace the value of the option
01:29:45	Ansgar Dietrichs:	so I guess conclusion is “exact variant of BALs still tbd”?
01:29:47	potuz:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

More generally, I think the problem is much more constrained than what it is being made of, as I posted elsewhere, this only applies to single builder-searcher integrated, not any existing builder

01:30:42	Ansgar Dietrichs:	actually both ePBS and DE reduce the ratio of propagation to execution, so they would tighten the (relative) data constraints on BALs
01:30:52	Julian Ma:	Replying to "How does ePBS addres..."

Large bids correlate with periods of high volatility which is exactly when the option would be most valuable
01:31:00	Ben Adams:	Reacted to "so I guess conclusio..." with 👍
