00:15:50	Łukasz Rozmej:	So my comment: I don't expect many people joining that ACDG meetings because: already too many meetings, governance & politics is boring ect. So would this meeting mean there are decisions that are made there? Or it will just be proposals which will be brought later to other ACD calls? If that is the case it more "governance breakout room", and it is fine. Another question how often do you expect those meetings?
00:16:56	Anders Elowsson:	Replying to "So my comment: I don..."

It’s a big difference indeed if it is a decision-making body or just a forum for deeper discussion, that can make a recommendation, where the decision is then taken on a regular call for example.

00:21:32	Pooja Ranjan:	Replying to "So my comment: I don..."

So would this meeting mean there are decisions that are made there? 

In short, yes. ACD-G would define the process—for example, limiting an upgrade to five EIPs—while EIP selection and decision enforcement would remain within ACD.

Expected participants include EIP Editors and the EF Protocol Coordination / Protocol Support teams; however, interested client team representatives and other community participants are also welcome.
00:21:49	Marcin Sobczak:	We prepared an EIP for increasing price of point evaluation precompile: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-8096.mdPoint Evaluation is currently performing in all clients ~32MGas/s on reference machine which is a bottleneck for compute on protocol level.It is not included in general repricing eip, so we proposed brand new EIP-8096, potentially it can be unified with next iteration of general repricing eip.

@Anders Elowsson 
ACDG will serve as a discussion and decision-making forum, helping save time in ACD meetings by allowing those calls to focus on technical specifications. This ensures that governance questions are resolved early and technical meetings remain technical.

ACD-G aligns on governance and process, while ACD enforces and executes.
00:26:42	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "My prio list high to..."

Do we have an idea how to do 2926 without performance hit on clients?
00:26:43	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "My prio list high to..." 

 Yes definitely, I just don't see anyone doing the leg work for it yet (except maybe Carlos)

Usual circular dependency problem I guess, people won’t do the work until the thing is scheduled
00:27:40	felipe:	An early complexity assessment for the testing team for EIP-7907 puts this at a medium complexity, leaning on the higher end because of the account changes on the testing infra. The simpler approach would make this significantly lower.

00:33:29	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Yeah I also am think..."

Hard to say, it might be close, but it is not "cool", so I don't see it as a headliner for popularity reasons
00:33:40	Guillaume:	Replying to "Yeah I also am think..."

exactly
00:34:23	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Yeah I also am think..."

but my intuition is that unless cleverly done it will hit performance bad
00:34:32	jochem-brouwer:	Ansgar, for 7907 we have thus decided that we bump to 32 and not do the gas accounting? So like EIP-7654

For decision next week
00:34:43	lightclient:	i don’t think it actually removes the limit, just increases the limit to 2x the contract code size limit
00:34:55	Charles:	i've done the benchmarking for 7903, there are no jumpdest attacks
00:35:14	CPerezz:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."

I collected a bunch of data on different size contract reading.

For empty state data suggests linear increase and recommended hardware is fine. 

But I need to test this in bloat net and I will be able to provide perf and IO numbers for all sizes of contracts (up to 24 as nothing else is supported so far)
00:35:22	Charles:	Replying to "i don’t think it ..."

it was already 2x the contract size limit, it's either removing the limit entirely or bumping it
00:35:35	CPerezz:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."

I can try to have for next week the same data over 2.5x main net size and try to use this data to decide
00:36:43	EF Berlin office:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."

Okay and is it just spa moor PRs missing from your side?
00:36:59	CPerezz:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."

Yes. And then PRs in execution-specs
00:37:10	CPerezz:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."

I have PRs everywhere already, Just need the merges and run the tests then
00:37:18	CPerezz:	Replying to "Can we then align on..."
