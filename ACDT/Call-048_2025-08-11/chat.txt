00:21:10	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I do think getting to a combined ePBS + BALs (+ repricing) devnet would be very valuable
00:21:34	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "I do think getting t..."

basically the “scaling” devnet
00:21:49	Toni Wahrstätter:	BALs is already speced on top of fusaka
00:22:46	Justin Traglia:	FYI I’m planning to merge this PR soon: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4476
00:23:00	Mario Vega:	Replying to "I do think getting t..."

sorry what is it that we are repricing?
00:23:20	Louis:	Replying to "I do think getting t..."

Is it gas repricing?
00:23:33	Justin Traglia:	Sounds good 👍
00:23:57	Mario Vega:	Replying to "I do think getting t..."

Is there an EIP?
00:24:45	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "I do think getting t..." 

 Things like 7904, 7778, multi dim metering,
00:25:06	Alexey:	you mean we need meta eip?
00:25:33	Marius van der Wijden:	Can you quickly talk about the consensus issues found with fusaka @Mario Vega
00:26:58	Tim Beiko:	For repricings
00:27:02	Tim Beiko:	Like we had for EOF
00:27:13	Toni Wahrstätter:	I had this one too:
https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7981
00:29:04	Mario Vega:	Replying to "Can you quickly talk..."

For EIP-7823?
00:30:05	Louis:	Replying to "Can you quickly talk..."

Base & Modulus len is zero but exponent exceeds the upper bound

00:30:08	Justin Traglia:	Yeah this one ^

00:30:52	Parithosh Jayanthi:	@pk910 do you want to talk about 16M on eth_call?
00:31:21	spencer:	Replying to "Can you quickly talk…"
Test is merged!
00:31:28	Mario Vega:	Reacted to "Test is merged!" with 👍🏼
00:31:59	pk910:	uh, yea,  can quickly ask,  but I still don't know which client implemented it :D
so noone to blame yet

00:33:36	Ansgar Dietrichs:	seems better to keep eth_call unbounded, no?

00:34:12	Ben Adams:	Reacted to "seems better to keep..." with 💯
00:34:17	Ansgar Dietrichs:	sounds like just a bug then
00:34:26	Marius van der Wijden:	We have a configurable limit in geth iirc
00:34:35	lightclient:	Reacted to "We have a configurab..." with 👍
00:34:40	Ben Adams:	Well not unbounded, but high 🙂
00:35:54	Marius van der Wijden:	Defaulted to 50M in geth
00:36:04	pk910:	geth when used as lib sends a 50M gas limit by default.   we should keep this to maintain compatibility with existing tools :)
00:36:22	pk910:	Reacted to "Defaulted to 50M in ..." with 👍
00:37:40	Ansgar Dietrichs:	someone should just check with them whether that was really meant as a design decision
