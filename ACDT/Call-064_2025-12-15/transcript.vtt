1
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.309
Justin Traglia: Good morning, gentlemen.

2
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.239
Justin Traglia: You're leaving today's call, right, Barnabas?

3
00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.329
Barnabas: I really can't.

4
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.370
Justin Traglia: Cool, cool.

5
00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.430
Barnabas: Do you want to discuss the… The new ventilator type thing?

6
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.409
Justin Traglia: Yeah, I do. I just left a comment on the agenda.

7
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.240
Barnabas: Okay, yeah, I haven't seen it yet.

8
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.030
Barnabas: I think it would be good to discuss it, for sure.

9
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.459
Barnabas: Especially if you're gonna be merging it in now.

10
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.689
Justin Traglia: Yeah, and also the… and also the proposer preferences gossip topic thing I'd like to discuss.

11
00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:40.979
Justin Traglia: I just kind of want to get, like, a feeling for it, like, what do others think, and then maybe ask for reviews and merge it.

12
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.510
Justin Traglia: Just whenever.

13
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.570
Barnabas: Yeah, sounds good.

14
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.080
Barnabas: Groupon?

15
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.829
Barnabas: Let's give it another minute, then we can get started.

16
00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.519
Barnabas: Alright, let's get started. Welcome everybody to Allcore Dev's testing call, number 64.

17
00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.260
Barnabas: We have a spec agenda for today, so let's get started.

18
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:08.299
Barnabas: Regarding Fusaka, we had, last week BP01 going live, and it was a success, so congratulations to everybody participating in that.

19
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.159
Barnabas: And, is there any other open questions regarding Futaka?

20
00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:31.100
Barnabas: The only thing I can think of is, possibly BPO2, which is scheduled to go live on the 7th of January, which is, still, like, 3 weeks away from now.

21
00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:42.350
Barnabas: But other than that, I think, Fusakai is pretty much done. We're gonna have some BPO discussion later on the call, but, for now, I think we can move on to Glamsterdam.

22
00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.930
Barnabas: Okay.

23
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:57.769
Barnabas: Oh yeah, prison, had a post-mortem of, what happened in Fusaka during, like, right after the fort.

24
00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:04.910
Barnabas: James, could you maybe just put it in the chat, and then everybody can, take a look at the…

25
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.890
Barnabas: blog post.

26
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:09.859
Barnabas: Or, I don't know, do you guys want to talk about it?

27
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.870
Barnabas: Oh, I guess not. Okay.

28
00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.529
Barnabas: I think, I think we can move on to Glencer again. So…

29
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.950
Barnabas: Stefan, maybe you can give us an update for DevNet1 or DevNet 0 updates?

30
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:40.560
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, sure. So, we made some progress regarding the execution specters. There has been a release 2.0.

31
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:51.609
Stefan Starflinger: And, it would be great if clients did test against this new release. It came with a small spec change, where we use now the UNT256.

32
00:07:51.950 --> 00:08:05.809
Stefan Starflinger: for storage keys and values, so a lot of the tests will initially be failing. You can start testing against a BAL Definite 0 branch, but it would be great if all the client teams could switch to a biodefinite 1 branch.

33
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:14.689
Stefan Starflinger: There's, in particular, one test that some clients have been saying they're failing is the out-of-gas self-destruct test, so it'd be great if

34
00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.320
Stefan Starflinger: You could have a look. If you need any help with that, feel free to reach out.

35
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:25.270
Stefan Starflinger: And otherwise, it's just general stuff. I've also added it to the agenda.

36
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:31.059
Stefan Starflinger: Is Philippe here, maybe you would want to give an update also from the testing side?

37
00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:35.329
felipe: Yeah, sure. Other than…

38
00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:39.669
felipe: the UN256 changes, we added, quite a bit of…

39
00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:43.949
felipe: Gas boundary tests for call-up codes.

40
00:08:44.459 --> 00:08:46.719
felipe: So we should have more coverage there as well.

41
00:08:46.969 --> 00:08:48.789
felipe: But yeah.

42
00:08:49.069 --> 00:08:53.209
felipe: I think, everything else, went pretty smooth on the testing side.

43
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.090
Stefan Starflinger: Corvettes.

44
00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:07.079
Stefan Starflinger: Then yeah, it's… we have a breakout call, on Wednesday, I think, for Baos, and we can discuss anything in particular there.

45
00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:23.899
Stefan Starflinger: But otherwise, I think we're making good progress. I'd also like to remind people that it would be great to run kiosis tests with the EVM files, and just to make sure, leave it running for a while, just to make sure that the clients are working well in interop.

46
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:31.209
Stefan Starflinger: But otherwise, if clients might want to give a quick update where they're at right now, that would be great, or we could…

47
00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.740
Stefan Starflinger: do it on Wednesday as well.

48
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:35.330
Stefan Starflinger: more detailed.

49
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.260
Karim T. (matkt): I can on the business side, so,

50
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:50.100
Karim T. (matkt): Today, we implemented several features, we… we merged, state fruit conclusion…

51
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:53.099
Karim T. (matkt): traditional background, thanks to Block Access List.

52
00:09:53.390 --> 00:10:06.079
Karim T. (matkt): We are finishing the perfect parallelization with block access list. We just have to add some tests, but it's currently working, so I think we'll be able to merge the PR soon.

53
00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:16.880
Karim T. (matkt): We don't have yet batch reading using block accesses, but it will not be too hard to implement it, so I think we'll have it also as soon as possible.

54
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:23.279
Karim T. (matkt): We have some failing tests, some tests regarding the call operation.

55
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:31.990
Karim T. (matkt): So we know how to fix that, we just didn't start it to work on it, and we fixed also a self-district,

56
00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:43.430
Karim T. (matkt): issue, recently. So… Yeah, accepting that, we started the BaldurNet1 branch, we merged all of the different fixes.

57
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:50.590
Karim T. (matkt): And, we also updated the slot key and values format in this branch, so…

58
00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:53.780
Karim T. (matkt): Normally, it should be okay for the next run.

59
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.329
Barnabas: That's great. Is there any other ELs that could give us an update?

60
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.709
Barnabas: About their progress?

61
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:23.510
Marc: Yeah, for NetherMind, at the moment, I'm focused on the parallel transaction execution and, state route computation.

62
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:33.760
Marc: So, made some good progress on that, and I just need to, do a few updates related to this, new testing release.

63
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:53.899
draganrakita: From Redside, we made change to, storage, making from the… B256 to number.

64
00:11:54.010 --> 00:12:03.040
draganrakita: Started work on the… using BAL on the state route, and talking about BAR, how to do it parallel.

65
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.100
draganrakita: How to do parallel education.

66
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:14.230
draganrakita: I have run, 2.0 tests today, and had one bug to self-destruct, and…

67
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.759
draganrakita: out gas that I fixed.

68
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.140
Barnabas: Thank you. Anyone else?

69
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.609
Barnabas: Anyone maybe from gas could speak up?

70
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.259
Barnabas: Okay, is there any… yup.

71
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:53.189
milen | Erigon: Yeah, hey, I can give a quick one for, Aragon,

72
00:12:53.550 --> 00:13:04.489
milen | Erigon: We, just created the boudevNet branch and, joined the Hive tests. I think we have a bunch… a bunch of failure to go through.

73
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:08.450
milen | Erigon: And, yeah, we also have…

74
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:17.029
milen | Erigon: One other person working on, parallel execution, which also should be enabled by default on that branch.

75
00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:26.429
milen | Erigon: So yeah, I think we're just gonna go through the tests, through the remaining test failures next week, and yeah, that's about it.

76
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:37.329
Barnabas: Okay, thank you. Do we have any other ELs that would like to give us on that?

77
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:49.960
Barnabas: In case not, then I will just, pass the word to Justin. He has a few proposals for EPBS.

78
00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:52.739
Justin Traglia: Yep. Hello, everyone.

79
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:58.359
Justin Traglia: Yeah, so for EPBS, I guess the first thing we should talk about is probably,

80
00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:03.220
Justin Traglia: the change to builders that we want to make. So, like, we want to change

81
00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:09.820
Justin Traglia: builders so that they're not validating entities. This simplifies things quite a bit.

82
00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:16.450
Justin Traglia: Faster deposits, instant top- like, instant top-ups,

83
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.980
Justin Traglia: Lots of other simplifications, but essentially this moves…

84
00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:25.260
Justin Traglia: Builders from the validators list in the state to a new builders list.

85
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:30.679
Justin Traglia: Just asking client teams and everyone to review it, see if we all agree.

86
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:38.289
Justin Traglia: There's two different proposals for how we can do it. It seems that the second option is the most popular, so that's the one we'll probably go with.

87
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:41.050
Justin Traglia: It's just a term, like…

88
00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:53.540
Justin Traglia: Simplicity versus, like, lots of changes, yeah, regarding the pub key. Like, whether or not we should update the withdrawal structures to include a pub key, or just to reuse the validator index field.

89
00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:56.790
Justin Traglia: How do client teams feel about this?

90
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.780
Barnabas: Maybe someone from PRISM gonna comment on it?

91
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.160
Justin Traglia: That's a good question, Mario.

92
00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:30.659
Justin Traglia: I mean, there's multiple different ways we could bootstrap this, or sorry, there is a way we could bootstrap this, I'm not sure if it's a good idea, though, but we could have 0x03 validators before the fork, and then at the fork, they are converted to the new builder type.

93
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.219
Justin Traglia: That's one option.

94
00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:37.590
Justin Traglia: Or we just require builders wait one epoch before…

95
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:45.409
Justin Traglia: submitting bids so that they can create the builders. Like, it would be almost instant to create a new builder, and the minimum,

96
00:15:46.180 --> 00:15:46.879
Barnabas: It would be too.

97
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.540
Justin Traglia: The minimum stake amount would be 1 ETH as well. What is it, Barnabas?

98
00:15:50.690 --> 00:16:00.079
Barnabas: You mentioned, last week that it would be around 2 epochs to process a new builder, so if we have a fork transition, then we would basically go without

99
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.979
Barnabas: Without builders for 3 epochs, right?

100
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.200
Justin Traglia: Something like that, yeah.

101
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.920
Justin Traglia: Unless we do the bootstrapping, idea. And I think POTUS is in favor of that. It's just…

102
00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:14.779
Justin Traglia: I'm personally not. I think it's kind of complicated.

103
00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:25.599
Barnabas: I mean… we had 0x02 editors also going online before the fork of Spectra.

104
00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:26.510
Barnabas: So why would…

105
00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:26.990
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

106
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:28.200
Barnabas: Why would this be a problem?

107
00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.480
Justin Traglia: So there's a property I want to maintain that…

108
00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.089
Justin Traglia: There can't be a validator and a builder with the same pub key in the state.

109
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.619
Justin Traglia: Just for simplicity, that way you can, like.

110
00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:47.650
Justin Traglia: Know that if you're given some pup key, you can look it up in one or the other, and know that they don't exist in both.

111
00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:51.800
Justin Traglia: If we do the conversion, you would essentially have

112
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:57.339
Justin Traglia: Sorry, you would have a pub key in both, and I just don't like that.

113
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.530
Justin Traglia: Does that make sense?

114
00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.190
Barnabas: Yep, it does.

115
00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:09.340
Barnabas: Is there a breakout this Friday?

116
00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:12.329
Justin Traglia: There is indeed. I can share a link just in just a second.

117
00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:20.329
Barnabas: So, it would be very, very, very good if you could make a final decision on this by, this week's breakout.

118
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:23.779
Barnabas: And, I can go off to the holidays with,

119
00:17:24.109 --> 00:17:34.079
Barnabas: the firm decision. I didn't really make the decision even before that, but I saw that, for example, Lighthouse didn't have time to take a closer look yet, so…

120
00:17:34.759 --> 00:17:38.549
Barnabas: I would like to have a deadline on that for the breakout room.

121
00:17:38.989 --> 00:17:39.939
Justin Traglia: Agreed.

122
00:17:39.939 --> 00:17:40.859
Barnabas: Enrico?

123
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:47.449
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Just a very quick question. I was not looking into the details, but one question I had…

124
00:17:48.020 --> 00:18:01.029
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): In my mind is, if we go in that direction, does it mean that, like, any normal validator that wants to submit bids of the network are actually cut off?

125
00:18:01.790 --> 00:18:04.780
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, you… you won't be validating.

126
00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:07.969
Justin Traglia: They would be cut off, yeah.

127
00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:18.310
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, like, a thing that, like, Potos is saying, always saying that, my node running at home will always submit beats, that, that's not true anymore.

128
00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.789
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, you have to have a different…

129
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:21.520
Justin Traglia: Correct.

130
00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.280
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Okay.

131
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.120
Justin Traglia: I mean, you would just have to have, like, a…

132
00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:27.509
Justin Traglia: Another note at home with one ETH.

133
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:34.299
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And, well, depends by where we land in terms of capital, minimal capital.

134
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:41.000
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Just to enable building, so if we go with higher… If required.

135
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:42.000
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

136
00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.310
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Then this would become capital inefficient.

137
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.879
Justin Traglia: Agreed. Yeah, we can discuss that more later, but currently it's, 1 ETH is the minimum.

138
00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:00.000
Justin Traglia: But you're right, it does break that,

139
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:03.140
Justin Traglia: That was nice that any validator could submit a bid.

140
00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.520
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yep.

141
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.510
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I was personally… personal liking it.

142
00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:21.069
Justin Traglia: Any other top… sorry, any other, Points on the builder's change.

143
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:32.979
Justin Traglia: Okay, there's a different topic I'd like to discuss then, too.

144
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:40.279
Justin Traglia: the proposer preferences gossip topic suggestion that I, am wanting to make.

145
00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:54.189
Justin Traglia: Essentially, we need a way to convey to builders the fee recipient and gas limit, and whether or not they accept trusted payments. And I think the best way to do that is via a new gossip topic.

146
00:19:55.100 --> 00:20:00.909
Justin Traglia: What is it now? The epoch before the…

147
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.390
Justin Traglia: Proposal. Proposers would submit their preferences to the topic.

148
00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.859
Justin Traglia: So yeah, just… 32 proposer preferences per epoch.

149
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:17.270
Justin Traglia: So it's a pretty minimal, topic without, like, a lot of traffic.

150
00:20:17.850 --> 00:20:23.240
Justin Traglia: Have clients had time to review this one? Or… Do people have ideas?

151
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.520
Justin Traglia: Thoughts?

152
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:34.069
Bharath: I have one thought, like, so, I think recently, you added a field,

153
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.690
Bharath: To… to signal that the proposal will accept a trusted payment.

154
00:20:39.010 --> 00:20:42.849
Bharath: I'm unsure if that should be on the gossip topic, because

155
00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.869
Bharath: I would assume, like, the proposer would, what is that?

156
00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:52.960
Bharath: you have a set of builders you trust, right? Because there's a risk here, like, the builder could say, I…

157
00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.289
Bharath: could signal an execution payment with the bid, but can choose to, like, not do it, and there's no easy way to verify that, so…

158
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:05.929
Bharath: I would assume the proposer would want to, like, be like, okay, I trust Builder A, B, C, but I don't trust D.

159
00:21:06.090 --> 00:21:10.890
Bharath: So, I would assume this should be more granular, is my take.

160
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:14.130
Justin Traglia: Possibly, yeah.

161
00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:25.999
Bharath: Yeah, so… yeah, that's where, like, I am just evaluating, like, maybe validated registrations might be the place, because there you could kind of, like, be more granular in, sending per-builder preferences.

162
00:21:26.370 --> 00:21:32.390
Justin Traglia: validator registrations with… with who? Like, the trusted builders out of protocol builders, whatever they're called?

163
00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.050
Bharath: Yeah, no, no, I mean, like, you anyways have the URLs of the…

164
00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:56.259
Bharath: So, like, to… let's say that you have a builder API, you anyways are going to have the URLs of the builders in one way or the other. You either have your own whitelist, or you fetch it from somewhere. You kind of know, okay, this is the builder, this is… this builder A, this is builder B, and through that, you're able to, like, okay, I don't trust this builder, I don't trust that builder, or I trust this builder.

165
00:21:56.540 --> 00:21:59.610
Bharath: So, that's, like, in an initial thought right now, then.

166
00:22:00.490 --> 00:22:09.399
Justin Traglia: I'm confused how the registrations part works. Do you send your registration to each individual builder, like, in Epoch before the proposal, or how would that work?

167
00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:17.229
Bharath: Yeah, that's the idea. I mean, like… like, today, I think, on an epoch boundary, we send the registrations, so I would assume, like.

168
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:24.780
Bharath: This definitely has to be more thought out, and, like, I'm working on, like, writing more down here, but the initial thought is, like.

169
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:30.949
Bharath: On the epoch boundaries, when, you're sending a validated registrations, you… you take a design… you take a call, okay, like.

170
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:35.179
Bharath: I know I'm gonna send to this builder, I probably, like.

171
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.479
Bharath: I want to accept, like, a trusted payment from them, or not.

172
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.580
Bharath: But yeah, that's just the high thought, like…

173
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.350
Justin Traglia: Okay. Yeah, I mean, I don't have to think about it more, I don't know.

174
00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.960
Bharath: Yeah, we can, like, take it out on the channel, like, yeah.

175
00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.010
Justin Traglia: Cora.

176
00:22:50.260 --> 00:23:05.609
Justin Traglia: I don't like the current way validator registrations work with relays, like, where each validator sends a registration regardless of whether or not they're proposing. It's kind of messy and inefficient, so… I feel that this gossip topic solves a big problem.

177
00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:20.240
Bharath: It does, it does, like… I think it's just, like, the question is, like, do we want, like, per builder preferences? The gossip topic is great for, like, communicating, like, a global preference with, like, the fee recipient and gas limit, that totally makes sense, but…

178
00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:26.609
Bharath: Like, maybe once you want, like, a per-builder, like, preference, like, I don't know, I'm just, like, putting it out, like, like, something like,

179
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:39.270
Bharath: like, min-bit doesn't make sense, but I don't know, I can't get anything in my head right now, but some up top, some, like, you know, per builder, like, preference, like, if you want. I don't know if the gossip topic is the best way to communicate it.

180
00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.960
Bharath: Because that's on a global… But yeah.

181
00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.849
Justin Traglia: Okay, yeah, we can discuss that more.

182
00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.260
Bharath: Yeah, yeah, no, but off-cost, sure.

183
00:23:49.260 --> 00:24:03.200
Justin Traglia: Offline. Palan, yes, but I just added a, accept… sorry, Trusted Payments Accepted field, because, we were discussing it in the EPBS channel on the Ether R&D Discord.

184
00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:08.730
Justin Traglia: It's just a Boolean. If people don't like that, I can remove it.

185
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.690
Justin Traglia: Yep.

186
00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.170
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

187
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:21.959
Justin Traglia: And, I guess that's it for me for EPBS.

188
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.260
Justin Traglia: Maybe just more client updates or something.

189
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:31.259
Bharath: I can give, like, a small update, like, I've been working on, like, just, like, starting to spec out the builder specs.

190
00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:34.670
Bharath: thinking about, like, our documents, we've been thinking about,

191
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:47.529
Bharath: how the builder API will look for staked and unstaked builders. Unstaked builders probably, with the 1 ETH, like, change, like, where we reduce the stake to 1 ETH, I… I'm pretty doubtful we… we will have unstaked builders.

192
00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:52.590
Bharath: We could, like, push builders to stake with one ETH, that should be fine, and do, like.

193
00:24:52.790 --> 00:24:55.570
Bharath: A trusted payment on, this thing, like…

194
00:24:55.830 --> 00:25:00.910
Bharath: So, so yeah, outside that, I've just been working on the builder specs, like, trying to, like.

195
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:10.839
Bharath: And it's an initial iteration. This will definitely, like, go through, like, a lot of, like, changes, a lot of iterations up once things are, like, more clear and more,

196
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:16.919
Bharath: What's that? More, like, concrete. So, yeah, that's one update I have, like, just, like, starting to work on that.

197
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:25.540
Bharath: 4788, you mean… Like, the EIP47AA?

198
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.299
Barnabas: No, no, no, I meant, Justin's… yeah.

199
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:32.269
Barnabas: Yeah, the option too.

200
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.850
Bharath: Sorry, I couldn't, like…

201
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:42.400
Barnabas: So that's… that's the PR that Justin has been talking about, just previously.

202
00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:49.700
Bharath: Oh, yeah, yeah, no, so I still have to look at that PR and, like, make, like, changes according to that, if it does impact.

203
00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:52.440
Barnabas: Okay, hold on.

204
00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:59.599
Barnabas: Yeah, and Justin has, two more, PRs that he would like to merge in today.

205
00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:01.070
Barnabas: Please.

206
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:07.670
Barnabas: Go through them and review it, and approve if you're happy, or raise any questions if you're not.

207
00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:13.240
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other EPBS, discussion topic?

208
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:28.800
Barnabas: In Kesnau, do we have anyone regarding, gas limit increase discussion.

209
00:26:31.570 --> 00:26:32.500
Barnabas: Got done.

210
00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:44.329
Ben Adams: Let's go! Sorry, assuming… I think it's, depending on, how we feel about the BPOs.

211
00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:49.499
Ben Adams: As I understand it, that's all looking good.

212
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:55.460
Ben Adams: We're not, like, stressing, the, the validation's out?

213
00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:02.510
Ben Adams: Because, obviously, we have BPO2 to come, so… Right.

214
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:14.820
Barnabas: The VPR2 would have a few requirements on the CL side. It would probably want to have the max blobs on the ER side and partial responses on the CL side.

215
00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:18.409
Barnabas: Which might require a few more weeks of work.

216
00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:27.600
Ben Adams: Yeah, I just mean in terms of… because it's lower… lower bandwidth than the, 3 free sockers.

217
00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:30.440
Barnabas: Joe.

218
00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:52.599
Kamil Chodoła: So, from testing point of view, we are improving test generation right now, as we have some missing tests, so… yeah, and we have already PR ready to merge everything and retest once more.

219
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.249
Kamil Chodoła: So, we need to have that as a precondition, that's first thing. And other than that,

220
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:03.690
Kamil Chodoła: We are working in Netherlands right now on some improvements around State DB.

221
00:28:04.030 --> 00:28:09.930
Kamil Chodoła: but also would wait for BPOs first to see how it would go, and in the meantime, discuss it further.

222
00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:15.520
Kamil Chodoła: But other than that, I don't see any reasons to limit ourselves.

223
00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:21.319
Kamil Chodoła: So, I mean, 75 or 80, whatever we want to pick, should be doable.

224
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.340
Kamil Chodoła: Quite soon.

225
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:26.310
Kamil Chodoła: But you need to have these tests restarted once more.

226
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:42.329
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, if there's a concrete definition for the gas limit and potentially a date, I would really appreciate that, because it would help us focus the analysis a lot more.

227
00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:53.309
Kamil Chodoła: So, running tests, we'll have it this week, everything restarted, refreshed to the latest spec.

228
00:28:53.670 --> 00:29:03.279
Kamil Chodoła: And then we'll know if there are any other bottlenecks which were introduced, or any new tests which are uncovering some… some worrisome scenarios.

229
00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:10.459
Kamil Chodoła: And yes, and after that, I will make a summary, and will maybe suggest some… something for it.

230
00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:15.720
Barnabas: Perfect, thank you.

231
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.410
Barnabas: Is there anything else?

232
00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:21.970
Barnabas: Regarding interest in the gas limit further?

233
00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:30.629
Ameziane Hamlat: I have a quick question. How do we want to handle the next increase in gas limit? Because if…

234
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:35.880
Ameziane Hamlat: We have to do it before, like, Lamsterdam, this means that…

235
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.400
Ameziane Hamlat: Either we change the defaults.

236
00:29:39.950 --> 00:29:46.689
Barnabas: That would be the idea, to change the defaults for the next BPO, ideally.

237
00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.850
Ameziane Hamlat: I see, okay, that's the… okay.

238
00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:51.160
Ameziane Hamlat: That makes sense.

239
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:55.090
Ben Adams: I'm remembering… Also, you know, signal.

240
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.860
Ben Adams: Socially.

241
00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.960
Ben Adams: The validators can choose if they want to.

242
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:02.030
Ben Adams: Go further.

243
00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:06.750
Ben Adams: I mean, not go further. Raise, raise their own setting.

244
00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:18.070
Barnabas: I mean, validators can do whatever they want right now, so, yeah, that's a different topic. I think that's very dangerous. Probably we should stop doing that.

245
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:21.719
Barnabas: But, that's a discussion for another day, I think.

246
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.000
Ben Adams: What do you mean? Socially signalling that… We think it's okay.

247
00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:43.129
Barnabas: Yeah, like, same way as with the BPOs, the target and max are configured by the client, and it's not overwrittenable by a runtime flag. So I think we should be doing the same, for the guest limit as well.

248
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.139
Ben Adams: Oh, okay.

249
00:30:45.580 --> 00:30:48.360
Ben Adams: Okay, that's a discussion for a different day.

250
00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.120
Barnabas: Yeah, exactly.

251
00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:57.409
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other…

252
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:00.639
Barnabas: Topics to discuss regarding the guesstimate increase?

253
00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:08.109
Kamil Chodoła: I mean, it's kind of related, but in the meantime, we are working heavily towards the repricings.

254
00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.029
Kamil Chodoła: And then some analysis.

255
00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:18.030
Kamil Chodoła: We have already quite a lot of tests, like a sample test for each opcode.

256
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:26.450
Kamil Chodoła: a set of 160 tests with worst cases for each specific opcode, and right now Lewis is working on adding precompiles on top of that.

257
00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:27.950
Kamil Chodoła: And…

258
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:43.959
Kamil Chodoła: hopefully today, or tomorrow, we'll gather some first data for Maria and her team to analyze the data and start suggesting some better numbers, because the current ones from 7904, which were suggested quite a long time ago.

259
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:57.140
Kamil Chodoła: are, I would say, completely irrelevant comparing to the client's performance, and it would introduce plenty of new bottlenecks and making spread much worse. So, we need to figure out the better numbers for it, surely.

260
00:31:57.350 --> 00:32:00.629
Kamil Chodoła: And hopefully, we will have that by the end of December.

261
00:32:03.630 --> 00:32:04.319
Barnabas: That's good.

262
00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.090
Barnabas: Yep. So I think there's also a breakout room.

263
00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:17.170
Barnabas: Where we can dive in deeper for the repricing.

264
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:24.920
Barnabas: Numbers, and yeah, just follow up in… offline, maybe, if you have a good suggestion coming.

265
00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:32.770
Maria Silva: Sorry, I would add, I don't think there's a breakout room at the moment. We did, like, a one-time

266
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:40.569
Maria Silva: Thing, but if you guys think it's useful, we can restart it in a more, like, weekly basis or bi-weekly basis.

267
00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:43.469
Maria Silva: If you feel that's helpful.

268
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:55.050
Barnabas: Oh, I… Yeah, maybe I, missed that. I thought that we had, breakouts for this.

269
00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:00.390
Barnabas: I'm not sure if… if you need one. Maybe you can discuss that offline?

270
00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:03.400
Maria Silva: Sounds good, sounds good.

271
00:33:06.760 --> 00:33:08.160
Barnabas: Okay,

272
00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:19.780
Barnabas: a few more follow-up topics regarding, possibly scheduling BP03. As I mentioned earlier, we would probably want to have the partial responses,

273
00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:23.099
Barnabas: working before we activate BPOS3.

274
00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:32.689
Barnabas: We should have a working prison and lighthouse branch right now, with, gas and nitrominees supporting Get Block Space 3.

275
00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:48.220
Barnabas: hopefully we can have all ELs, push out a branch, at least, for GetLabs V3, and all other CLs also to, support the posture responses. And then we can start doing an interrupt testing, and,

276
00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:52.409
Barnabas: Try to figure out what the next bottleneck is going to be.

277
00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.629
Barnabas: Raul, maybe you have something else to add?

278
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:20.480
Raúl Kripalani: No, I think you… you summarized it pretty well. I think some ELs already had, PRs that they had submitted when we had this original discussion and Fusaka time, so it should be a matter of rehashing those PRs and… and refreshing them if Master has changed. So pretty… pretty straightforward. It's a backwards compatible change.

279
00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.930
Raúl Kripalani: It would help if ELs would…

280
00:34:23.929 --> 00:34:42.179
Raúl Kripalani: include, if they feel comfortable to do that, if they would include this change in their next release, whether a minor, patch, or whatever, because, it would help integration, like, it would help us integrate better in DevNets, going forward, so that we have to maintain fewer, fewer branches.

281
00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:56.389
Raúl Kripalani: And yeah, we'll keep this group updated on what the numbers are and how things are looking as we continue the efforts. There is some open points in the spec that we are trying to

282
00:34:56.389 --> 00:35:02.980
Raúl Kripalani: resolve, or at least get directionally resolved by the end of this week, so that, when we resume this work.

283
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:18.459
Raúl Kripalani: after, kind of, like, the stopping period finishes, we'll kind of, like, come back to a solid spec. So, yeah, if people can… we'll send a link, and if people can start having a look, like, most… there's already a working… there's already a working group. Most people…

284
00:35:18.510 --> 00:35:20.360
Raúl Kripalani: Like, the different…

285
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:36.070
Raúl Kripalani: Devs that are network inclined from ELs and CLs have already been added, and we're meeting on a weekly basis. If you would like to participate in this call, just reach out, and I'll add you as well, and this is what we'll be sharing the spec. So yeah, that's pretty much it.

286
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:47.239
Barnabas: Thank you. Yeah, and one more follow-up on, possibly including this in the next, releases. I, I would like to…

287
00:35:47.270 --> 00:36:01.440
Barnabas: Reach out to all the ES to implement the max blobs flag, which will limit local block builders to be able to limit how many blobs they would like to include in a specific block, making sure that they will not produce an orphan block.

288
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:05.629
Barnabas: I know that Netherland and REST has already implemented it, but,

289
00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:14.909
Barnabas: I would like just to have this included in the next releases of every year, hopefully in the next, month or two.

290
00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:23.069
Barnabas: And I saw Ben raise your hand for a little bit. Do you have something to add?

291
00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:34.940
Ben Adams: Yeah, it was just back on the topic of raising the gas limit, but also with shorter slots, and your controversial

292
00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:39.500
Ben Adams: Take on that it should be… Set.

293
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:45.680
Ben Adams: By the, by the values in the clients, rather than…

294
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:58.660
Ben Adams: by… by the validators. If we did do that, then the issue with shorter slots would be easily resolved, whereas at the moment, there's a… there's an argument over

295
00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:01.129
Ben Adams: How we interpret the value.

296
00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:06.279
Ben Adams: So, maybe, maybe we could put that…

297
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.650
Ben Adams: And there's something for the shortest slot.

298
00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:12.299
Barnabas: How do we interpret which value?

299
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:19.330
Ben Adams: Like, if a validator set the gas limit, it becomes ambiguous what we want to do when.

300
00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:21.990
Barnabas: It would be a no-op, that's my proposal.

301
00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:22.990
Ben Adams: Yeah, yeah.

302
00:37:24.930 --> 00:37:29.319
Ben Adams: But it solves the issue with shorter slots, and what do we do with the gas limit.

303
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:31.210
Barnabas: Yeah.

304
00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:42.669
Barnabas: Yeah, I think this may be a topic that we could discuss early next year.

305
00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.549
Barnabas: If you actually want to do this or not,

306
00:37:46.590 --> 00:37:50.389
Barnabas: Yeah, I'm not sure if today is the right call for that.

307
00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:54.740
Barnabas: Okay,

308
00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:04.149
Barnabas: There's one more, topic, the RPC testing from Tulio, from Aragon. He has a quick presentation for us.

309
00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:10.059
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Yes, hi everyone. May I share my screen?

310
00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:22.359
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Okay, can you see the slides?

311
00:38:22.540 --> 00:38:23.840
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Hope so.

312
00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.570
Barnabas: Yes, we can.

313
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:40.450
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Okay, thank you. Okay, I'm Tulio from Aragon, nicknamed Kanipat on Discord, and I'll be talking about RPC testing in the context of the rising standardization efforts of the LRPC protocol.

314
00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:53.340
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: The current status of the RPC protocol is well known. We have many differences among the various client implementations at multiple levels.

315
00:38:53.450 --> 00:39:04.669
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: at namespace level, endpoint level, input-output levels, and above all, in semantics, especially for non-trivial API endpoints.

316
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:09.059
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Of course, such fragmentation,

317
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:29.139
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: is the result of lacking standardization, but fortunately, there are some efforts already ongoing, which hopefully will produce a proper standardization process, and as Aragon, we are really keen to join such effort. I've been told that there is this RPC standard call, and I'm planning to join it in the future.

318
00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:40.859
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And in our view, three areas are fundamental. The specs, it's important to come up with a full spec, both in human-readable and machine-readable formats.

319
00:39:41.320 --> 00:40:00.559
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: A proper version scheme is required, and it's particularly relevant to improve application layer developer experience. Last but not least, the largest possible non-regression test suite, and this is where I'm going to focus right now in the following slides.

320
00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:12.289
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: In our opinion, testing for compatibility at the RPC layer, when full standardization is in place, will need more than one single tool.

321
00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:20.980
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Currently, there is IVRPC Compact test suite, and just to be extremely clear, we love it, we really love it.

322
00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:26.710
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: It's just that, as always happens, it has strengths and weaknesses.

323
00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:32.509
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: So, we have developed a complementary, let's say, RPC testing suite, which…

324
00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:44.579
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: with its own strengths and weaknesses, which we call RPC integration tests, and we use both of them in our CI, as you can see from the picture.

325
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:52.220
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: We use them for non-regression testing, not only in Aragon main branch and release branches.

326
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.489
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: but also as gates in HPR.

327
00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.180
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: But why should we use two different tools?

328
00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.200
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Well, because…

329
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:14.499
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Both such tools inherently come down to some trade-offs when it comes to checking RPC compatibility. On one hand, Hive RPC Compact uses a small simulated chain.

330
00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:15.880
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: contains…

331
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:27.840
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: about 200 tests, and adding new test cases may be hard in some situations. As an example, in case of a complex interaction among different contracts.

332
00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:40.539
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: On the other hand, Hive automatically handles the provisioning of all clients in its chain, and it's quite lightweight in terms of resource requirement, which is good, of course.

333
00:41:41.070 --> 00:41:51.489
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: So, in my opinion, it's very good for a priori testing, let's say, which means for testing well-defined cases that you can identify up front.

334
00:41:51.660 --> 00:41:55.759
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: I mean, for example, when developing a new API implementation.

335
00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:04.590
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: As opposed to this RPC, Integration tests instead work with real data from real chains.

336
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:11.050
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Our collection contains more… oh, sorry, contains more than,

337
00:42:12.610 --> 00:42:22.680
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Contains more than 1,300 tests, and adding new test cases is

338
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:27.449
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: is really as simple as adding a new JSON file.

339
00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.749
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: With request and response pair. Of course, in this case.

340
00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:47.120
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Client provisioning is completely left to the user, because we use, real nodes, in sync with, real… attached to, mainnet or real testnets.

341
00:42:47.450 --> 00:42:48.300
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And…

342
00:42:48.490 --> 00:43:05.129
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: So, in some sense, the testing setup is heavy. Not the framework itself, the framework is lightweight, but I think you've got what I want to say, and the real test setup is… is heavy.

343
00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:19.389
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: This tool really shines, in my opinion, in a posteriority testing, which means if you have an issue coming directly from mainnet or some testnet, you can simply add a new

344
00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:31.550
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: JSON file to start testing, and come up with a non-regression test that will run on your CI at the end of the bug session, and this is very useful.

345
00:43:32.820 --> 00:43:44.580
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Okay, so let's take a look at the testing modes that we have in our RPC integration test. We have two different modes, historical tests and latest tests.

346
00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:51.449
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Historical tests are tests executed at some old block or old state.

347
00:43:51.700 --> 00:44:00.490
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Key features, okay, we support both HTTP and WebSocket Transport Protocol, also with optional compression.

348
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:06.120
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And we basically use JSON response files containing

349
00:44:06.320 --> 00:44:09.129
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: The request, and the expected response.

350
00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:14.590
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Historical tests typically work, for an archive node.

351
00:44:14.830 --> 00:44:24.100
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: even in degraded mode, let's say. Here, with degraded, I mean, synced up to the max block contained in the test suite.

352
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:27.810
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: But not more, so you don't need to have it cinched up.

353
00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:32.699
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: to the tip, necessarily. You can, but it's not strictly required.

354
00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:38.959
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Then we have, latest tests, which are tests done at the chain head.

355
00:44:40.930 --> 00:44:51.449
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: We cannot compare the response with a predefined result in this case, so we use a reference system, which means we run another client implementation.

356
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:57.340
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Issue the same request to both the system under test, which is arrogant for us.

357
00:44:57.470 --> 00:45:03.139
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And to the reference system, then we compare the responses and the test passes if they are the same.

358
00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:08.209
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: This setup works also for a full node.

359
00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.330
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Or even for an aggressively pruned node.

360
00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:25.050
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: As a last note, I would like to add that RPC tests also contain a tool for performance testing.

361
00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:30.759
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: I suppose that currently, Each client team has its own way of doing this.

362
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:37.130
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: But there are so many challenges in performance testing,

363
00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:44.569
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: That's… we think it would be good to share the burden and team up on this subject.

364
00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:52.690
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Main challenges are, of course, various node… handle various node configuration to test, different platforms.

365
00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:59.919
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: different hardware and OSes, a huge number of test vectors that you can choose from, You… you need to…

366
00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:15.199
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: probably save a results history if you want to experiment with fancy things, like automatic corrugation detection, which is something we are trying to do. It's still in progress, because it's not trivial.

367
00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:22.450
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And yeah, in the end, we run also performance tests, as well in our CI.

368
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:25.540
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Nightly or on demand.

369
00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:36.079
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Okay, that's basically it. Once again, this is the public repository for our RPC testing suite.

370
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:46.070
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: the current version is, that we use on our CI is written in Python. It all started as a couple pall of dirty Python scripts.

371
00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:52.119
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Now we are doing a complete rewriting goal to have better control over the underlying tools.

372
00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:57.860
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: that we use. For example, for performance testing, we rely on the data.

373
00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:05.140
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And we believe that all clients can benefit from using it alongside hybrid PC compacts.

374
00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:06.450
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: As we do.

375
00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:10.509
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Or maybe, I don't know, using a modified version?

376
00:47:10.830 --> 00:47:20.310
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: I mean, any way this community ends up using it, that's totally welcome, and we are happy to share it.

377
00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:26.479
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And to collaborate in standardizing the RPC also in the testing.

378
00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:31.920
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: And, yeah, I think that's it, and… Thank you very much.

379
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.080
Barnabas: Thank you, Tulio.

380
00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:41.660
Barnabas: Yeah, I think it would be very good for you to present this also, possibly in the

381
00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:52.459
Barnabas: in the RPC standardization call. I'm not sure when the next one is for that one. Maybe next week, Monday, actually, at 3 p.m. UTC.

382
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.680
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: next Monday.

383
00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:57.400
Barnabas: Yep. Okay, yep.

384
00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:58.460
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:04.279
Barnabas: pre-systemization calls, so I'm not sure if they have it scheduled for that as well.

386
00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:05.790
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: I'll do it.

387
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:10.350
Barnabas: That would be the… yeah, that would be the proper place to present this, I think, yeah.

388
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:12.849
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Okay, okay. Thank you.

389
00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:18.180
Barnabas: Thank you. Anyway, does anyone have a question, or…

390
00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:33.369
Chase Wright: Actually, I was just wondering, Tulio, can you hit me up on Discord? I'm Mystic Ryujin. I'm working on documenting a lot of this stuff on the EF side, so I'd like to work with you on this.

391
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:35.720
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Sure, I will ping you.

392
00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.360
Chase Wright: Thank you.

393
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:52.460
Barnabas: Okay, so the next topic is, HTAR discussion topics,

394
00:48:52.730 --> 00:49:05.279
Barnabas: There was a bit of confusion last week, raised by this comment on Eat Magicians, where we decided star name that we picked, HECA is not an actual star name.

395
00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:10.939
Barnabas: So, Leo proposed that, Beginning to,

396
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:29.320
Barnabas: we're gonna rename Heko to Heze, or Hizzy, or… I still don't really know how to… how to pronounce the start name, but seems like we have actually got more votes on this alternative name than the original name, so I would just say that we move on with the…

397
00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:33.379
Barnabas: new, H star name of Heather.

398
00:49:33.510 --> 00:49:34.340
Barnabas: Oh.

399
00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.840
Barnabas: Easy.

400
00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.480
Barnabas: Does anyone know how to actually… pronounce it?

401
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:57.219
Barnabas: Yeah, and then maybe for the final sorting, we can make the decision on this Thursday call, so that this topic is,

402
00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:59.390
Barnabas: Over, once and for all.

403
00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.640
Barnabas: And then we can start working on the next, story.

404
00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:09.489
Barnabas: Anyone has an opinion on this?

405
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:22.089
Barnabas: Oh, yeah, that would be very good to know the actual pronunciation of the star.

406
00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.630
Barnabas: uncertain.

407
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:36.689
Barnabas: Okay, then… The next topic would be the holiday schedule for ACDs.

408
00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:42.049
Barnabas: I'm going to be posting a…

409
00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:53.950
Barnabas: proposal in the chat. So, this week's Thursday, there's gonna be an ACDE, and the 22nd of December, there might be a ACDT. It depends on whether

410
00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:55.770
Barnabas: Redeem it necessary?

411
00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:14.780
Barnabas: 25th of December, ACDC would be canceled. 29th of December, ACDT would be canceled. 1st of January, the ACDE would be canceled. On the 5th of January, ACDT would become a ACDE. And on the 8th of January, it would be an ACDC.

412
00:51:16.350 --> 00:51:22.010
Barnabas: Would everyone be happy with this schedule?

413
00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:34.349
Barnabas: My main question would be the 22nd of December, which is next week, Monday. Do we actually need another ECDT for this year, or could this call be the last,

414
00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.220
Barnabas: SCDT of the year.

415
00:51:50.970 --> 00:51:58.290
Barnabas: If nobody's gonna raise anything, then, I think we're gonna be also canceling the ACDT next week, Monday.

416
00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.820
Barnabas: our… yeah, James… James wants to…

417
00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.890
Barnabas: Jim's on to the CDP, so… Go for next week?

418
00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:08.780
Barnabas: Nope.

419
00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:18.340
Barnabas: So I guess we're gonna try to schedule one more call for next week, Monday, and that's gonna be… oh, you don't want it.

420
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:29.769
Barnabas: Does anyone want a call next Monday?

421
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:40.470
Barnabas: Yeah, it doesn't… it doesn't sound like people.

422
00:52:40.580 --> 00:52:52.850
Barnabas: want a call, so I would just propose that we cancel next week's call as well, and we're gonna be back on the 12th of January next year, so almost a month from now.

423
00:52:53.070 --> 00:52:55.739
Barnabas: with the next, Oracle Devs testing.

424
00:53:00.640 --> 00:53:02.959
Barnabas: And I think that's it, for today.

425
00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:06.750
Barnabas: Unless someone has.

426
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.869
Barnabas: Has anything else, Jared?

427
00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.729
Barnabas: Happy holidays, and here's the updated schedule.

428
00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:26.240
Barnabas: And… see you all on the 18th of December on the last Occo Devs call.

429
00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:27.760
Barnabas: this year.

430
00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.160
Barnabas: Thank you, bye-bye.

431
00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:33.890
felipe: Thanks, bye.

432
00:53:34.650 --> 00:53:35.460
Pawan Dhananjay: Thank you.

433
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:36.360
Leo: Bye.

434
00:53:40.070 --> 00:53:41.020
Tullio Canepa | Erigon: Thank you.
