In the PR we've made, builders will be tracked in a new builders list in the state. Some key changes: There is no activation queue for builders. Top-up deposits are instant, as soon as they hit the CL. The minimum builder balance is 1 ETH. Builders will not be able to perform partial withdrawals; only do full exits. Builders cannot be slashed nor penalized, which leads to a few nice simplifications for payments. Builder payments are faster since they don't need to go through the exit queue & min validator withdrawal delay.
00:15:08	Mario Vega:	How would this list be bootstraped at fork boundary?

Refactor process_withdrawals consensus-specs#4765
Refactor get_expected_withdrawals consensus-specs#4766

My first instinct is trusted_payments_accepted is unnecessary as the proposer doesn’t have to adhere to this preference in any way

00:29:12	Raúl Kripalani:	perfect
00:29:20	Alexey:	Replying to "if we will have shor..."

You will have less time for execution?
00:29:36	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Replying to "if we will have shor..."

Yeah, shorter slots should adjust GAS independently
00:30:30	Alexey:	Replying to "if we will have shor..."

I mean in 6 sec slot time 80 will feel like 160
00:31:06	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Replying to "if we will have shor..."

So if we go to 6, at activation gas limit will be halved, independently by current value

I’ve reverted the trusted_payments_accepted change. We can discuss adding that later, if/when the PR is merged.
