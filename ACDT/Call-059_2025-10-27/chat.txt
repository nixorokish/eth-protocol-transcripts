Waren’t there some precompile changes needed for next bump?
00:26:25	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Do we have list of..."

You might mean this one: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7667
 
I thought we decided to remove this last ACDE but maybe my memories might not be correct there (because this is a price increase which was once proposed pre-Fusaka and carried over from the pre-Fusaka fork)
00:30:21	Mario Vega:	I think this is a great idea, we could link this markdown directly in the EIP so people who have an idea of a test scenario can quickly find the link from the EIP

If this is an external URL I don't know if that works
00:32:19	jochem-brouwer:	I think this is a good idea, but the fact that a doc is in the Testing phase of the EIP does not mean that this part is complete. (So should not give a false sense of safety that it is completely covered by tests)
00:32:40	Christine Kim:	Replying to "Do we have list of E..."

7667 was removed, but mainly because of its relation to verkle, https://christinedkim.substack.com/p/acde-223
00:33:02	Pooja Ranjan:	Test Cases (optional) - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for EIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Tests should either be inlined in the EIP as data (such as input/expected output pairs) or included in ../assets/eip-###/<filename>. This section may be omitted for non-Core proposals.

https://steel.ethereum.foundation/blog/blog_posts/2025-09-11_weld-announcement/ 

External Contributors:
- Osaka test and benchmarking contributors can now start PRing to the default execution-specs branch: "forks/osaka".
- But all benchmarkers should be aware of a large renaming underway in "./tests/benchmarks/" 
    - https://github.com/ethereum/execution-specs/pull/1681 
- Amsterdam contributors (balers and gas repricers) should hold off until "forks/amsterdam" has been rebased on top of "forks/osaka"

Clients:
- Fixture releases are still WIP, should be completed this week.
- Hiveview unaffected,

Docs:
- WIP, for testing docs now https://eest.ethereum.org/main/

00:56:32	Gary Rong:	how much processing time would it save if you will not check the storage?
Depends on the number of contract creations within the block. 1 additional read for a contract deployment
00:56:50	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Wasn't there an ei..."

I did not completely get what the changes were supposed to be, but just wanted to note: 7610 is PFId for Glamsterdam. Will await the discussion thread on this topic
00:57:19	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "how much processin..."

But we already need to do the collission check? So it is not an extra read?
00:57:47	Gary Rong:	Wanted to bring up that for 7702 it is thus possible to change delegated code but keep storage
The nonce will be non-zero in this case.

The contract deployment is only allowed for 0 nonce and empty code. With EIP7610, we added the additional requirement for empty storage
00:57:58	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "how much processin..."

(already need to open account RLP to check if it has no code by EIP-684)
00:58:30	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "how much processing ..." 

 Depends on how you store the account
00:58:44	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "how much processin..."

ahh gotcha, i see where the problem is
00:58:45	Gary Rong:	(already need to open account RLP to check if it has no code by EIP-684)
Reth and Erigon don't store the storage root with other account metadata I guess.

For geth, there is no extra read
00:58:58	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "how much processin..."

I assumed every directly stores account RLP
