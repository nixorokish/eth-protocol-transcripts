00:11:10	Ansgar Dietrichs:	did pari just confirm we can hear marius, even though the two of them are in the same room?

(we can indeed hear marius)

00:17:06	jochem-brouwer:	LMK if we need any specific benchmarks, can craft them as state test :)
00:21:16	Ansgar Dietrichs:	dumb question, could a more targeted approach not also work, where we just artificially throttle the state access, even when testing on small state?
00:21:37	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "dumb question, could..."

as in, benchmark worst case access performance on mainnet, and then just use that for testing
00:21:49	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "dumb question, cou..."

this is actually a great idea :)
00:22:15	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "dumb question, cou..."

we could likely check the trie depth on the state test vs mainnet tree depth and multiply the read time with that ratio
00:23:16	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "dumb question, could..."

right. would be worth empirically validating that that ratio roughly matches real world slowdown on mainnet, otherwise that assumption could skew the results
00:24:18	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "dumb question, cou..."

yes good point, this assumption might indeed be too simple and cutting corners ðŸ˜…
