00:17:04	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Are there any backfill blockers or is it mainly time?
00:17:07	Francesco:	Backfill not being implemented shouldn’t cause the problem though, right? If earliest_available_slot is set correctly

00:21:08	FLCL:	want to see it on devnet-2?
00:21:22	Barnabas:	We haven’t officially “included” this for devnet 3 scope. 

Can we all agree that we need this? 

Also can we add forkid to 7910?
00:21:24	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Besu has a PR in review
00:22:10	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	forkId is the currentHash in the EIP, isn;t?
00:22:17	Tim Beiko:	+1 to extending eth_config
00:23:19	Justin Florentine (Besu):	7910 is much broader than forkid
00:23:25	Barnabas:	Could someone make a PR to 7910 regarding the forkid change?
00:23:37	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Replying to "Could someone make a..."

I can do
00:23:41	Barnabas:	Reacted to "I can do" with 👍
00:23:55	Barnabas:	Replying to "Could someone make a..."

it should probably include all historical, and scheduled forks then right?

00:25:53	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Reacted to "7910 will be in scop..." with ➕
00:26:00	Barnabas:	and we will expect clients to have it.
00:29:42	Mario Vega:	@Marcin Sobczak should this be merged for devnet-3: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9969  ?
00:30:09	FLCL:	May it be someone has secp256r1 benchmarks?
00:31:34	Ansgar Dietrichs:	did we not already decide to do the 3x?

2x I think!

(For the curve)
00:32:15	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "did we not already d..."

I thought 2x was the r1

 2x for r1, 3x for modexp
00:33:53	Tim Beiko:	All the feedback I got is that the effect on projects is minimal (for ModExp 3x)

00:36:07	Louis:	What about CLZ gas cost?
00:36:15	Parithosh Jayanthi:	And yeah we can chat in the gas limit testing channel about if 3x still won’t get us to 100M or not, mainly since going beyond that would likely need glamsterdam and a more comprehensive repricing is planned there
00:39:31	Barnabas:	why do you verify builder workflow at all?

00:39:59	Barnabas:	it even makes less sense to verify
00:40:14	J Sunnyside Labs:	Just to add regarding GetBlobs, can we get EL metrics for it standardized across ELs for devnet-3? https://github.com/ethereum/execution-metrics/pull/2

Yeah I realize now that we only verify after we have already signed the block, so doesn’t help us even if its invalid
00:43:40	Barnabas:	lets have the pr open asap imo

this is not transaction cap pr
00:48:27	Toni Wahrstaetter:	If we really want to do this for fusaka, we should change 7825. I put it into a different eip since I assumed fusaka is frozen. 
We might need it in the future (post-fusaka).

00:49:17	spencer-tb:	Feels safer so I am in favour!
00:49:32	jochem-brouwer:	Process wise its basically the same as changing gas price of CLZ. But do we have the analysis that this does not break major things?
00:50:11	Barnabas:	I would just make a pr to 7825.
00:51:45	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	question: system calls will also go to 16M? (they already have a 30M cap today)
