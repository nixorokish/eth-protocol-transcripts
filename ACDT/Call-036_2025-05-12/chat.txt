This means devnet-1 is PeerDAS + “quick fixes”, and then for the next devnet we can consider which “core features” we want

00:36:43	lightclient:	Reacted to "Do we need all clien..." with 🚀
00:38:05	Parithosh Jayanthi:	But if the team cannot hit the deadline, then we have to either launch without besu or delay the devnet

00:38:40	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "But if the team cann..."

Yes, I think launching the devnet without all clients should be fine? 

If we have Reth/Geth/Neth/Erigon (?) that seems sufficient to launch
00:38:48	Barnabas:	EL side changes should be pretty trivial AFAIK ?

Ah makes sense
00:41:05	Francis Li:	can we make it just in fusaka test branch?
00:42:07	Barnabas:	This doesn’t sound like a peerdas issue tho?
00:42:09	Justin Florentine (Besu):	that was our thinking

00:43:22	jochem-brouwer (EthJS):	EthJS will also prep ModExp ASAP so should also join devnet-0 with or without ModExp changes
00:43:32	Justin Florentine (Besu):	totally fine with that

This is true, but feedback on clarfications and improvements on PAY would be nice on the PR: https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9590. Should take less than 30 mins to check :) I will push spec clarification + tests + ref impl. for devnet-1

9 days to be precise, Wednesday
00:50:01	Ansgar Dietrichs:	so would that be added to the peerdas EIP? because I was actually confused by this, I thought I remembered we agreed on a per-tx blob limit, but could not find any CFI’d EIP for it
00:50:10	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "so would that be add..."

so I wonder what the process is for adding it now
00:50:31	Derek G:	Replying to "so would that be a..."

BPO EIP, I believe
00:50:45	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "so would that be add..."

ah. that seems like the wrong place, conceptually
00:51:10	FLCL:	Replying to "so would that be add..."

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9623
00:51:11	Kevaundray Wedderburn:	How does this intersect with the cap on tx size in the network?
00:51:40	FLCL:	Replying to "so would that be add..."

Initially it was an EIP now is an addition to peerdas
00:51:49	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "so would that be add..."

okay that makes sense
00:52:36	Ansgar Dietrichs:	nice thing is that shipping this limit in fusaka this is not super committal, can always be modified (up or down) or even completely lifted in a later fork
