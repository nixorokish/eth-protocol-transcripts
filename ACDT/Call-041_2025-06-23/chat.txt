Yeh! Just waiting for it to finish running
00:14:51	Barnabas:	Replying to "everyone seems to ha..."

I’m guessing its fork digest related issue?
00:15:02	Łukasz Rozmej:	Does it makes sense to include 7907 in devnet 2 without it final spec?We have to now do 7907 just to modify it afterwards. Also benchmarks ect. are not representantive of final form.

We are having issues around that area due to BPO fork digest changes. Still WIP
00:16:20	jochem-brouwer:	I want to present something about 7907 benchmarks :)
00:16:25	Roman:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

would’ve been a good point on ACDT last week or ACDE, but we already decided to go forward with the current spec
00:16:43	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

yeah I raised it on ACDE but was ingorred/speedrun
00:17:04	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

also lack of tests => increased chance of devnet 2 issues
00:17:36	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

I proposed on acde to ship devnet-2 without 7907, but was told that “we had already added 7907 to devnet-2 on the previous acde, would be more work now to remove it again”
00:17:49	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

seems late to revisit now
00:17:57	Roman:	Reacted to "seems late to revisi..." with 👍
00:18:01	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

but in principle I do agree, seems weird to have it in the devnet
00:18:21	Roman:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

but i agree with your concern @Łukasz Rozmej in general and i do think there will be 7907 issues on devnet 2

Looks like Reth/Besu/Nimbus/Erigon basically passing all EEST tests (initial 7907 tests).
Haven’t checked Geth/Nethermind on the EL side yet.

Tmo feels good. But yeah we need more tests for 7907! So could be issues.

Nethermind doens't pass as the implementation isn't finished yet
00:20:20	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Does it makes sense ..."

well devnet-2 could definitely be brought down with adversarial 7907 blocks

and what would the (approximate) timelines for these milestones be?
00:31:38	J Sunnyside Labs:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

00:37:19	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

@Barnabas we had 5000 validators with 100 validators in each node (50 total)

thats too many
00:38:04	Barnabas:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

full nodes should be around 8 validators not 50
00:38:15	Barnabas:	at 50 validators you are almost custoding half of the columns
00:38:35	Justin Traglia:	This is relevant: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/blob/master/processes/protocol-upgrade.md

00:41:14	Phil Ngo:	@Minhyuk Kim For your future updates, would you be able to also post the version hash of the clients you’re using for the tests? That will help us know whether or not some optimizations were included or not with your test results

00:42:00	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

that’s right.. I remember having some flag to fix 8 validators for full node before, but I probably have mixed them up.
00:42:12	Barnabas:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

you probably just want to have 8 validators
00:42:13	J Sunnyside Labs:	Replying to "@Minhyuk Kim For you..."

You can find our configs here: https://github.com/testinprod-io/fusaka-devnets
00:42:20	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

Yea will change that in the future tests

00:43:15	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

but with more validators and custody, the network would be the more performant view of peerdas (a more really happy case), right?
00:43:18	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Reacted to "You can find our con..." with 🙏
00:45:16	Francesco:	Yes, it shouldn’t impact the overall performance. But it would mean that the fullnode bandwidth measurements might be much higher than they should be for a min custody node
00:45:41	Andrés:	yes!
00:46:25	Raúl Kripalani:	Reacted to "You can find our con..." with 🙏
00:46:54	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

Right, we will run a new devnet with proper validator count, and see how the bandwidth usage / other metrics compare with our previous tests
00:46:59	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

thank you guys!

00:49:36	Marius:	Tests are run on perfnet, transactions are send with a script, 1 30M tx at a time
00:49:57	Francesco:	Replying to "Screenshot2025_06_23_162215.jpg"

Still it’s very curious that lighthouse and grandine are using so much less bandwidth
00:52:07	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "can we introduce get..."

yes, but the convention is to upgrade at forks, right? so if we find say 48 blobs (~6MiB) to add a noticeable base64 serde-related penalty, we'd have to wait til Glamsterdam to roll out a new version -- that's what i was trying to hedge against (even though it's technically possible to roll out new versions without fork coordination)
00:52:19	Ameziane Hamlat:	Ok thanks, we found a performance issue on ExtCodeSize on besu, will push the fix, if we can trigger them again
00:57:33	Ansgar Dietrichs:	if we want to do it inside the state tree, we can’t possibly do it in Fusaka though
00:57:40	Łukasz Rozmej:	verkle fixed this :D
00:57:54	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "if we want to do it ..."

in general, I would argue any index is just too last minute for Fusaka
00:58:13	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "if we want to do it ..."

I think we need to benchmark whether it is robust enough even without index. if not, I don’t see a responsible way to ship this in fusaka
01:01:46	Ansgar Dietrichs:	how many EL clients looked into the code size index at all so far? how confident are we that we will have everything we need to make a final decision on that by acde in 10 days?
01:02:17	Barnabas:	devnet 3 should only have repricing EIPs
