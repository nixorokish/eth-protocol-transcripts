That’s cool 🙂

I don’t think ePBS fixes this, if a staked builder doesn’t implement the builder-api, we could kinda get fucked regardless lmaoo
00:10:29	Ameziane Hamlat:	Reacted to "p2p team did somethi..." with ❤️
00:10:38	Bharath:	Replying to "sounds like epbs fix..."

And by builder-api I mean the direct connection from proposer to builder

00:12:54	James He:	This isn’t something specific to fulu, but fulu definitely made it a lot worse, https://github.com/OffchainLabs/prysm/issues/16096, this also includes a work around , the workaround isn’t perfect but it’s a solution until we have something more permanent in

staked builders would be required to have builder-api.
00:16:04	Barnabas:	Replying to "sounds like epbs fix..."

otherwise they couldn’t be a builder no?

Not necessarily, if they have staked the amount with a 0x03 withdraw credential. You become a builder. 
I guess if you don’t implement the builder-api its still fine since you can use the p2p bidpool

00:21:47	nflaig:	Replying to "sounds like epbs fix..."

if the builder has a bug you would still have a slot with an empty execution payload

the difference is that the CL part of the block would not be missed but that's due to the decoupling of CL<>EL block, not really related to whether you have staked builders or not

Builders have an incentive to include blobs for the blob fees. Relays are just an intermediate without incentives/disincentives.

not at the moment, but once we have the correlations we may see some interesting patterns. in parallel we can ask builders/relays

yep it might just be that the builders that work with Flashbots bias towards 0 blobs

00:27:17	Justin Traglia:	In prep for the ePBS update. We had a breakout call on Friday. Talked about dynamic penalties (solves the free option problem), the non-staked builder api, and trustless payments. We’re going to make the decision on trustless payments (keep or remove) at ACDC this Thursday.

A short recap:
https://x.com/JustinTraglia/status/1997021426914668843

The next breakout call is Dec 19th:
https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1835 

Which happens to be the last ePBS breakout call. Starting in 2026, we would like to discuss dev updates here at ACDT.

I was a little confused by calling relays and block builders the opinion of the community. Are RPC providers also community?

100%. community is much wider. “out of protocol block building actors” is maybe what was meant.

00:37:32	Bharath:	Replying to "maybe quick note tha..."

Yeah we need to weigh out the pros and cons for staked and unstaked builders. 
https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4733  allows builders to specify off-protocol payments they want to make. We definitely will have a builder-api for staked builders which seems to be similar to the status quo today. It seems to me that relays can stake 32eth, become a builder and just opt out of trustless payments?
00:38:02	Bharath:	Replying to "maybe quick note tha..."

My initial hand at the builder-api for unstaked builders, it seems like it could get a bit complicated for clients and relays. Complexity is always debatable tho

00:40:12	spencer-tb:	Reacted to "https://github.com/e..." with ❤️
00:42:46	Barnabas:	maybe bundle similar type EIPs together?
00:42:52	Barnabas:	instead of having all its own release?
00:44:40	Barnabas:	I think its up to the STEEL team, what they prefer
00:44:42	Barnabas:	and which is faster
00:44:57	Barnabas:	if we have to spend weeks rebasing it later, then maybe better to just have everything be based on top of BALs
00:45:05	Marc:	seems a bit simpler to test with BALs but no strong preference
00:45:15	Stefan Starflinger:	makes sense
