Mario Vega: Hello.

2
00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.239
Akash | ECH: Hey, hey Mario, I'm helping with the stream today, so let me know whenever you are ready.

3
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.340
Mario Vega: Thank you very much. Yeah, I'll… I'll let you know.

4
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:36.829
Akash | ECH: Okay.

5
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.540
spencer-tb: Hello!

6
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.340
Mario Vega: He's better.

7
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.360
Fredrik: Hello?

8
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:30.910
Mario Vega: Hey.

9
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.000
Mario Vega: Let's just give one more minute, and we can start.

10
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.250
Mario Vega: I think we can start.

11
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.109
Akash | ECH: We are live.

12
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:39.509
Mario Vega: Thank you, Vikesh. Good day, everyone. Welcome to ACDT number 63. Today is December 8th, 2025. We have a very light agenda, but the… I think the most important discussion point is that, Fusaka Fork happened last week, and

13
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:54.969
Mario Vega: went well. But yeah, for the first point, I would like to start with… yeah, congratulations, everyone. For the first point, I would like to touch upon the events that happened, if…

14
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:05.540
Mario Vega: anyone from any team, I think Prism is one of the ones that wants to share more in this section. Is anyone from Prism here? Should we start with them?

15
00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:19.299
Mario Vega: If not, Parnabas, do you have, any events that happened during the fork that are important and meaningful that we should share?

16
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:39.130
Barnabas: Yeah, so prison attestations came in a bit late, and this ended up in a cascading effect. They had a flag to fix the issue, that was already included in their latest release in 7.0.0, and they said that they would push out a proper fix, sometime today.

17
00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.199
Barnabas: I haven't heard anything from them since, but hoping in a new Prism release for

18
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.610
Barnabas: Early this week, but ideally by end of today.

19
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.799
Mario Vega: Alright, thanks.

20
00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:11.800
Mario Vega: Yeah, I think we can give some time from someone to present to you, if they want to expand. From any other teams, do we have any important events that are worth sharing here? Findings, or reports, bugs found?

21
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.470
Mario Vega: Anything?

22
00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.090
Bharath: Yeah, I mean, I can share one thing, so…

23
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:28.470
Bharath: I don't think there's any impact in this, but, one of the things… this is through going through the Titan relays,

24
00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:39.160
Bharath: GitHub, I noticed that… so we introduced a Get Payload V2 for Fusaka. I noticed they have a bug fix where we didn't… where they didn't add it… add it to the routes.

25
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:49.529
Bharath: like, basically, like, they didn't add it to their API routes. That would ideally have caused, like, payload… the API not found, but I think, luckily, we had,

26
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.450
Bharath: Fallbacks in both commit boost and ref boost to, like, avoid this.

27
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:59.399
Bharath: So, I just thought, like, that's something kind of notable, but I… there wasn't, like, any impact

28
00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.700
Bharath: on that, as far as I'm aware, like…

29
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:07.590
Bharath: So, yeah, I think if that… the fallbacks weren't there, there would have been a bunch of missed slots, so…

30
00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.410
Bharath: But, yeah, but I wanted to, like, point that out.

31
00:08:12.670 --> 00:08:13.430
Mario Vega: Thank you.

32
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.920
Mario Vega: Was there any impact on network stability that was worth sharing, or…

33
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:22.199
Mario Vega: Wasn't you… wasn't not noticeable.

34
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:33.320
Bharath: Oh, no, on the Get Payload V2, there was an impact, because the client's MevBoost and CommitBoost both implement, like, fallback, so when we call V2 and it's not there, we fall back to, like, the V1 API.

35
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:40.080
Bharath: So, the V1 API hash is definitely… has to be implemented, otherwise the relay wouldn't be alive. So,

36
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:47.989
Bharath: So yeah, so there wasn't, like, any impact, because we also noticed no, like, missed slots in that aspect. There was no impact on that, and

37
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:52.280
Bharath: Yeah, but it was something, like, worth, like, just bringing out and, like, letting you guys know.

38
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:54.440
Mario Vega: Thank you. Thank you.

39
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:06.890
Mario Vega: Cool. Any… any other findings or comments from other client teams that is worth sharing in this meeting?

40
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:32.979
Mario Vega: Alright, I think… I think not. That's… that's actually good. I see a comment from the peer-to-peer team, no, sorry, for Barnabas,

41
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:38.759
Mario Vega: Raul, do you want to expand? I see you also commented on this.

42
00:09:39.030 --> 00:10:01.280
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I just wanted to give a short update on some data we've been collecting from Mainnet in preparation for BP01, just to kind of, like, maybe give a bird's-eye view of how things are progressing, and what we've seen, and maybe some recommendations. Not necessarily for BPO1, which is coming tomorrow, but for next BPO upgrades. Is it okay if I share my screen?

43
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:03.430
Mario Vega: Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.629
Raúl Kripalani: Absolutely. Very cool. Let me, get this ready.

45
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:32.770
Raúl Kripalani: So, what… the link that Barnabas shared is actually from a small set of notebooks that we're putting together, and this is going to be enhanced over the next few days. We're hoping to basically get different perspectives and vantage points into the network from different, areas to kind of, like, keep tabs on how things are going. So, the first notebook that I wanted to show here is,

46
00:10:32.770 --> 00:10:56.199
Raúl Kripalani: one that shows blob inclusion, so that's basically the patterns that we're seeing in terms of how many blocks, were, including how many blobs over time, and you can see that, kind of like the most popular ones, the most popular blob counts are 9, which means that we are obviously at, like, almost, saturation right now. Then you do see some, some density, some more density on 6,

47
00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:13.500
Raúl Kripalani: 3 and 0. Some blobs, some blobs didn't include any blobs, we'll… we'll touch on that briefly now. This is another similar view, but this is breaking it down by epoch, so you can see kind of, like, a little bit of a flame graph-ish view on how many blobs were

48
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.930
Raúl Kripalani: How many blocks included how many blobs?

49
00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:40.920
Raúl Kripalani: In a particular epoch, and you can see some interesting patterns here, like, for example, there was an epoch that included a high rate of, of, blocks with no blobs. Sorry, I don't know why I can't zoom in here. Other graphs allow me to zoom in, but not this one. So this one, and then kind of like the next epochs actually compensated for that by stretching and including 9 blobs. So we see that elasticity in the mempool, and that elasticity in

50
00:11:40.920 --> 00:12:01.580
Raúl Kripalani: inclusion, which is great. We see the same pattern here again. We're actually investigating exactly what might have happened here. They were kind of like a sequence of 9 or 7 blocks, I think, that were… that didn't include any blobs. So we're actually, you know, finding patterns here and then doing deep dives, so I'll probably have another further update to share at another point.

51
00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:13.080
Raúl Kripalani: This is a pivoted view of the same thing, but this is, showing, yeah, just, just a different view, where we see that, exactly that, that pattern. So, what we see here is that.

52
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.260
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, so most,

53
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:25.419
Raúl Kripalani: We… we're actually seeing blobs included, and especially kind of, like, a high rate in the… in the, edge saturation there, the max blobs.

54
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:39.650
Raúl Kripalani: Sorry, that went out. And then, these are some other views. These are, like, maybe some visual… more visual candy. This is one… actually, let me go into column propagation, because this is the first one that I wanted to point out some patterns on.

55
00:12:39.650 --> 00:13:03.840
Raúl Kripalani: So what we see here is, basically a… all this data that I'm showing you is just from yesterday. These notebooks are going to be regenerated on a daily basis, and we'll probably add, more, longer periods and longer views, so that we can keep tabs on, kind of like, you know, the evolution side of things. And what we see here is, for… rows are columns.

56
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:17.030
Raúl Kripalani: And these correspond to column subnets, and then this is the passage of time, and we're actually plotting for every slot, when do we see the first column? Sorry, when do we see the first copy of each column?

57
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:35.719
Raúl Kripalani: So you can see some very interesting patterns here, where you see that there's actually a lot of similarity. If you look at the Z value here as I'm scrolling, as I'm moving my mouse down, you see that that is actually changing on a per column basis. Sorry, I just moved across slots, so you saw it change more than it does within a slot.

58
00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:54.520
Raúl Kripalani: But you see there, like, the moment that we see a first column, we're basically, like, practically seeing all other… all other columns, at the same time. This data, by the way, is collected from, ETH PandaOps' Shattoo deployment. We need to qualify it a little bit better, because there's a mixture of nodes, so different nodes might be seeing different things.

59
00:13:54.520 --> 00:14:09.079
Raúl Kripalani: And of course, we're plotting the min for every column here, so there might be some adjustment that's needed here. But yeah, some interesting bits is that we do have some slots where, for example, the first column, the first copy of every column was seen, kind of like.

60
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:22.669
Raúl Kripalani: 200 milliseconds before the attestation deadline, and this is, like, starts to be problematic. We need to correlate this with blob count and a bunch of other things, so, so, it's again, like, this will be enhanced.

61
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:38.040
Raúl Kripalani: But yeah, you see, kind of, like, when the first column is seen, then the rest of the columns are practically seen at the same time. This is a similar graph, but more sensitive. This is actually computing the interest lot delta from the fastest column.

62
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:45.590
Raúl Kripalani: And plotting it in milliseconds. This… the timescale is… so you see the sensitivity here? Like, practically…

63
00:14:46.020 --> 00:15:03.790
Raúl Kripalani: once we see the first column, all of the columns are seen, like, within 250 milliseconds, which confirms this sort of pattern here. But what I found interesting is this one. Delta normalized is just… so this is in millisecond terms, and this would be in percent terms, so basically.

64
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:16.329
Raúl Kripalani: If 0 is the slow… is the fastest column and 1 is the slowest column, then what is the pattern that we're seeing here? And you see that in general, like, we see some banding, which is very interesting, so we see that…

65
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:27.069
Raúl Kripalani: The first columns are actually seen sooner, so, and this makes sense, because clients are probably, blog builders, sorry, blog builders are probably…

66
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:37.489
Raúl Kripalani: Pushing columns sequentially through the network, starting from zero and then progressing up until 127, zero indexed. And…

67
00:15:37.710 --> 00:15:55.849
Raúl Kripalani: And yeah, so we see more… so these are the first columns that we see, but then we see some banding as well, which is very interesting. We're investigating where this is coming from, because it doesn't necessarily come from, like, you know, binary, like, indices or anything like that, so it might just be that the subnets behind…

68
00:15:55.850 --> 00:16:03.719
Raúl Kripalani: The meshes behind these custody subnets are actually stronger, or are better resourced, but you do see, like.

69
00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:13.030
Raúl Kripalani: some… some stepping there, which is very interesting. So we're trying to, like, dig into… into that, and I think we'll have some… some data. And then the one that Barnabas,

70
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:31.040
Raúl Kripalani: deep link to is the… the blob flow. So we're… we've charted, once again, using shadow data, which is super, super helpful, which also pulls for meats here. We are seeing, what we see here is which proposers are… proposer entities are including how many… how many blobs.

71
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:48.690
Raúl Kripalani: This is a direct relationship between proposers and number of blobs, and then, relays to blob counts, so we wanted to check, is there a pattern? Are some relays including, like, you know, favoring blobs or, like, specific block counts or not?

72
00:16:48.830 --> 00:17:05.640
Raúl Kripalani: we just see, kind of, like, for reference purposes, a proposer-to-entity relay, so we see, like, which proposers… proposer entities are using which relays, and then finally, I think this, like, puts everything together. This will be the most interesting one, out of here, that kind of, like.

73
00:17:05.650 --> 00:17:10.790
Raúl Kripalani: connects all the dots across the board. There's really, like, the spread is pretty…

74
00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:29.080
Raúl Kripalani: uniform. Not uniform, but I would say, like, there's no pattern that really stands out here, except for, one that I pointed out to the flashbots, people, which is we do see that they're, proportionally to the amount of blocks that they, that they relay.

75
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:38.579
Raúl Kripalani: they have a larger, like, they, they are above average in zero blobs, essentially. That's kind of, like, the one thing that stood out.

76
00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:48.790
Raúl Kripalani: So yeah, having done that, that overview, very brief overview, I do want to go, I wanted to go back to the column propagation one.

77
00:17:48.790 --> 00:18:03.430
Raúl Kripalani: Because this pattern is denoting that we're… that there's some room for optimization in dispatching quantums to the network, and I wanted to propose… what I wanted to propose to CLs here is there was an optimization that we shipped, a few months back.

78
00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.319
Raúl Kripalani: Which is, in Gossip Tub, it is a…

79
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:15.010
Raúl Kripalani: What we called batch publish, but essentially this is a breadth-first policy for getting columns out.

80
00:18:15.010 --> 00:18:32.710
Raúl Kripalani: as a builder, or as a node that happens to have those columns… that happens to have all blobs, and therefore you can source them from get blobs, and you're able to publish the message in the first place, so you don't even need to wait for the builder's propagation.

81
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:48.359
Raúl Kripalani: So, in these two cases, it's gonna help to do a breadth-first dispatch. So that is, with batch publish, we're giving 128 columns directly to Gossip Sub, and then today, most implementations, if they don't use

82
00:18:48.360 --> 00:19:00.300
Raúl Kripalani: breadth-first dispatch. What they're gonna do is they're gonna prioritize, sending all 6 or 8, or 10 copies, or whatever the mesh degree is, for every column… for every column.

83
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:10.210
Raúl Kripalani: First, and then they would move on to the next column, and so on, and so on, and that could be justifying the pattern that we see here. So with best breath-first dispatch.

84
00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:22.240
Raúl Kripalani: What we'd be doing is basically prioritizing sending, like, at least two copies of each column first, and then we continue deepening the replication in each… the redundancy in each subnet.

85
00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:33.680
Raúl Kripalani: So that would be one of the things that we propose. This is already implemented in Go Gossip Sub, so for the Prism team, it's going to be quite easy to adopt once they upgrade Gossip Sub.

86
00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:47.809
Raúl Kripalani: I heard from Joao and others that maybe it's not needed in Lighthouse, but I wanted to double-click on that, and then wanted to check with other teams as well. Of course, this is, like, this change would not be consensus-breaking in any way, it's just a network optimization.

87
00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:53.670
Raúl Kripalani: So, I'll stop sharing there, and just wait for any questions.

88
00:19:55.660 --> 00:20:12.969
Mario Vega: Thank you so much. Any questions on this? I think we… since this was a little bit impromptu, we might need to revisit the topic also in ACDC, if possible, just to check if anyone is missing from this conversation, they should be aware of it on ACDC. But yeah, Pawan?

89
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:25.170
Pawan Dhananjay: Yeah, hi, quick question, did you also measure anything with… related to get blobs effectiveness? Like, are we still seeing private blobs at all, or.

90
00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:25.500
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah.

91
00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.810
Pawan Dhananjay: Yeah, just wanted to see if there's any difference between.

92
00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:28.480
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah.

93
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.270
Pawan Dhananjay: Cop.

94
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:37.269
Raúl Kripalani: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a great question. Actually, we need to correlate this data with precisely presence of blobs in the mempool.

95
00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:49.799
Raúl Kripalani: with missed slots, and with a bunch of other things that we have in mind, so not yet, but hopefully by today or tomorrow, we'll be having that correlation, and I'm happy to send people a link in Discord.

96
00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.150
Mario Vega: Cool, any other questions?

97
00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:20.109
Mario Vega: Alright, I think not, amazing presentation, Raul. Thank you so much for sharing.

98
00:21:20.430 --> 00:21:28.179
Mario Vega: Alright, so, circling back, to Fusaka, because I see that someone from Prism joined.

99
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.210
Mario Vega: Is a… is a…

100
00:21:31.810 --> 00:21:47.369
Mario Vega: Who was it? James. Yeah, James from Prism, do you have any… because we touched upon the topic of Fusaka at first, and I think Prism would like to, if they have any updates to, the events that happened during Maynet, so,

101
00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:54.459
Mario Vega: just wanted to chime in to see if you have any… any updates on that, or anyone else from Prism, if they're listening.

102
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:56.890
James He: Yeah,

103
00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:09.410
James He: I guess we're trying to do another release with a more permanent fix. Hopefully that comes out today, if not the next few days.

104
00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:22.279
James He: And, POTUS is also helping write up a technical post-mortem, and we'll have, like, a more official post-mortem, as, as well.

105
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.059
James He: And the new release will have a backfill in it.

106
00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:37.580
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you. Thank you for the update.

107
00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.720
Mario Vega: Alright,

108
00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:48.790
Mario Vega: Alright, so yeah, with Fusaka out of the door, we have also BPO Fork number 1 happening tomorrow, in less than…

109
00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.630
Mario Vega: Exactly 24 hours, almost.

110
00:22:53.160 --> 00:23:04.039
Mario Vega: I just wanted to bring up the topic to see if anyone had any, necessary comments on this, are we good to go? Or any concerns, that can be raised?

111
00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:06.250
Mario Vega: At this point.

112
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.009
Mario Vega: Yeah, I guess not much to say on that topic. We will monitor the chain tomorrow when the fork happens, and…

113
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:31.669
Mario Vega: Stay in the comps to see, that everything goes smoothly.

114
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:34.730
Mario Vega: Alright,

115
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:41.680
Mario Vega: With that, any other topics on Fusaka, or any other comments on Fusaka that anyone wants to share today?

116
00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.969
Mario Vega: If not, we can go directly to Glamsterdam.

117
00:23:55.090 --> 00:24:04.769
Mario Vega: Yeah, alright, so the first topic in the agenda for Amsterdam is… Amsterdam is, block-level access list. Do we have anyone in the call that would like to share some updates on this?

118
00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:11.039
Stefan Starflinger: I can maybe start out giving some updates from our side.

119
00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:24.070
Stefan Starflinger: So we've been running the Kotosys testnets a lot, and I managed to get a new milestone of 13 epochs running with 4 clients, which is the most we've done so far, so that's pretty nice.

120
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:32.140
Stefan Starflinger: Otherwise, I think NetherMound has now also added the debug endpoint. I will share, kind of, the link.

121
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:48.850
Stefan Starflinger: in the chat, if clients, can, if possible, add the debug endpoint, update the debug bad blocks endpoint to add the generated block accesses, that would be great, so it's easier to debug. I think we have now Nethermine and Bezo that have it.

122
00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:57.870
Stefan Starflinger: Otherwise, we've been finding still quite a few issues in the kurtosis network, so we would recommend the clients all

123
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:11.449
Stefan Starflinger: run with the EVM fuzzer still to see if there are any issues with their clients. I think that's the easiest way, kind of, to figure out if there are any inconsistencies still. Even if you pass all the tests, we're still finding some issues.

124
00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:17.590
Stefan Starflinger: For example, a recent one, maybe Felipe can talk about it more also.

125
00:25:17.910 --> 00:25:20.060
Stefan Starflinger: If you're on the call,

126
00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.999
Stefan Starflinger: About, kind of, some of the tests that you've been working on?

127
00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.749
Stefan Starflinger: And that will be in the next release.

128
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:29.510
felipe: Yeah, sure.

129
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:36.249
felipe: Yeah, we've, we've been finding, basically, gas boundary issues in…

130
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:39.780
felipe: I think you found one, Stefan.

131
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.719
felipe: With, self-destruct.

132
00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:47.700
felipe: And so we've been working on adding, tests around,

133
00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:52.820
felipe: Checking gas before account excesses, all throughout,

134
00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:55.049
felipe: The spec where this is found.

135
00:25:55.730 --> 00:26:06.130
felipe: And right now, we have, I would say, probably one or two new cases of this, and we already had quite a few in the last releases.

136
00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:10.420
felipe: But we hope to get these reviewed…

137
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.969
felipe: And merged in and released, early this week.

138
00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:24.549
felipe: for clients to be testing against. And anything that we're finding in kurtosis, we've been trying to write tests for as well. Although sometimes, without these

139
00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:29.449
felipe: Debug endpoints, they're not as easy to find, so these would help quite a bit.

140
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:47.809
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, and also, I think most clients now have it in their logging, when there is a disagreement that you log either just the minimal div, or just log the whole log-level access list, so it's easier in the tests and also in the kurtosis networks to see what is the difference.

141
00:26:48.090 --> 00:26:57.479
Stefan Starflinger: That's been very nice. And, like, my goal would be to start a DevNet. I've actually already, accidentally started DevNet.

142
00:26:57.850 --> 00:27:14.010
Stefan Starflinger: But I can't really run any load on it, because it will, basically, fall apart pretty quickly. So, we will probably start DevNet1 once, Kurtosis is running for at least 24 hours, with at least 3 clients.

143
00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:19.479
Stefan Starflinger: that's kind of the benchmark where I would like to start, like, a proper definite.

144
00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:31.430
Stefan Starflinger: I think that's pretty much it from… from my side. And we… One more update we've added in was… yeah, it's caught up with most of the log-level access lists, so that's pretty nice.

145
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.210
Stefan Starflinger: Tests.

146
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:41.149
Mario Vega: Excellent. Thanks so much. Yeah.

147
00:27:41.450 --> 00:27:43.400
Mario Vega: Yeah, yeah, Bliss, go ahead.

148
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:49.399
raxhvl: Yeah, I've been also working on some, some of the last bunch of tests.

149
00:27:49.550 --> 00:27:51.869
raxhvl: Those cover system contracts.

150
00:27:52.160 --> 00:28:01.540
raxhvl: So those, like, beacon Root and other system operations, trying to see if those work in isolation well, and with,

151
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.159
raxhvl: User contracts, so we should have those.

152
00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.069
raxhvl: In their messages.

153
00:28:18.890 --> 00:28:19.710
Mario Vega: Thank you.

154
00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.850
Mario Vega: Alright, any comments, from…

155
00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.660
Mario Vega: Yield apps on block level access list.

156
00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:53.059
Mario Vega: If not, thanks so much, Stefan and Felipe, for the work that you guys have been putting on this, and yes, it's nice to hear that even though we are having failures, we are creating tests with it, so I think that's very helpful and very fruitful.

157
00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.819
Mario Vega: So yeah, let's see if we can launch the number one in the following weeks.

158
00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.210
Mario Vega: Cool.

159
00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:17.480
Mario Vega: So, if nothing else from Volko Alexis, thanks for sharing the updates. We can move on to EPBS, and I see that Justin Jory shared a update on the comments. Would you like to, chime in?

160
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:19.260
Justin Traglia: Yeah, sure. Thanks.

161
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:22.750
Justin Traglia: I can just give a recap of what I just said then.

162
00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:28.919
Justin Traglia: Yeah, we had a breakout call on Friday. It was very long, it went, like, 25 minutes over.

163
00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:35.689
Justin Traglia: We talked about dynamic penalties, which, could solve the free option problem, for… yeah.

164
00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.399
Justin Traglia: in EPBS and out of EPBS.

165
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:46.800
Justin Traglia: The non-Staked Builder API from Brath, there's a Discord thread that we can talk about that in, if you want.

166
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:56.140
Justin Traglia: And, trustless payments. We didn't make a decision about trustless payments, at the breakout call, but we're planning to make that decision.

167
00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:00.110
Justin Traglia: At ACDC, this week.

168
00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:05.719
Justin Traglia: So please review the arguments from, like, both sides, so that we're prepared to make a decision.

169
00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:17.589
Justin Traglia: The next breakout call is December 19th, and that's also the last EPBS breakout call. We'll start doing that here at ACD… ACDT.

170
00:30:17.890 --> 00:30:19.890
Justin Traglia: Starting in 2026.

171
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:25.250
Justin Traglia: And then I've been personally working on refactoring withdrawals code and the specs.

172
00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:26.620
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

173
00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.080
Justin Traglia: Do client teams have any updates?

174
00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.750
Mario Vega: Just to surface one comment from Barnabas,

175
00:30:54.350 --> 00:31:01.089
Mario Vega: last Friday on the call, we didn't hear any significant amount of argument why we should remove trustless payments.

176
00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.539
Justin Traglia: Debatable, I don't know.

177
00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.300
Mario Vega: Desperate.

178
00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.139
Bharath: Yeah, I think one thing outside trustless payments, in EPP, yes, is that,

179
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.720
Bharath: One thing, to… to make a decision on and to decide is whether

180
00:31:23.130 --> 00:31:28.960
Bharath: we will have, unstaked builders in EPBS, like, so there's been debate on,

181
00:31:29.190 --> 00:31:32.320
Bharath: Whether, clients will even, like, reach out to

182
00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.499
Bharath: Builders who are not staked, or whether will we have builders

183
00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:42.370
Bharath: Right? Basically, whether… today, none of the builders are staked, right? We have off-chain entities.

184
00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:49.229
Bharath: The decision of whether, like, clients are gonna, like, only support, like, stake builders versus, like.

185
00:31:49.390 --> 00:31:57.929
Bharath: okay, we're gonna support… we're also gonna, like, talk to stake builders, and also gonna talk to unstake builders. I think that's probably also a decision,

186
00:31:58.170 --> 00:32:06.779
Bharath: we might want to make. I don't think that'll happen in ACDC on Thursday, but I think it's just… it's a conversation, because there are some implications, like.

187
00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:15.520
Bharath: we probably wouldn't have to maintain, like, the builder specs anymore. I think MevBoost would kind of, like, get out of the picture based on that decision.

188
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:19.169
Bharath: So, yeah, on my part, like.

189
00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:38.829
Bharath: I have written a couple… a design for the builder API, like, I've iterated also a little bit from last Friday, from the EPBS breakout, because regardless of whether we support staked or unstaked, it's a useful data point to have on how the builder API will look like, so that we can make a decision, like, like, oh, it's too complex, it's not worth it.

190
00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.259
Bharath: Something like that. So… so yeah, that's… that's another decision,

191
00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:54.970
Bharath: we probably have to make for EPBS. I've heard a bunch of conflicting opinions, so… yeah, it's probably… as Justin mentioned, there is a thread in the Discord chat, so that's a conversation, like,

192
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:57.520
Bharath: Like, I think we should start and, like, move on, right?

193
00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:07.810
Mario Vega: Thank you.

194
00:33:13.050 --> 00:33:17.109
Mario Vega: Alright, and one good comment from Katya,

195
00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:27.109
Mario Vega: is… there's a question about whether we should be defining some PBS metrics across clients, to gather during DevNets. I think that's… that's important.

196
00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:37.240
Mario Vega: Do you have any idea on that, or is it too early to decide?

197
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:53.869
Mario Vega: Alright, maybe it started. Cool. Any other comments on EPVS?

198
00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:25.349
Mario Vega: If not, we can move on. Please, join the ACDC to continue discussing this, and also the breakout call on December 19th to join the discussion.

199
00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:28.159
Mario Vega: To make the decision about rotors pavements.

200
00:34:28.350 --> 00:34:33.210
Mario Vega: Alright, so moving on, on the last topic of the agenda, we have the,

201
00:34:33.370 --> 00:34:37.660
Mario Vega: The gas topic, or basically the stateless, sorry, the state,

202
00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.730
Mario Vega: Benchmarking, and compute benchmarking.

203
00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:50.170
Mario Vega: Do we have, any updates on this topic? Camila, I see that you are on the call. Anything to share here?

204
00:34:50.179 --> 00:34:50.779
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah.

205
00:34:51.089 --> 00:35:01.579
Kamil Chodoła: Hi. So, we have two things which we are working on right now. Most importantly, focusing with all our efforts right now on repricings.

206
00:35:01.789 --> 00:35:18.569
Kamil Chodoła: So we have a tooling, how to tackle that. We are just making some improvements. On a Thursday, I noticed a few of the scenarios which are not behaving properly under the EST Execute, which Louis is taking a look at right now.

207
00:35:18.679 --> 00:35:21.709
Kamil Chodoła: So we'll have a better approach for that.

208
00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:34.619
Kamil Chodoła: Last week also, we confirmed some stateful scenarios performance, which improved on Nethermine sites, specifically, because Nethermine seems like it's a little bit slower than others because of the DP design.

209
00:35:34.789 --> 00:35:43.839
Kamil Chodoła: And right now, our efforts internally are in determined arms to make a better DB design, to not be a blocker for any potential future gas increases.

210
00:35:44.469 --> 00:36:04.349
Kamil Chodoła: And yeah, so… and one more thing is we have this new process for filtered, what, 100 megacity blocks for a compute testing. I've seen updates from Spencer on that, and want to include that so we have a better… more frequent updates of testing scenarios out there.

211
00:36:05.139 --> 00:36:20.549
Kamil Chodoła: So, yes, we are progressing. I want to make some… make sure that maybe some further bump of 75 megas blocks is viable in short term, but doing some improvements to confirm that.

212
00:36:25.830 --> 00:36:30.699
Mario Vega: Excellent. Yes, thanks. On the artifacts for…

213
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:38.330
Mario Vega: 100 million gas tests. We do have a new workflow, and it should be running at the moment. Basically, this is gonna generate

214
00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:46.620
Mario Vega: New benchmark tests, state, fixtures, sorry, to… To be released.

215
00:36:46.850 --> 00:36:57.019
Mario Vega: On a more frequent basis, and this is just gonna be a release of 100 million gas. So, this should be available using the artifacts download, come on, come online from GitHub.

216
00:36:57.270 --> 00:37:02.270
Mario Vega: I think we can share more, more details on how to access this, this,

217
00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:17.200
Mario Vega: this async. But yeah, basically the idea is that we are gonna be able to make releases… not releases, not for releases, but the tests, they're gonna be available much sooner than the release cycle that we've been having so far, up until now.

218
00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:25.230
Mario Vega: Cool. Thank you, Camille, for the update.

219
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:28.010
Mario Vega: And yeah, Spencer just shared,

220
00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.320
Mario Vega: The details on this, on this update, on the, on the, on the artifacts.

221
00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:41.339
Mario Vega: Excellent. Anything else on this topic that anyone wants to chime in?

222
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:55.749
Kamil Chodoła: Yes, just last thing is that for repricings, which are very tightly related to gas bumps for future, internally, nevermind, we are working on better traceability of the blocks from the past.

223
00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:04.170
Kamil Chodoła: So right now, we have only RPC calls, and RPC is quite slow for tracing the historical blocks,

224
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:11.390
Kamil Chodoła: Or at least to check the… how the blocks look like, so not full traces, but for… but only opcode traces.

225
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:25.939
Kamil Chodoła: And right now, we have a Netarmind plugin, which is capable of tracing… tracing quite a huge chunk of blocks very, very fast, just to get information which opcodes were used.

226
00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.940
Kamil Chodoła: Right now, it's under testing,

227
00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:33.259
Kamil Chodoła: Right now, executing a trace for 1 million blocks of Sepolia.

228
00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:39.850
Kamil Chodoła: And it will be much, much faster than MPC stuff, but it's still waiting for the result and some… fixing some issues.

229
00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:53.310
Kamil Chodoła: But this might be interesting, so anyone interested in such data, let me know if you have anything you would like to learn more. Just accept the round number of upcodes per range of blocks.

230
00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:03.429
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you. Do you have a link for this, or.

231
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:11.940
Kamil Chodoła: Not yet linked, because this is, like, very, very early stage. I mean, we are right now testing it. Once PR will be published, I will send the link.

232
00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.179
Mario Vega: Of course, thank you.

233
00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:24.719
Mario Vega: Cool. Anything else anyone wants to share about the, benchmarking?

234
00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:36.709
Marcin Sobczak: Yeah, we have, we have a spec for, for newer PC endpoint testing period block.

235
00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:54.980
Marcin Sobczak: it will be, to… to be blocked from provided transactions, and, like, SPAC is drafted, and, we have, proof of concept implementation in our mind, and I also saw that REF has some implementations, so,

236
00:39:55.190 --> 00:40:05.730
Marcin Sobczak: We are at this page, and in Nevermind, I need to fix a few minor issues, so it's generally written, but I need to fix it to work overly.

237
00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:14.350
Mario Vega: Thank you. I shared the link for this, this proposal, please take a look.

238
00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:16.800
Mario Vega: I think it's important that we decide

239
00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:36.520
Mario Vega: on what do we want out of this, endpoint. It's also gonna help testing, because it, in theory, we should be able to even field tests using this endpoint, so it's gonna be very, very fruitful. So please chime in, if you have any ideas, especially from other EL

240
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.780
Mario Vega: clients,

241
00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:51.060
Mario Vega: If you have, like, comments, or if you think this is gonna be… there's gonna be trouble implementing this, just please, right… right now is the correct time to… to come in and chime in into… into… into this new proposal.

242
00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.289
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you, Marxing.

243
00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:07.439
Mario Vega: Yeah, alright, I think we… with that, we finished the last topic. Do we have any other…

244
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:10.370
Mario Vega: Any other topics that anyone wants to chime in?

245
00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:12.190
Mario Vega: Before we close?

246
00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:23.730
spencer-tb: Hey, I just wanted to, I guess.

247
00:41:24.010 --> 00:41:28.359
spencer-tb: Bring up a small, kind of, testing organizational question.

248
00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:34.590
spencer-tb: I guess mostly for EL client devs, and then also DevOps, so…

249
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.670
spencer-tb: I guess since last week, we have the new CFI EIPs.

250
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:42.110
spencer-tb: So the way I see it now is we kind of have

251
00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:52.989
spencer-tb: like, these free tracks going on for Amsterdam, and so the free pricing, block access lists, and then the new CFI VIPs. Last week,

252
00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:59.910
spencer-tb: We internally spoke in our testing meeting about how we want to do test releases, and…

253
00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:08.709
spencer-tb: Basically, we want to start working on the new CFI DIPs, the specs, and get some tests out, so I guess I just wanted to ask the question to…

254
00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:13.310
spencer-tb: EL clients prefer that we… and DevOps prefer that we, kind of…

255
00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:17.580
spencer-tb: test these new EIPs separately outside of block access lists?

256
00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.549
spencer-tb: I think, for us, that's what we prefer, so…

257
00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:24.520
spencer-tb: Just to throw the question out there.

258
00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:29.230
spencer-tb: I think we should have, these separate block access list test releases, and then

259
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:37.080
spencer-tb: maybe separate test releases with the new CFI DIPs, and that would… that would encompass all of the new CFI DIPs, if that makes sense?

260
00:42:37.390 --> 00:42:42.829
spencer-tb: Or if anyone has any better suggestions. Yeah, just throwing the question out there, just to…

261
00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:48.060
spencer-tb: See if we can, get Glamsteram tested as efficiently as possible.

262
00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.330
Mario Vega: Amazing. I think, yeah, Dragon?

263
00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:06.510
draganrakita: I don't have a preference here, but…

264
00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:11.380
draganrakita: It feels that clients are making good progress on the ball.

265
00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:16.090
draganrakita: So it seems okay to test all of them with the ball.

266
00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.060
draganrakita: But…

267
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:23.640
draganrakita: Yeah, because we are… when we are testing new IPs, we'll be testing a ball in the same place.

268
00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:30.680
draganrakita: So maybe it will be a little bit better, but yeah, seeing it again, I don't have a big preference here.

269
00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:48.959
draganrakita: In general, if there is no ball inside the state test, or blockchain test, oh, no, not state, but blockchain test, we will not create a compare ball at all. If there is ball, we will compare it.

270
00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.620
draganrakita: So either way works.

271
00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.909
Mario Vega: Got it, thank you.

272
00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:03.870
Mario Vega: I think the main question is how far ahead are decline teams? I don't think much, because we just decided this last week.

273
00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:27.640
Mario Vega: But yeah, the testing team, I think we can go either way. We can just make the releases on top of block-level access. In my opinion, maybe if we do this approach, it will expedite the testing, because if you are testing everything together, it's gonna end up faster in the DevNets, so maybe that's beneficial.

274
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.850
Mario Vega: So we could explore that, maybe,

275
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:47.330
Mario Vega: Alright, any comments from all the, all the other client teams on this?

276
00:44:48.110 --> 00:44:57.490
Mario Vega: If not, we can take this to the team, and maybe we can make a decision and update you guys async.

277
00:44:58.130 --> 00:45:00.429
Mario Vega: On, on the, on what we have decided.

278
00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:06.519
Mario Vega: Basically, just whether the EIPs and the block load access lists are separated or joined together.

279
00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:19.139
Mario Vega: And, yeah, just one comment. Seems simpler to test with access list, but that's your preference, yeah. Yeah, I personally would, would, lean…

280
00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:25.889
Mario Vega: towards putting the EIPs with the black glue accesses already, just to make sure that we are testing faster.

281
00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:28.399
Mario Vega: For the future devoids.

282
00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:40.059
Mario Vega: Makes sense. Okay, we will go with that approach. If there's,

283
00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:47.609
Mario Vega: And updates in the meantime, before next ICD, we can keep you guys updated on the async channels.

284
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:52.019
Mario Vega: Or if we find any issues, or if we have any problems with this approach.

285
00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.560
Mario Vega: Yeah, more comments supporting this. Okay, sounds good.

286
00:46:01.420 --> 00:46:03.310
Mario Vega: Alright, thanks for the input.

287
00:46:04.440 --> 00:46:06.040
Mario Vega: Alright, anything else?

288
00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.730
Mario Vega: That, anyone wants to share today, before we close up?

289
00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:33.559
Mario Vega: All right. If not, I think that's the end of the call. Thanks, everyone, for joining, and happy BP01 fork tomorrow, and see you in ACD on Thursday.

290
00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:36.840
Mario Vega: Bye. Thank you.

291
00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:37.920
Stefan Starflinger: Bye, alright.

292
00:46:38.590 --> 00:46:39.290
draganrakita: Mine.
