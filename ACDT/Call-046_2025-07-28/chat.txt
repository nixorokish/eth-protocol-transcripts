00:09:48	Manu:	Asking because Prysm orphaned a block and noticed that all columns were received very late (>7s) into the slot
00:10:45	pawan:	Are the orphaned blocks from a specific CL/EL ?
00:11:28	Manu:	Replying to "Are the orphaned blo..."

no
00:11:35	Manu:	Replying to "Are the orphaned blo..."

No clear pattern.

No clear pattern for the parent block as well

What’s your approach, are you creating some benchmarks for this?
00:32:55	Trent:	Catching up, the nethermind and geth issues are related or not related to 45mm?

00:45:05	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "How much do these fi..."

Yet to check tbh, we’re learning about this fs ability as we go
00:45:13	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "How much do these fi..."

But its sort of the only realistic way to do state tests at scale
00:45:26	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "How much do these fi..."

Moving tbs of state around will kill SSDs otherwise
00:45:38	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "How much do these fi..."

Eth price isn’t high enough for that
00:47:37	Ben Adams:	Replying to "How much do these fi..."

I don't think we should

already on the list 🚀

Calibrated Opcode Costs?
00:54:37	Roman:	@Louis can you remind pls how to interpret the y axis on your charts?
00:55:00	Louis:	Replying to "@Louis can you remin..."

It is the time spent on the benchmark test! In second
00:55:39	Roman:	Replying to "@Louis can you remin..."

is it in seconds?
00:55:58	Mario Vega:	Reacted to "is it in seconds?" with 👍🏼
00:56:10	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "is it in seconds?" with 👍🏼
00:57:08	danceratopz:	Replying to "@Louis can you remin..."

Yes, seconds. It's the time to execute the payload - a block that has been filled (to the specified gas limit) with the opcode being benchmarked.
