00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.470
Barnabas: Hello, everybody. Let's just give it another minute or two, then we can get started.

2
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:23.069
Barnabas: All right, good morning, everyone. Welcome to all Cordov's testing call number 70 on the 16th of February.

3
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.320
Barnabas: Let's get right into it.

4
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:37.060
Barnabas: Number one, on the agenda is, Steel Fusaka and, partial sales update, and I got Bob V3 implementation update.

5
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:45.550
Barnabas: Can we hear, an update from all the consensus layer clients, how they… what kind of progress they made in the past weeks?

6
00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:49.780
Barnabas: Whether they are ready to be onboarded on, Blob DevNet Zero?

7
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.419
Barnabas: Currently, we have Lighthouse and Prism.

8
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.049
Barnabas: close to ready. Maybe we have someone from TECU that they could give us an update?

9
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:22.920
Barnabas: Or Nimbus?

10
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:31.180
Dustin: Sure, yeah. LibP2P for us is pretty much ready, so…

11
00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.199
Dustin: Now we're trying to get in the rest, in, but that's… That was just,

12
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.140
Dustin: Last week, that, that… Got to a usable state.

13
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:52.220
Barnabas: Tldr is, we currently have…

14
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:59.450
Barnabas: about 20 notes, each of the notes, or half of the notes are super notes, half of the notes are full notes.

15
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:10.220
Barnabas: There's not that many validators, and I have latency added of 80 milliseconds between each of the nodes, and

16
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:18.240
Barnabas: the MEV node that is publishing the private blobs is limited to maximum of two peers.

17
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:26.699
Barnabas: So, here we are basically trying to mimic a very, very poorly performing network,

18
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:41.180
Barnabas: with added latency and multiple hops in order for us to be able to see the results of GitLab's history without having the GitLab V2 eagerly pushing all the GitLab information out.

19
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:51.650
Barnabas: This is not full pure gas, this is just a partial cells, our escape.

20
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:56.989
Barnabas: The four pages, I think that's still a research topic.

21
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:16.630
Barnabas: Anyway, I think we can do, like, a proper bigger test once we have onboarded more consensus layer clients. Hopefully, in the next week or two, we can onboard Teco and Nimbus.

22
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.859
Barnabas: Maybe a couple of weeks later, others as well?

23
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:27.039
Barnabas: Anyone else, would have client updates regarding, partial cell stuff?

24
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:43.670
Barnabas: Yeah, we can take a look at that offline. I haven't looked into the network, today yet.

25
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:55.489
Barnabas: If no more client updates, then maybe we can move on to Glamsterdam.

26
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.840
Barnabas: And block-level access list update.

27
00:08:59.230 --> 00:09:05.979
Barnabas: We had a couple of bugs, throughout the weekend. Stefan has reached out to all the clients regarding the specific bugs.

28
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:18.820
Barnabas: For now, we have reverted into a previous comment that was working. We currently have 100% participation, but hopefully those bugs can be fixed by the, reached out client.

29
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:24.940
Barnabas: Do we have any other, updates regarding local access list?

30
00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.700
Toni Wahrstätter: Yes, I have a short update.

31
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:31.700
Barnabas: Nope.

32
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:44.219
Toni Wahrstätter: In the last breakout call, we discussed, how we want to deal with a potential DOS vector. Basically, what happens if a malicious builder would fill the block lab access list with a lot of garbage storage reads.

33
00:09:44.750 --> 00:10:00.639
Toni Wahrstätter: And the easiest fix for that was basically to have a hard cap on the items in the block club access list. So this would be a hard cap that would not be limiting to block builders, because you would always first hit the gas limit before you hit

34
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:05.640
Toni Wahrstätter: the max… Ball item limit, so this is, like.

35
00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:10.579
Toni Wahrstätter: Only a safety guard against, against a malicious builder.

36
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.809
Toni Wahrstätter: I posted the PR, against the EAP into the agenda.

37
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.399
Barnabas: Yeah, I just, posted it here as well, in the chat.

38
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:29.809
Toni Wahrstätter: Perfect. Yeah, so if you look at it, there's one thing, so in the PR, I say gas available, but this should actually be the gas, limit, so I have to fix that.

39
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:41.620
Toni Wahrstätter: Also, one thing, in the current PR, we incorporate the max withdrawals and the max consolidation into the formula, which is not super clean, in my opinion, so…

40
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:51.230
Toni Wahrstätter: This is probably one of the things we want to discuss in the… we can discuss today or in the next breakout call, but essentially how we could simplify that formula.

41
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:54.969
Toni Wahrstätter: And… One important thing here is…

42
00:10:55.260 --> 00:11:03.339
Toni Wahrstätter: We currently assume that the minimum cost to have an item in the bowl is 2,000 gas, which comes from

43
00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:09.150
Toni Wahrstätter: Putting a storage key on the 2930 access list, and then accessing it.

44
00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:15.939
Toni Wahrstätter: Which costs another 100 guests, on top of the $1,900 that you pay for the access list, slot.

45
00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:26.029
Toni Wahrstätter: And this might be not needed anymore, or could be simplified if we go for EAP7981, which…

46
00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.699
Toni Wahrstätter: Adds a cost on top of the access lists.

47
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.790
Toni Wahrstätter: on the 2930 access lists makes them more expensive.

48
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:39.939
Toni Wahrstätter: Thus, the minimum cost to put an item onto the ball will increase for that.

49
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:43.810
Toni Wahrstätter: So there's probably some simplifications that will be done.

50
00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:55.129
Toni Wahrstätter: To this PR, I saw it was automatically merged by now, but, yeah, just as a heads up, I think clients have already implemented something, like this.

51
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:57.159
Toni Wahrstätter: But it will change.

52
00:11:57.330 --> 00:12:01.289
Toni Wahrstätter: This is nothing that will affect Definite 2 or Definite 3, I would say.

53
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:07.600
Toni Wahrstätter: We want to have that check, by definite free, so there will be tests ready by the time

54
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.559
Toni Wahrstätter: But yeah, just as a heads up that there will be some changes coming.

55
00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:20.449
Barnabas: Thank you. Anyone else has any other,

56
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:26.289
Barnabas: Changes, open questions that we still have to discuss regarding blocked access list?

57
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:34.290
Toni Wahrstätter: Maybe let me just add quick question. Marius, you're referring… is this question directed to me? Like, what is the max gas limit this could support?

58
00:12:34.290 --> 00:12:35.020
Marius van der Wijden: Yes.

59
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:46.530
Toni Wahrstätter: Okay, yeah, so the… yeah, the formula uses the gas limit, so it will just scale with the gas limit. Currently, the simplest approach would be you take the gas limit and you divide it by 2,000,

60
00:12:46.610 --> 00:13:01.059
Toni Wahrstätter: And this is then the maximum items we can have in the block of access list. Of course, there are some items that are for free. For example, state divs coming from withdrawals or consolidations, because no one pays for them, actually.

61
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:04.509
Toni Wahrstätter: So, those are currently subtracted in the formula.

62
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:11.500
Toni Wahrstätter: And, yeah, if someone has suggestions how to implement that, simply.

63
00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:17.169
Toni Wahrstätter: Without using those two constants, the max withdrawal and the max consolidation.

64
00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:25.749
Toni Wahrstätter: I'm open to hear them. But I would say the simplest would probably be we do something like gas limit divided by 2,000,

65
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:27.759
Toni Wahrstätter: And just cap it at that.

66
00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:29.730
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah.

67
00:13:30.630 --> 00:13:42.800
Toni Wahrstätter: Just to make sure that we're not limiting… the goal is to not introduce any new constraints, so the gas limit should be the only constraint here, and we don't want to create, like, a complicated situation for builders here.

68
00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:49.420
Barnabas: Right.

69
00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:56.720
Barnabas: What is the… what is the problem with using those values?

70
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:08.169
Toni Wahrstätter: In my opinion, it's just not super clean, because those values are defined in CL EAPs, so it's the max withdrawals of 16 and the max consolidations of 2.

71
00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:19.170
Toni Wahrstätter: And it will then always need updates in the future. Every time when we introduce new state changes from system contracts, we would also have to update this number.

72
00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.079
Toni Wahrstätter: and… Yeah, also if we…

73
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.910
Barnabas: Increase level.

74
00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:30.740
Toni Wahrstätter: I'm not sure, I'm not sure, but I would assume the simplest would just be to simplify

75
00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:32.480
Toni Wahrstätter: The formula.

76
00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:44.810
Toni Wahrstätter: By just not using those constants, and we should be fine too, because we don't… it's just for preventing DOS from an invalid block. So it's not like a super serious attack.

77
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.570
Toni Wahrstätter: But definitely something we have to,

78
00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.889
Toni Wahrstätter: We have to make sure that we are not, vulnerable.

79
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.060
Barnabas: Makes sense.

80
00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:20.130
Barnabas: I have some other comment, that it should be possible to construct a block, which violates this constraint, because then you will have invalid AVM execution.

81
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:24.060
Barnabas: Jason, do you want to also add something else?

82
00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.489
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, I just wanted to note it, because this constraint

83
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.220
jochem-brouwer: It's basically a check which you do on quickly invalidating the blocked over access list.

84
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:46.920
jochem-brouwer: But it should not be interpreted as, like, a constraint which should be checked in the EVM, because you cannot constrict such a block-level exit list.

85
00:15:54.630 --> 00:16:08.550
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, exactly. This will be something outside. When clients receive the block level access list over the engine API, this constraint can directly be enforced. So you would directly count how many items does the Block Love Access List have.

86
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:22.430
Toni Wahrstätter: And if the number of items is already unrealistic compared, with respect to the gas limit, then clients should invalidate the block immediately, without even starting execution. And this is why we need a

87
00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:28.319
Toni Wahrstätter: We need to agree on the formula here in order to make sure that all clients invalidate that block early.

88
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:39.649
Barnabas: Okay. Well, let's target to check this in the next DevNet, I think, and put it in the scope of DevNet Street.

89
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.200
Barnabas: Then there's one more open question regarding an execution API, question.

90
00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:51.269
Barnabas: Tony, maybe you can also give us an update regarding this, Pierre?

91
00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.110
Toni Wahrstätter: Yes, let me quickly pull it up.

92
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:08.780
Toni Wahrstätter: Okay, this was the… JSON RPC methods, right? The JSRPC methods were simplified, so…

93
00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:12.669
Toni Wahrstätter: We don't use by block number or by block.

94
00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.910
Toni Wahrstätter: hash?

95
00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.390
Toni Wahrstätter: Anymore?

96
00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:32.639
Toni Wahrstätter: No, sorry, we, we now use block number or tag, or hash in the JSON RPC. I saw from Karim and Barget that they already approved those changes.

97
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:42.489
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I think we have an agreement that we go for this. I already updated the description, the PR, so yeah, please have a look, and…

98
00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:51.630
Toni Wahrstätter: would be great to get those implemented for Definite 3. Also, one change compared to DEFNET2 would be that we don't return the…

99
00:17:51.920 --> 00:18:03.510
Toni Wahrstätter: RLP bytes in the response, because this is a user-facing method, so it would be great if we returned the JSON-encoded block of access list.

100
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:09.329
Toni Wahrstätter: And the PR, you link in the chat is already, up-to-date with that.

101
00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.990
Barnabas: Thank you.

102
00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:21.030
Barnabas: Does anyone else have… Anything to add to this, or the previous PR?

103
00:18:25.330 --> 00:18:34.250
Barnabas: In case not, maybe we can ask Eragon regarding their readiness for… Balled up into?

104
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:46.099
Andrew Ashikhmin: Right, so, yeah, we're getting closer, so I think it will still take us a few days. My estimation is that by the end of this week, we'll be ready.

105
00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:56.990
Barnabas: These, the EIPs, or the PRs that we were discussing today, are going to be scoped for the next DevNet.

106
00:18:57.270 --> 00:19:01.129
Barnabas: So you don't need to have these, to be onboarded for that material yet.

107
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:16.320
Andrew Ashikhmin: Right. So, and, the, is get block access list by hash and by number, the, the previous, the previous variant, is it also not part of DevNet2?

108
00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:23.070
Barnabas: No, like, it's… it doesn't really matter, because it's, no service is using this yet.

109
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:24.540
Barnabas: Okay.

110
00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:25.250
Andrew Ashikhmin: Excellent.

111
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:40.470
Andrew Ashikhmin: Okay, got it. Yes, so we are basically… we're working on… we have some draft implementation of everything, but there are still some test failures, so we are working on fixing those.

112
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:43.880
Barnabas: Great, thank you.

113
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:53.280
Barnabas: Would we have any other updates from CI clients that would want to be onboarded in October Access List DeW2?

114
00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:12.699
Barnabas: Doesn't sound like it. So maybe we can move on to the next topic.

115
00:20:12.810 --> 00:20:14.820
Barnabas: Which would be gas limit changes.

116
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:24.449
Barnabas: the ETH70 update, last week we launched a new DevNet called NFT DevNet 10, where we activated ETH70.

117
00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:28.259
Barnabas: Hmm… maybe someone from…

118
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.479
Barnabas: Oh, is that Marius, maybe? Can you give us an update, regarding how this network is going?

119
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:42.000
Marius van der Wijden: Sure. So, NFT DevNet 10 was launched, and it has some transactions that

120
00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:48.930
Marius van der Wijden: are not able, like, you cannot sync them anymore if you are Snap-syncing, because the receipts are too large.

121
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.850
Marius van der Wijden: And we have confirmed Netherland and Gath

122
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:59.319
Marius van der Wijden: Current masses are not able to sync the network, and with the ETH70, they are.

123
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:06.200
Marius van der Wijden: If you are a client that is trying to implement ETH70, you can just

124
00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:10.930
Marius van der Wijden: yeah, basically use NFT DevNet 10…

125
00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:15.840
Marius van der Wijden: In order to, verify that your client is able to…

126
00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:21.090
Marius van der Wijden: W.

127
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:29.690
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah, on Beto's side, I want to share the progress. I'm able to sync the network. I'm…

128
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:33.700
Fabio Di Fabio: with, externally, so I'm connecting to the DevNet.

129
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:41.489
Fabio Di Fabio: And I'm finalizing the code, so I can also join directly the DevNet.

130
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:48.590
Fabio Di Fabio: I think these, this week, middle of week, we should be able to… To join the network.

131
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:50.930
Marius van der Wijden: Very nice.

132
00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:05.389
Marius van der Wijden: I think, Wrath and Aragon are not… it's not super high on their priority list, because… they,

133
00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:10.769
Marius van der Wijden: Pull nodes, so they will sync everything anyway.

134
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:13.740
Marius van der Wijden: But…

135
00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:23.959
Marius van der Wijden: It would also be nice for them to serve ETH70. And also, ETH70 is now a prerequisite for ETH71.

136
00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:30.609
Marius van der Wijden: Eth71, adds a method to get block access lists.

137
00:22:31.110 --> 00:22:39.380
Marius van der Wijden: And, yes. So, if you want to be, spec compliant,

138
00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:46.729
Marius van der Wijden: Aragon and Wrath, you also should implement ETH70, and then ETH71 for, I think.

139
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:49.819
Marius van der Wijden: We decided to move it to Definite 3, right?

140
00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.810
Marius van der Wijden: Oh, definitely.

141
00:22:53.510 --> 00:22:54.730
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, exactly.

142
00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.810
FLCL: From Nethermine's side, we are testing.

143
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:19.549
FLCL: with, more corner cases. I see now that, either guest sense, nulls, or we, read it as,

144
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:27.790
FLCL: like, now a race, and block is empty, so I'm trying to figure out it now.

145
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:34.209
FLCL: And, we'll test, more pairs, like, synchronizing from

146
00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:38.770
FLCL: Another mind, another mind, guest another mind, and so on.

147
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.060
FLCL: Another thing is,

148
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:51.350
FLCL: Whether we should split packets… should split receipts that are not, like, very big, but still significant.

149
00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:58.890
FLCL: For now, I implemented it in such way that if

150
00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:07.880
FLCL: Something's bigger than one sort of, 10 megabytes,

151
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.290
FLCL: We can split it… split it… And, yeah.

152
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:30.920
Barnabas: Alright, so just to recap, for local accessories.f3, we're gonna be adding the, the EIP…

153
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:37.620
Barnabas: changes for, the DOS attack. We're gonna be adding the ETH71.

154
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:44.209
Barnabas: Where 870 is the, prerequisite, and we're gonna be adding the new,

155
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:48.339
Barnabas: RPC call, just an RPC call, that we just discussed.

156
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.579
Barnabas: Is there any other change that we expect for Plotin of Access List 3?

157
00:24:57.620 --> 00:25:10.539
Toni Wahrstätter: I don't think so. Don't think so. Only the optimizations, so we wanted to have all the optimizations for… I mean, this is independent from definite 3. We wanted to have them some… sometime between Definite 2 and Definite 3 to make sure that

158
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:13.319
Toni Wahrstätter: We can finish the benchmarking.

159
00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:18.669
Toni Wahrstätter: But apart from that, maybe the engine API methods, right? There are still the engine API methods.

160
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.480
Toni Wahrstätter: That are also in the scope for DevNet3.

161
00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:29.620
Barnabas: Yes, Fabio?

162
00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.140
Fabio Di Fabio: Yeah, I was, thinking about…

163
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:40.150
Fabio Di Fabio: having, both ETH70 and the ETH71 in the same,

164
00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:45.020
Fabio Di Fabio: bold DevNet 3, does it make sense to just use

165
00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:49.119
Fabio Di Fabio: Merge them together, and have only one…

166
00:25:49.230 --> 00:25:52.010
Fabio Di Fabio: new version of the P2P protocol.

167
00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:01.900
Fabio Di Fabio: It's not a big deal, just to avoid having… Double.

168
00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:09.359
Fabio Di Fabio: to just, deprecate, ETH70.

169
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.599
Fabio Di Fabio: As soon as we have TH71.

170
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:21.750
Barnabas: I think the idea was that ETH70 is, ready to be activated without any implied access list code.

171
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:27.670
Fabio Di Fabio: So, before Glamstadam, Okay, makes sense, yes.

172
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:44.860
Barnabas: Regarding timelines, hopefully we can launch the MS3 sometime next week.

173
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.340
Barnabas: Maybe middle of next week?

174
00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.540
Barnabas: Maybe 25th of February?

175
00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.270
Barnabas: Cette un pose a… Target?

176
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:02.720
Barnabas: Would everyone be okay with that?

177
00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:12.040
Marius van der Wijden: kind of depends on the other EIPs. If we want to add the other EIPs, I would…

178
00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.720
Marius van der Wijden: Probably… I think we would probably need a bit more time.

179
00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:22.630
Marius van der Wijden: If we just say, ETH71 and…

180
00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.799
Marius van der Wijden: And the diff… the changes to Bell.

181
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.509
Marius van der Wijden: Then I think next week should be fine for us.

182
00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:32.850
Barnabas: Alright,

183
00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:41.949
Barnabas: Regarding the scope, I completely missed last week's all core devs call. What was the decision there? Which EIPs would be making it into DevNet Street?

184
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.530
Barnabas: Okay.

185
00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.740
Barnabas: So the… was that the one?

186
00:27:57.460 --> 00:28:04.120
Toni Wahrstätter: If I remember correctly, there was 8037 and another one. I forgot which one it was now.

187
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, as Maria's saying, the, contract says one,

188
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:30.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: Exactly. 7954. And then I think, if I can remember correctly, that one, though, I would double-check with people, is that we hadn't made a call yet whether, possibly, we already have E70, E71 ready. I think that one we just wanted to see.

189
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:31.820
Ansgar Dietrichs: Right?

190
00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.480
Barnabas: Yeah, that sounds good. Ben?

191
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:47.369
Ben Adams: There were a few EIP adjustments as well, like… Changing how… Was it swap-in work?

192
00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.710
Ben Adams: Which I think need to be.

193
00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.839
Ben Adams: scheduled to the change on the fly.

194
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.680
Barnabas: Perfect. Would you have a PR for that?

195
00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:06.570
Ben Adams: I think it was a comment on the last… I see the… I'm not sure.

196
00:29:07.020 --> 00:29:18.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: And yes, sorry, I wasn't aware that I should look into this before this call, but from my memory, I think there was one suggestion at which that was actually rejected, and the other one was just put up for discussion, so I don't think it was decided yet.

197
00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:23.080
Ansgar Dietrichs: It's my understanding, but… Maybe I misremember.

198
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:30.290
Barnabas: Yeah, I can… I can dig that up after the call and, put together a…

199
00:29:30.560 --> 00:29:33.869
Barnabas: spec sheet for the next 3. And then we can,

200
00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:38.340
Barnabas: Maybe discuss timelines for, on this next week.

201
00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:48.329
Barnabas: Let's… let's just try to have everything implemented, 1837 and 7954, and, deeds 17 and 71 as well.

202
00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:57.259
Barnabas: And then, let's see if we can still, keep the target date next week, Wednesday. And if it's too tight, then, we just push it maybe a week.

203
00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.290
Barnabas: to the first week of March.

204
00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:03.870
Barnabas: If that sounds good.

205
00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:28.190
Barnabas: Mario, would you like to share your concern?

206
00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:34.560
Mario Vega: Yeah, I mean, it's… it seems like an easy change, but do we still have to refill the tests with the…

207
00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.270
Mario Vega: 8037?

208
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:47.570
Mario Vega: To be honest, I'm out of the loop on the status of this, in terms of tests, so I will have to check with the team to see if we have done any meaningful progress.

209
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:50.759
Mario Vega: But yeah, I'm still concerned.

210
00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.469
Barnabas: Okay, does that mean that you would prefer to… yeah, Spencer?

211
00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:04.759
spencer-tb: Yeah, sorry, so, we have, like, a specs PR up for 8037, no tests yet, so I do…

212
00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:09.819
spencer-tb: share the same concern as Mario, and I think there are some kind of small…

213
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:15.370
spencer-tb: spec changes that might be needed for some EIP interactions, so I think

214
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:19.950
spencer-tb: Maybe I can comment, or,

215
00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:30.349
spencer-tb: start a thread in Discord with, some of these potential spec changes, or even create PR, and then we can get movement there. But yeah, I do share similar, concerns with Mario.

216
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:32.960
spencer-tb: And just, yeah, because we haven't got tests yet.

217
00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:40.529
Barnabas: Right, would you guys prefer if we just push AD37 outside of the scope of this?

218
00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:56.620
Mario Vega: I don't want to push anything out of scope that was decided on ICD. I think we can start, like, pushing for the tests. I mean, the most concerning part is that,

219
00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:59.559
Mario Vega: So, some tests are definitely gonna break.

220
00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:06.260
Mario Vega: I mean, what… we can… we can assess whether it's too many, and just,

221
00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:13.539
Mario Vega: take them off the release, for example, that could be one possibility. So we only fill the tests that don't… do not break, and we can,

222
00:32:13.750 --> 00:32:17.919
Mario Vega: run, make a release for the clients to consume, for the tree.

223
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:21.699
Mario Vega: But still, it feels a little bit rushed to me, in my opinion, yeah.

224
00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:23.690
Mario Vega: Yep.

225
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:34.209
Barnabas: Yeah, so Marius' suggestion would be to push it to the first week of March, or remove the EIP.

226
00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:40.839
Barnabas: I would just say that let's try to aim for the 4th of March instead of the 25th of February.

227
00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:43.149
Barnabas: And try to ship everything.

228
00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:50.019
Barnabas: Would that… Make it better for the testing team as well?

229
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.540
Mario Vega: Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

230
00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.770
Barnabas: Thank you.

231
00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:08.670
Barnabas: Regarding another… was it simulate V1, so we would want to have it simulate,

232
00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:13.909
Barnabas: Just an appreciated to every single EL client by Divino Street as well.

233
00:33:15.170 --> 00:33:20.440
Barnabas: Hopefully, this can also be done. Obviously, that's not a breaking request, but…

234
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:26.020
Barnabas: It's something that's gonna really help us, do some benchmarking.

235
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.330
Barnabas: So, please try to get that done as well.

236
00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:46.489
Barnabas: And, yeah, Ansgar also mentioned that if 70 would be part of Dentistry, where clients can still support it, or they can still participate even without supporting the protocol.

237
00:33:47.050 --> 00:33:48.420
Barnabas: So, yeah.

238
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:51.610
Barnabas: I mean, we don't have to stress test, basically.

239
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:58.719
Barnabas: those big receipts on, Business 3. I think we have a dedicated network for that, that's good enough.

240
00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:09.449
Barnabas: I think 871, Mmm… Last time I checked, I think guest also didn't have its limit.

241
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.840
Barnabas: But I can… I can double-check it, Marius.

242
00:34:14.989 --> 00:34:20.479
Barnabas: There was the daily hive test that's running to test for these endpoints.

243
00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:32.480
Barnabas: Yeah, I can… I can get back to that, mars.

244
00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:39.690
Barnabas: Regarding implementing 871, whether we want this in demonstrope or not.

245
00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:42.370
Barnabas: What is the ER's take on this?

246
00:34:53.170 --> 00:34:54.219
Marius van der Wijden: Sorry, Egan?

247
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:59.739
Barnabas: Would you guys prefer to have it 71 in the scope of DevNet Street?

248
00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:14.280
Marius van der Wijden: I don't know, it depends on… I think it kind of depends on the clients that have not implemented ETH70 yet, because they will have

249
00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:15.950
Marius van der Wijden: To do much more.

250
00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:17.030
Marius van der Wijden: work.

251
00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:27.319
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, I would prefer if 71 to be postponed, because, yeah, it will be too much to implement both.

252
00:35:30.230 --> 00:35:30.740
Barnabas: Annuity.

253
00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:32.540
Andrew Ashikhmin: We have everything done before.

254
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:42.770
Barnabas: Yeah, so it's RESH and Eragon, right, that have not yet implemented E70. Anyone from RESH can also comment on it?

255
00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:50.899
Jen: Yeah, I think we provided an image. Let me get back to you. I don't see any blockers for Y70 for us.

256
00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.250
Barnabas: Right. Okay.

257
00:35:54.180 --> 00:36:01.660
Barnabas: So if it's only Aragon, then I would actually suggest that we keep it in the scope of DevNet 3.

258
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:07.610
Barnabas: And, possibly launch without Eragon, for the next 3 as well, and then,

259
00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:17.109
Barnabas: previously have 4 clients at Genesis time, and then we can add everyone down the line when the implementation for them is complete as well.

260
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:24.020
Karim T. (matkt): Well, just on the Bizu side, we have it, but for the moment, we are not passing half tests, so…

261
00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:30.309
Karim T. (matkt): I don't know if we have the complete implementation, or if we need to add some fixes.

262
00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:32.679
Karim T. (matkt): But yeah, just wanted to share that.

263
00:36:38.380 --> 00:36:45.959
Ben Adams: Aragons, fine for sinking, aren't they? Because they don't actually care about the receipt. It's just for serving. That would be the problem.

264
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:46.960
Ben Adams: Is that correct?

265
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:51.169
Barnabas: Right, but that's for 870. We are not talking about 871.

266
00:36:51.610 --> 00:36:52.129
Ben Adams: Oh, sure, sure.

267
00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:54.500
Barnabas: Oh wait, that's also optional.

268
00:36:55.440 --> 00:37:07.120
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, it's… ETH71 is… is… provides the way of, like, querying dials from other nodes, and that is only used for sync improvements, right, Tony?

269
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.520
Toni Wahrstätter: Yes, exactly. So, we might not need it, but definitely, I guess.

270
00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:16.640
Marius van der Wijden: Then it's optional.

271
00:37:17.230 --> 00:37:17.970
Barnabas: somewhere.

272
00:37:18.110 --> 00:37:24.579
Barnabas: Then we're gonna put it in the optional bucket, and then whoever, implements it is good, and whoever's not.

273
00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:25.470
Barnabas: Not.

274
00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:29.019
Barnabas: So that's… Let's keep it at that.

275
00:37:31.450 --> 00:37:35.799
Barnabas: Okay, anything else regarding local access list?

276
00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:47.230
Barnabas: If not, then maybe we can move on to the sales side, EPBS or not.

277
00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:53.580
Barnabas: Do we have any client updates from… Any sales teams?

278
00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.719
Stefan Bratanov: I can speak from Techo.

279
00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.209
Stefan Bratanov: Making a little bit of progress.

280
00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.759
Stefan Bratanov: So we implemented the Beacon API for the execution payload.

281
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:16.429
Stefan Bratanov: But at the moment, we don't support finalized retrieval of execution payloads.

282
00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.659
Stefan Bratanov: So I guess for DemNet0, that'll be good, so that nodes can sync.

283
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:26.219
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, I'm making progress, but still not there yet.

284
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.429
Barnabas: When would you expect the code to be ready?

285
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:42.139
Stefan Bratanov: Maybe we can have some version in the next couple of weeks, I guess.

286
00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:53.020
Stefan Bratanov: And then polish it from there. But, yeah, maybe in the next call, the next testing call, I'll be able to provide better…

287
00:38:53.530 --> 00:38:55.339
Stefan Bratanov: Timeline for that?

288
00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.240
Barnabas: Nope.

289
00:38:59.190 --> 00:39:06.130
Barnabas: Yeah, because the original idea was to have our desktop by mid-February, which is basically in two days.

290
00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:09.139
Barnabas: So that is probably not reasonable for Taku.

291
00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:17.880
Stefan Bratanov: I don't think so. Well, we can have some cock version, but I would like something more complete, so…

292
00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:20.819
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, I think it'll be another week, at least.

293
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:22.130
Barnabas: Okay.

294
00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:25.199
Barnabas: Anyone from prison?

295
00:39:37.150 --> 00:39:38.390
Barnabas: Or lighthouse?

296
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:48.129
Gaia: Yeah, for Lighthouse, we have a DevNet Zero branch that we've been testing locally in, like, a Lighthouse-only Kurtosis network.

297
00:39:48.350 --> 00:39:52.760
Gaia: we're working through some bugs. I think we got block production working, but…

298
00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.139
Gaia: Somewhere along the lines of, gossip envelope processing and importing, there's a bug.

299
00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:08.910
Gaia: So we're working on fixing that, and we're hoping by the end of the week, we'll be ready to, like, interop locally with another client, maybe, like, Consensor or something.

300
00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:13.259
Gaia: But yeah, I don't think we'll be ready for February 18th either.

301
00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.939
Barnabas: Okay, thank you. Nimbus?

302
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:34.760
Dustin: Sure. So, I… we have, I mean, Alpha 2 specs, we have block broadcasting, we have most things where

303
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:48.800
Dustin: starting to work on a fork twice, I know that's not, sort of, super high priority for this, but envelope… the, sort of, the frontier for us right now is really, the envelope… things like envelope syncing. So yeah,

304
00:40:48.910 --> 00:40:56.309
Dustin: Yeah, the gossip stuff we should have, but this is now things like the, sinking, and if the…

305
00:40:57.870 --> 00:41:02.880
Dustin: Backfilling, sort of, of it, when we… when we miss one.

306
00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:13.039
Dustin: through RecRISP, things like this. So, that's… Yeah, I would say, yeah, not…

307
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:19.169
Dustin: Two days for… two or three days, yeah, not… not gonna, happen.

308
00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.830
Dustin: But… Yeah, well…

309
00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:32.220
Dustin: I mean, the other thing is that we have been trying to, test on kurtosis and running into, some of the same,

310
00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:42.440
Dustin: sort of issues that other clients have reported. I've linked this in a couple places, and I know the steel, the AllCL steel, steel channel.

311
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:46.830
Dustin: So, yeah, and we…

312
00:41:47.380 --> 00:42:01.969
Dustin: well, I say we, I… it was… this would be… Caleb, I guess, would be the one who's been… who has tried this since, and I don't know what the outcome was, but I know that it was, a little challenging. We were kind of blocked in proceeding to find out

313
00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:08.589
Dustin: how far we… how well it worked, because it just ran into some of the issues on the EL,

314
00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.379
Dustin: Sort of mock side.

315
00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.960
Dustin: That was earlier today.

316
00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:16.500
Barnabas: That should be fixed, no, I think.

317
00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:17.880
Dustin: Okay.

318
00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.800
Dustin: Yep.

319
00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.470
Barnabas: Thank you.

320
00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.040
Barnabas: Luther?

321
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:36.979
nflaig: So we are having fork Choice, fully implemented, but still needs to be merged. There are a few, outstanding PRs we need to merge.

322
00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:51.459
nflaig: But once that's done, the main part that's missing is just wiring everything up, so the block import works, which will be the major work still left. Yeah. I think we'll also need more than two days for that.

323
00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:53.729
nflaig: It's probably 1 or 2 weeks.

324
00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:56.880
Barnabas: Brendan?

325
00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:07.759
Barnabas: Nobody from grinding around.

326
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:09.890
Barnabas: Nobody from prison, I guess?

327
00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:30.579
Barnabas: Okay, anybody else has anything else to add, to EPPS.0?

328
00:43:37.010 --> 00:43:40.710
Barnabas: Now, this morning, I was actually able to get a consensor

329
00:43:40.910 --> 00:43:44.640
Barnabas: To pass all the tests and, able to…

330
00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:51.479
Barnabas: do the epoch transition into glass without any balls, just the APBS stuff.

331
00:43:52.870 --> 00:44:00.710
Barnabas: Yeah, it's a very unperforming Python client that I webcoded, and are this working?

332
00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:06.919
Barnabas: Also, it cannot appear to any other normal client, so it's not really production ready.

333
00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:10.170
Barnabas: Oh, yeah.

334
00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.760
Barnabas: Next topic would be stable out.

335
00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:20.780
Barnabas: Regarding Perf. Is anyone on the call regarding that?

336
00:44:26.610 --> 00:44:30.859
Barnabas: I know Netherland had a database issue.

337
00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.790
Barnabas: Maybe we can get an update on the latest.

338
00:44:38.230 --> 00:44:41.160
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I think the network is dead right now, right?

339
00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.240
Marius van der Wijden: At least that was my, my last,

340
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:52.090
Marius van der Wijden: last, what I read is basically… All clients…

341
00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:55.530
Marius van der Wijden: died, but never mind made it the furthest.

342
00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:06.890
Marius van der Wijden: And, so now NetherMind also died, and we have a chain that is finalized, where we don't have the blocks anymore, because no EL client was able to keep up.

343
00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:14.409
Marius van der Wijden: And, now the only way of doing that is, to basically re-og the chain.

344
00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:17.269
Marius van der Wijden: And, create a new consensus layer.

345
00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:20.729
Marius van der Wijden: Otherwise, we would have to unfinalize something.

346
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:23.640
Barnabas: Right.

347
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:30.959
Barnabas: Let's discuss this offline then. I think we might need to do a relaunch of the CL chain then.

348
00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:34.930
Marius van der Wijden: Yep.

349
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:40.690
Barnabas: Okay, that was the agenda for today.

350
00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.680
Barnabas: Unless anyone else has anything else to add?

351
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:47.539
Barnabas: I can call it a bit early today.

352
00:45:54.350 --> 00:45:55.390
Marius van der Wijden: Take care, y'all.

353
00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:58.840
Barnabas: Thanks, everyone, for coming.

354
00:45:59.410 --> 00:46:00.510
Barnabas: See you all next week.

355
00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.340
Mario Vega: Thank you, bye.

356
00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:05.340
Toni Wahrstätter: Thank you, bye-bye.
