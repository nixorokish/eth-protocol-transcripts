00:06:44	Marius van der Wijden:	Whats the tldr on blob-devnet-0?
00:07:35	Marius van der Wijden:	And the purpose is to test full peerdas?
00:08:29	Marius van der Wijden:	Seeign some orphans and 90% participation
00:09:47	Barnabas:	https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/11234
00:10:24	Marius van der Wijden:	Whats the max gas limit this could support?
00:12:46	Marius van der Wijden:	Ah okay
00:12:48	Marius van der Wijden:	cool
00:13:07	Marius van der Wijden:	(github doesn't load for me atm)
00:14:15	Dustin:	https://www.githubstatus.com/ says "All Systems Operational"
00:15:03	jochem-brouwer:	It should not be possible to construct a block which violates this constraint (because then you have invalid EVM execution) given that the formula is correct. So if we make this part of consensus then there should thus be tests of specifically sized BALs with items to test that invalidaton

00:20:49	Barnabas:	https://dora.nft-devnet-10.ethpandaops.io
00:21:20	Barnabas:	try to sync with kurtosis —  network: nft-devnet-10
00:22:23	jochem-brouwer:	Also need eth/71
00:22:24	jochem-brouwer:	Yes =)
00:24:59	Karim T. (matkt):	Protection against DOS attack will depend on result regarding prefetch no ?
00:25:30	Mario Vega:	Which Engine API methods?
00:25:33	Jen:	What’s the timeline for devnet-3?
00:25:45	Jen:	Replying to "Which Engine API met..."

https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/726 I believe
00:25:45	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Which Engine API met..."

one sec, I'll pull up the PR

00:27:45	Toni Wahrstätter:	8037 was scoped
00:27:55	Toni Wahrstätter:	and another one iirc
00:28:00	Dustin:	there's no https://notes.ethereum.org/@ethpandaops/bal-devnet-3 yet?
00:28:01	Maria Silva:	The contract size
00:28:09	Barnabas:	Replying to "there's no https://n..."

will make it right after the call
00:28:11	g1:	devnet-3
- EIP-8037: State Creation Gas Cost Increase

00:30:17	Mario Vega:	My main concern is 8037 on the testing side
00:30:23	Ben Adams:	Was this one https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/11306
00:30:51	Karim T. (matkt):	Is it devnet3 and devnet2 at the same time ? We wanted to do benchmark on devnet 2
00:30:54	Ansgar Dietrichs:	there was also `eth_simulateV1` RPC support
00:31:36	Marius van der Wijden:	Can we either 
1) push devnet-3 to first week of march
2) remove new eips (8037 and 7954) from devnet-3
00:31:53	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "Can we either 
1) ..."

I would prefer to move the deadline
00:31:53	Ansgar Dietrichs:	from the ACDE summary (looks right):

eth/70 part of devnet-3 spec; clients without support can still participate
00:32:12	Dustin:	Replying to "Is it devnet3 and ..."

would this mean supporting devnet-2 specs at the same time as devnet-3? these inevitably involve pointless back/forward porting of the same things to keep known-obsolete spec-based devnets running

00:33:59	felix (eest):	Reacted to "I would prefer to ..." with 👍
00:33:59	Marius van der Wijden:	Which client does not have eth_simulateV1 at this point?
00:34:35	Marius van der Wijden:	We have it in the codebase at least
00:35:05	Jen:	Reacted to "from the ACDE summar..." with 👍
00:35:31	Karim T. (matkt):	We have it in besu but not passing test, so maybe better to postpone also
00:35:47	Marius van der Wijden:	Reacted to "We have it in besu..." with 👍
00:36:49	Marius van der Wijden:	eth/71 is also optional (only used for sync improvements, which no one has iimpl yet)

00:40:04	Barnabas:	epbs-devnet-0  branch name?
