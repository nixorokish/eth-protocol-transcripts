spec sheet for all the EIPs that we are talking about
00:17:50	Stefan Starflinger:	we have lodestar and lighthouse CLs now
00:17:58	Stefan Starflinger:	I'm not sure about lighthouse internals regarding this

would be good to have this merged
00:18:44	Mario Vega:	https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1882#issuecomment-3798678466
00:19:58	Barnabas:	there are 4 EIPs not 3 Marius
00:20:13	Stefan Starflinger:	5 with BAL
00:20:35	Marius van der Wijden:	Oh we might not have the receipt one
00:20:52	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Oh we might not have..." 

 7778?
00:21:10	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "Oh we might not have..." 

 If so, the receipt field may be removed anyway
00:25:01	Barnabas:	wednesday last week lol

00:26:27	Stefan Starflinger:	Since the full suite takes too long to run daily, we have created a bal-quick hive suite with only the new EIPs https://hive.ethpandaops.io/#/group/bal-quick
00:26:48	Stefan Starflinger:	I've switched the bal hive tests to manual and the bal-quick to daily

Yeah I'm more interested in the right answer than what is easier to implement
00:31:57	Stefan Starflinger:	We whould have 3 clients with 7778 ready without changes to the spec then?
00:34:17	Dragan Rakita:	If this is true (you can’t get this info unless re execute), than storing it makes sense.

00:42:46	Barnabas:	@James He is the beacon api question devnet 0 critical?
00:43:43	nflaig:	@Barnabas not really, clients can implement whatever works now, we are not running mixed client setups for now I'd assume
00:43:52	James He:	@Barnabas I don’t think so I think we are going with the 2 step process for devnet 0
00:44:07	Justin Traglia:	Could we try to launch epbs-devnet-0 in ~10 days? I don’t feel comfortable freezing specs for devnet-1 before launching devnet-0.
00:44:13	James He:	Btw I assume people won’t have the ptc stuff for devnet 0 right?
00:44:28	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "Could we try to laun..."

With one or two clients.
00:45:01	James He:	Do we also have the new updated timelines for other stuff like attestations etc for devnet 0 or do we have the original timelines for devnet 0?
00:45:22	Toni Wahrstätter:	Reacted to Then lets make the c... with "👍"
00:45:29	James He:	Or is there a list of assumptions for devnet 0?

happens all the time haha
00:46:46	Eitan:	Replying to "Could we try to laun…"
fwiw it’ll be a stretch for LH to be ready for a devnet in 10 days. A more realistic target for us is mid to end feb
00:47:13	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "@Toni could you writ..."

00:47:16	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "Could we try to laun..."

Hmm okay. According to ethpandaops, the goal is Feb 18th for devnet-0.
00:47:27	Barnabas:	lets push this beacon api changes to devnet 1 scope, so that clients can ship faster.
00:47:33	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "@Toni could you writ..." 

 Oh yeah! 👍🏼
00:47:39	James He:	Replying to "Or is there a list o..."

Right, I guess 7732 is probably too big to have everything by devnet 0 ( or are people aiming to have everything) I thought we wanted to do it more incrementally such as not having the ptc voting as part of devote 0
00:47:47	Eitan:	Reacted to "Hmm okay. According …" with 👍
00:47:48	Mario Vega:	Replying to "Then lets make the c..."

We’ll prepare a tests release asap
00:48:27	Dustin:	Nimbus doesn't care about the exact timeline of when the beacon API changes go in; we're using pure-BN (no separate VC) for devnet-0
00:48:46	nflaig:	https://github.com/ethereum/beacon-APIs/pull/552
00:48:50	NC:	I brought up the fork choice issue couple weeks ago https://discord.com/channels/595666850260713488/874767108809031740/1458127259549437992 . Sounds like it doesn’t require synchronization @Dustin

00:53:58	Dustin:	generically the concern is that it modifies in-production Electra/Fulu
00:54:22	Dustin:	the question isn't whether its "tiny", it's whether it can cause consensus risks
00:54:50	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "the question isn't w..."

I’m not sure that it can cause consensus issues
00:55:01	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "the question isn't w..."

But Francesco isn’t here to give you a better answer
00:56:31	Dustin:	ok, if there are no consensus issues, it's fine
00:56:48	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "ok, if there are no ..."

Let’s double check with Francesco. I’ll make a thread.
00:57:09	Justin Traglia:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/issues/4858
00:57:37	Barnabas:	alpha 2 is aimed for epbs-devnet-1

01:01:25	Ansgar Dietrichs:	EIPs proposed for inclusion in the next devnet should be posted to the ACD-T agenda ahead of time

Decisions around CFI -> SFI or CFI -> DFI will not be discussed in ACD-T and should remain within ACD-E, ACD-C

Is a devnet inclusion decision not basically an SFI decision?
01:02:18	Ameziane Hamlat:	Reacted to "EIPs proposed for in..." with ➕
01:02:19	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "EIPs proposed for in..."

or rather, if we end up not SFI-ing an EIP after it was included in a devnet, that was wasted effort
01:02:51	Toni Wahrstätter:	Reacted to EIPs proposed for in... with "➕"
01:03:26	Barnabas:	EOF was SFI-ed it can still be pulled out
01:03:59	Toni Wahrstätter:	Clients provided great rankings and cfi'd eips should j just be included in the order based on how much support they gained.
01:04:05	Barnabas:	CFI = have impl.
01:04:31	Dustin:	Replying to "EOF was SFI-ed it ..."

I mostly take the whole EOF saga as an indication that it was SFI'd prematurely. Of course that might otherwise happen, but it shouldn't be routine
01:05:22	Jen:	Reacted to "CFI = have impl." with 👍
01:05:28	Ansgar Dietrichs:	I think it’s fine to make devnet decisions here on acdt, now that everyone is aware to pay attention here. just ideally have it clearly on the agenda ahead of time

01:05:58	felix (eest):	Reacted to "I think it’s fine..." with 👍
01:06:24	Barnabas:	if we don’t want an EIP in the protocol it shoudln’t even be cfi-ed lmao
01:06:34	Stefan Starflinger:	A spec is never really finished until we have a working implementation
01:06:48	wolovim:	Reacted to "I think it’s fine to..." with 👍
01:06:54	Stefan Starflinger:	we shouldn't SFI a Spec we should SFI a spec + implementation
01:06:58	Ansgar Dietrichs:	and what’s the general connection between implementation and devnet? are there usually any implementations before devnet inclusion? how easy is it to pull individual EIPs back out of a devnet?
01:07:13	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "if we don’t want an ..." 

 That's what you might think
01:07:29	wolovim:	psa: iterating on devnet decision making aid here: https://forkcast.org/devnets. Feedback/feature requests welcome.
01:07:33	Dustin:	it's also how intertwined it is
01:07:57	Justin Florentine (Besu):	and testing impact
01:08:22	Toni Wahrstätter:	What is the conclusion now?
01:08:29	Ansgar Dietrichs:	and (sorry last question) would it be too bureaucratic to have an initial decision on a devnet scope, but then a week later on the next acdt make a go-no go decision? that way clients would have a week to look at the selected EIPs and start implementation
01:08:45	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "and (sorry last ques..."

so we could catch EIPs that are more complex than expected
01:09:18	Dustin:	but mostly CLs don't all have the same per-EIP modularity as ELs might have
01:09:30	Dustin:	where they can be often granularly enabled/disabled
01:09:57	Toni Wahrstätter:	How did we get to the 4 eips that are now added to devnet 2? Not opposed to any of them but would be good to have a clear process

steel proposed as easy eips to have test cases out for
01:11:15	Dragan Rakita:	In general I would really like for ACD to have a async decision making (with deadlines) this live process is chaotic.
01:11:25	Barnabas:	Replying to "How did we get to th..."

we asked ppl on acdt if anyone had any issues having these for the next devnet, no objections, so this is what we set out as a goal

01:11:56	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "In general I would r..."

you mean ACDT now or ACDC/E or all of the above?
01:12:02	Toni Wahrstätter:	Replying to "How did we get to th..." 

 Ok, if that's the process I'm fine with it. Doesn't need to be formalized. I trust testing and devops to have a good feeling for it. Still, the level of support should also matter.

anyway, dropping off for now. a conversation that we should continue
