00:14:19	Barnabas:	Replying to "Did someone figure o..."

I’d assume underpowered supernodes
00:14:42	Barnabas:	Replying to "Did someone figure o..."

Its very likely that people are over-provisioning machines for holesky to leave the costs low
00:14:59	Barnabas:	Replying to "Did someone figure o..."

Duties of supernodes have increased compared to pectra duties
00:17:55	Barnabas:	I’d have assumed that all client switch at the fork boundry
00:17:55	James He:	I think we used at the fork but will double check
00:18:06	nflaig:	we switch at fork boundary
00:18:13	Barnabas:	What does lh do?
00:19:25	Barnabas:	We don’t have a working relay/builder on holesky now
00:19:33	Barnabas:	We expect them to be working on sepolia/hoodi tho

This is what Bharath replied to jimmy’s question
00:20:03	Barnabas:	Also reminder, holesky is officially EOL end of this month!
00:20:45	Barnabas:	We have recovered.
00:20:47	Barnabas:	Sorry can’t really talk
00:21:24	Barnabas:	We noticed that some nodes have ran out of disk again :/
00:21:40	Barnabas:	so we need a round of maintenance

yeah i saw this post on X and followed him, we can get some high quality feedback and ideas from him
00:36:53	Barnabas:	Its in their critical path to implement it.
00:37:13	Barnabas:	If they won’t implement it, clients should fall back to using another relay no?
00:37:29	pawan:	No we have already signed the block by that point
00:37:35	Justin Traglia:	Reacted to "No we have already s..." with 👍
00:38:10	pawan:	Can we just check with all clients how they implement it? We can switch to the common behaviour if required too just to be consistent
