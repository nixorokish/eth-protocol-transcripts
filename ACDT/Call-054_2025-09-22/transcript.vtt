00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.140
Akash | ECH: Hello.

2
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.120
Barnabas: No.

3
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.430
Akash | ECH: Hey, Barnabas, I'm helping with the stream today, so let me know whenever you are ready.

4
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.040
Barnabas: Sounds good.

5
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.320
Akash | ECH: chemical.

6
00:04:21.089 --> 00:04:25.689
Barnabas: Hi, everyone. Let's give it another minute or two, and then we can get started.

7
00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:04.379
Barnabas: Okay, let's get started. Josh, can you please start us through?

8
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.930
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are live.

9
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.520
Barnabas: Hi, everyone. Welcome to Accord Devs Testing Quad, number 54.

10
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:24.550
Barnabas: Let's get right into it. Last week, in the end of the week, we shut up, physical.net 5. We had a successful,

11
00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.949
Barnabas: Devnap, we were able to…

12
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:34.230
Barnabas: come up with the BPO numbers that we would like to use in the future testnets.

13
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.020
Barnabas: And, the following PRs were also raised.

14
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.449
Barnabas: Let me just… Put them in the chat here.

15
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:51.939
Barnabas: So we have, both key scheduled for next week, then the first BPO a week after that, second BPO a week after that.

16
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.099
Barnabas: And then a week after that,

17
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.970
Barnabas: And the day after that, we have, Separia.

18
00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.290
Barnabas: After the second BPO.

19
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:12.120
Barnabas: I saw that some client teams already started making, PRs into their client code, so I guess the config values that I've come up with are correct.

20
00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.199
Barnabas: Anyone has any comments regarding any of the config values?

21
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:35.800
Barnabas: There's also the fork IDs that have been, proposed by Bezu, and, Netherlands seem to have agreed on those.

22
00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.190
Barnabas: Oh, that's also good.

23
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.729
Barnabas: Yep, regarding, isn't that tree?

24
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:59.770
Barnabas: Demetri is currently at 97% participation. We have a couple of,

25
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.639
Barnabas: peers that are struggling, Deku, Aragon, Deku Nethermind, and Lighthouse and Busia.

26
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:11.700
Barnabas: Deku, Aragon, there seems to be possibly an ER bug.

27
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.970
Barnabas: Wait, never mind, there was also… seemed to be an ER bug,

28
00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:21.380
Barnabas: Maybe someone from the measurement team can give us an update?

29
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:31.310
FLCL: Yep, hello. So… We have some… Gas mismatch?

30
00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:35.949
FLCL: For some reason, we are still trying to figure out it.

31
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:46.410
FLCL: we ran some even older blocks and found another TX with the same problem, so… Well…

32
00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.760
FLCL: I hope it will be resolved in a day or two.

33
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:57.819
Barnabas: Is there a reason that other, NetherMind nodes are not stuck with the same, block?

34
00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.289
FLCL: No idea about it.

35
00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:16.050
Barnabas: Yeah, that's very interesting. Anyone from the Ergon team can also chime in?

36
00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:19.469
milen | Erigon: Yeah, hi, do you hear me okay?

37
00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.150
Barnabas: Yep.

38
00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:27.100
milen | Erigon: Yeah, hey, so, yeah, it seems like this node… I had a look, it seems like this…

39
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:44.519
milen | Erigon: node go in some weird state, and it's taking a very long time to do database commits. So I'm not… I haven't narrowed down why yet, but it could be due to, like, some disk issues on the server, or…

40
00:08:44.590 --> 00:08:52.460
milen | Erigon: Maybe just the node itself, has been struggling, and it's finding it hard to come out of this bad state.

41
00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:54.910
milen | Erigon: But yeah, it seems like it's just behind…

42
00:08:55.350 --> 00:09:03.209
milen | Erigon: like, 20 seconds or something. I've not seen this before, and I've not seen this on other… any of the other nodes.

43
00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:08.219
milen | Erigon: On Saka DevNet 3 yet, so yeah, I'm just gonna…

44
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.280
milen | Erigon: Spend another hour or two trying to see what's happening.

45
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.710
milen | Erigon: But it's not something that I'm necessarily worried about.

46
00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:24.979
milen | Erigon: In terms of Fusaka releases. It's, it's not looking like a, like a bug related to Fusaka.

47
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:32.530
Barnabas: We could take a look at the physical, properties of that one machine and find out if there's something wrong with the disk on that node.

48
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:41.110
milen | Erigon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll… I'll talk to you offline, after this, yeah, with further info.

49
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.830
Barnabas: Yeah, sounds good.

50
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:52.780
Barnabas: Anyone else has anything, regarding Postaka or Dublin Street?

51
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:05.630
Ben Adams: Yeah, we're… if we… if we don't resolve this issue with the… the blocks… Soon, we're considering

52
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:12.519
Ben Adams: It's an issue… instability in master, so we're considering, releasing

53
00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.589
Ben Adams: the Fusaka change on top of our previous release.

54
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:20.959
Barnabas: Yeah, the food out.

55
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.590
Ben Adams: result.

56
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.010
Ben Adams: True.

57
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:33.859
Barnabas: Yeah, ideally we should have the client releases and out by Thursday, and hopefully a code freeze by end of today.

58
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:44.929
Barnabas: Obviously, if you still have a known bug, then that code freeze is probably not gonna work out for NetherMind, for example, but for the other client things.

59
00:10:51.960 --> 00:11:00.390
Barnabas: Regarding, Shadow Forks, we still have a pending, PR that hasn't been merged. This is,

60
00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.610
Barnabas: Updating the Osakusta blob schedule for the Chainspack for Nethermind.

61
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:14.280
Barnabas: And, we would like to merge this in, in order to be able to do a Shadow Fork

62
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.280
Barnabas: forming that as well.

63
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:26.239
Barnabas: Could, some EL client teams please, give some more thumbs up, because this report requires, more approvals.

64
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:48.829
Barnabas: Okay, so maybe after Thursday we can take a look at doing a sheet of work?

65
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:52.990
Barnabas: For Hosky, ideally, we would want to do that on Friday.

66
00:11:53.120 --> 00:12:02.050
Barnabas: It's probably gonna be a rather small network, nothing crazy, because of the big machines that we would need for the database sizes.

67
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:08.059
Barnabas: We just want to validate that, we're not going to have a similar situation what we had with Petra.

68
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:17.350
Barnabas: And, should be good to go for next week's ACDT to discuss the results of the shadow clock.

69
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:29.989
Barnabas: So if there's no more, Future-related topics, then we could probably go into the guesstimate testing updates?

70
00:12:34.650 --> 00:12:36.080
Barnabas: Yep, awesome.

71
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.339
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, I wanted to bring up, I'm writing a test for Xen.

72
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:46.269
jochem-brouwer: So Xen is, like, a very, like, the biggest, I think one of the biggest state contacts on mainnet.

73
00:12:46.350 --> 00:13:02.000
jochem-brouwer: And, I want to test there, like, the gas limit updates which we… well, we might want to do soon. So, I want to test against 45 million gas, but also against 60 million gas and 100 million gas. And for this, I'm using Nevermind's gas benchmark tool.

74
00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:12.359
jochem-brouwer: But, I'm running into issues, actually, running these tests against other clients, and I'm running the tooling in this

75
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.410
jochem-brouwer: VR?

76
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:30.649
jochem-brouwer: And yeah, I have some questions I also asked them on Discord, which I hope that someone from Nevermind can help me out. One of the things is, there is this Nevermind GP hacked image, which is being used as an hacked engine API image.

77
00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:50.229
jochem-brouwer: But I would need to change that even further, because I need to change also the timestamps there, and I cannot find the source code of this. So, I would really like to know if this code is actually closed source, that could, of course, also be, or that I just did not find it, so maybe someone from that of mind knows where this is.

78
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:53.159
jochem-brouwer: So it's… it's this image. Let me copy that.

79
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.959
Barnabas: Is anyone from the NetherMind team able to comment on this GP hacked?

80
00:14:09.310 --> 00:14:10.120
Barnabas: source?

81
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:24.099
Barnabas: If not, then maybe this could be taken offline and, discussed in the…

82
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.790
jochem-brouwer: Yes, okay.

83
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:34.770
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, okay, yeah, then I will also ask, because I had some other questions also about, this, gas benchmark tool, but I think, yeah, I will just, keep,

84
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.490
jochem-brouwer: Porting people were.

85
00:14:36.810 --> 00:14:37.890
jochem-brouwer: For this, yeah.

86
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:52.450
jochem-brouwer: I think Martin from the NetherMind team is working on this, I don't know if he's here, but I would really like some help, because I would really like to generate a report before this Thursday. But, yeah, I think this tool is perfect for it, but I cannot run the test on top of that.

87
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:58.679
jochem-brouwer: And otherwise, I have to write, I think, exactly the same as this tool does myself, but that would, of course, be a little bit of an overkill.

88
00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.889
jochem-brouwer: So it would be great if someone could help. Yeah, thanks.

89
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:04.200
Barnabas: Yes.

90
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:09.030
Marcin Sobczak: Hi. Yes, I'm here, I'm, checking it right now.

91
00:15:10.740 --> 00:15:19.539
jochem-brouwer: Cool, cool, yeah, you can contact me on Discord, on Telegram, but that would be really helpful, yeah, thanks. I've also commented on the issues, yeah, thank you, thank you.

92
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:28.099
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other updates regarding the gas limit testing?

93
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.560
Barnabas: Yes.

94
00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:33.270
Barnabas: I'm coming.

95
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:45.289
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so, related to the IEP17935, so Sophia was asking, on Bayside if, we are

96
00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:59.260
Ameziane Hamlat: Okay, for, $60 million. So, unfortunately, we haven't reached consensus inside the team, so we are still discussing. So, some folks are, in favor, others against.

97
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.660
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so we are still, trying to find,

98
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:15.500
Ameziane Hamlat: like, the way to go, at least from our side. But related to the work on the arithmetic operations,

99
00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:21.149
Ameziane Hamlat: We have a few PRs that are… that are passing all the reference tests.

100
00:16:22.530 --> 00:16:30.460
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so we… we are… we are basically testing, but it's in a very, very good, stage at… at this moment.

101
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:38.750
Barnabas: Would you consider bumping the default gas limit on, for example, Holoski to 60 million?

102
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.129
Barnabas: Or, or all the different snaps?

103
00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.770
Barnabas: Because I think the only open question right now is, gas and Bazoo.

104
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:57.460
Ameziane Hamlat: So, what do you mean? Because Holisky and, they are already at 60 million.

105
00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.489
Barnabas: Oh, dear. Okay. Sorry.

106
00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:17.880
Ameziane Hamlat: So, Sepolia and Holieski are already at 60 million, so there should… no issue, because they are already there. I mean, we are, like, testing heavily, like, the 60 million guys. So, we… like, the remaining issue on Bayou side are some arithmetic operations,

107
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:22.469
Ameziane Hamlat: So, my proposal was to, basically go

108
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:38.089
Ameziane Hamlat: with the current state, to, with Sepolia and Holosky, and have another release, like, with the performance improvement, like, the increment that is only performance improvement on Hodi and Mainnet.

109
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.320
Ameziane Hamlat: But yeah, but we haven't reached any consensus yet.

110
00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:51.470
Ameziane Hamlat: Because, I mean, it's too risky. I can understand, like, the… Yeah, the…

111
00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:59.920
Ameziane Hamlat: like, the other opinion to… to say, like, it's too risky, to… to have, like, a new algorithm, like.

112
00:18:00.130 --> 00:18:02.450
Ameziane Hamlat: Few, a few weeks before Mainnet.

113
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:11.920
Ameziane Hamlat: But, yeah, I will update anyway on what we decide.

114
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:18.610
Barnabas: Okay, thank you. Is anyone from GAST in this call that…

115
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:24.010
Barnabas: that could comment on Perry's recent comment about the library change.

116
00:18:24.810 --> 00:18:30.729
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I can comment on that. We changed, our library for ModeX,

117
00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:41.740
Marius van der Wijden: Well, no, we pulled in some improvements for Modex into a fork, that we're using now for, the short term, and for the medium term, we…

118
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:54.290
Marius van der Wijden: are working with the Go Standard Library to upstream our changes, and we also switched to GNARC for the BN256 stuff.

119
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.079
Marius van der Wijden: Sorry, BN254 for…

120
00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:09.329
Marius van der Wijden: For… for the smart people in the back. And yeah, it's, with this, we are good for 60 million.

121
00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:22.760
Barnabas: That's great. So, right now, the only open,

122
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:26.179
Barnabas: Question is pesos at $6 million, right?

123
00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.539
Barnabas: Do we have any other ERC line?

124
00:19:28.690 --> 00:19:30.320
Barnabas: Is that questionable?

125
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.070
Marius van der Wijden: Nope.

126
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:38.469
Marius van der Wijden: It's, just Bisu. There are things that…

127
00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:54.610
Marius van der Wijden: we are looking into in order to get, to be really sure about 60, and especially to be sure about, like, everything beyond 60. So, the thing that Jocham is doing with, with, Zen and the…

128
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:58.459
Marius van der Wijden: The, the, the worst case blocks.

129
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:10.300
Marius van der Wijden: for state access. It's one of the things that will, de-risk this, hopefully, and so I hope we will have, some early analysis, soon on that.

130
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:25.050
Marius van der Wijden: And then the next, the next bigger issue, the bigger issues, after 60, and the, the big one is, at roughly 70.

131
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:29.150
Marius van der Wijden: is, the receipt size,

132
00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.000
Marius van der Wijden: And for that, we would need ETH, the ETH70 protocol.

133
00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:43.890
Marius van der Wijden: But the problem is that it's quite hard, because basically you split up the receipts, on the sending side, when you…

134
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:56.160
Marius van der Wijden: When you connect to a node, or when you, when you request the receipts, the receipts are split up on the sending side, and they must be, must be reconstructed on the receiving side.

135
00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:03.069
Marius van der Wijden: And that is a bigger change, so no client yet has implemented ETH70.

136
00:21:03.690 --> 00:21:06.370
Marius van der Wijden: And, then there are other…

137
00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:16.879
Marius van der Wijden: other things preventing us from going further, but, all of this is being worked on, and, yeah. So, for now, Besu…

138
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:23.959
Marius van der Wijden: Seems to be the one holding… the thing holding us back from moving to 260 and beyond.

139
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.999
Marius van der Wijden: But yeah, the next step then would already P70, so, yeah.

140
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:41.210
Marius van der Wijden: I think there's value in going to 60 soon, but we will need some time afterwards to figure out some stuff before we go beyond 60.

141
00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:50.470
Barnabas: Could, Bezo increase to something lower, something like, 55 or $50 million, comfortably?

142
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:58.939
Barnabas: Or 60 is, like, the absolute minimum that everyone's targeting, because currently we are at, 45 million.

143
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:00.450
Barnabas: I recall correctly.

144
00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:18.439
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so from… from the current numbers, like, just, maybe, a bit of history. So, before East tests, there was no issue at 60 million. That's why currently we have, like, Sipolia and Holoscuran in at 6 million, because

145
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:24.350
Ameziane Hamlat: We thought that there is, like, no worst case, that, like, has this,

146
00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:40.159
Ameziane Hamlat: that has less than, like, 15 MGAS per second, like, 20 mgas per second, which is, like, the bar to have, like, 60 million. But, with EAST, tests, like, the new test from the testing team.

147
00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:45.250
Ameziane Hamlat: So we have, like, these new use cases where Besu is,

148
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.049
Ameziane Hamlat: Has, like, a throughput around 15,

149
00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:59.010
Ameziane Hamlat: 15 MGAS per second, which is basically the bar for the 45. So either we go to 60, because we have an improvement.

150
00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:11.909
Ameziane Hamlat: like, we ship it, then I'm pretty sure that it would be above 60 million. But, like, if we go with only version, 45 is the one to go.

151
00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:16.240
Barnabas: Okay.

152
00:23:20.890 --> 00:23:25.179
Tim Beiko: And so the… The worst case scenario here is…

153
00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:28.560
Tim Beiko: if we went to 60 with Fusaka.

154
00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:43.150
Tim Beiko: and there's an issue in Baisu's new implementation, and there were these worst-case, blocks, then BESU… do we know exactly how long it would take Baesu to process a block?

155
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.550
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, so…

156
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:57.450
Ameziane Hamlat: So, I mean, it's very simple math, so if we have, like, 60 million blocks, with,

157
00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:14.249
Ameziane Hamlat: like, full of mode, for example, where, like, we have 15 amb gas per second. So that block would be, processed in around 3.5 seconds. It's, it's roughly. So, basically, above, 3 seconds.

158
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.840
Ameziane Hamlat: And, like, the main issue, would be, basically missing,

159
00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:29.150
Ameziane Hamlat: attestations, as I would not attest in the right head, in terms of block building, maybe build, smaller blocks.

160
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:43.480
Ameziane Hamlat: But, I mean, that… that would be very specific for basu notes, maybe fall behind the head for some blocks. Yeah, but… but in general,

161
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:51.269
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, in general, the risk is not that high, but the other risk is actually having a consensus bag.

162
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:58.400
Ameziane Hamlat: I mean, if we ship it, so if, like, we go with the new implementation, the…

163
00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:08.370
Ameziane Hamlat: So we, yeah, we can have a bug in that implementation, so we need to roll back to the old one, and yeah, and basically have, like, the current performance issue.

164
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:22.550
Tim Beiko: Right.

165
00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:35.840
Tim Beiko: Yeah, I know, I'm curious… how others feel, but I… I think… being…

166
00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:41.820
Tim Beiko: I don't know, I think we're kind of trading off, like, 25%.

167
00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:46.080
Tim Beiko: increase… Yeah, so I… yeah.

168
00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:55.969
Barnabas: Are we talking about now just one… basically one slot, or, like, as long as the potential attack lost, right?

169
00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:04.460
Barnabas: So if you have, maybe 10 or 15 consecutive blocks, then… or that half an epoch, basically would lag behind.

170
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:07.229
Barnabas: One or two slots, always.

171
00:26:07.230 --> 00:26:09.859
Tim Beiko: Yeah, well, also if this is a proposal, right?

172
00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:21.519
Ameziane Hamlat: I don't know. So, if Bezo is a proposer, the only issue is basically produce a smaller block.

173
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:36.539
Ameziane Hamlat: Because… because the selection, the way that we select transactions is, like, time-limited, so we, we select, like, transactions together in the next block, up to, like, some percentage of the time that we allow for

174
00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:42.650
Ameziane Hamlat: block building, like, local block buildings, so that's not an issue. But if we,

175
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:50.099
Ameziane Hamlat: like, if, BESU… like, for other full nodes, like, that need to process the block, especially for validators.

176
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:58.260
Ameziane Hamlat: The only issue I see is basically missing, like, the attestations, but…

177
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:14.200
Ameziane Hamlat: that's not, like, the whole… the whole base of notes, because, you have, like, like, some percentage of the… of the… of the full notes on some specific, slots. So, like, the attack, I think, to, like, to…

178
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:28.250
Ameziane Hamlat: to be, to… to have, like, all the basel nodes, impacted, we need to have, like, multiple blocks, full of, like, mod operations, for example, to be,

179
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.939
Ameziane Hamlat: Not only one block, basically.

180
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:46.760
Barnabas: Do we want to be this… To be a blocker?

181
00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.290
Barnabas: Going to 60 million.

182
00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:55.719
Tim Beiko: Oh, I guess one more question.

183
00:27:56.230 --> 00:28:04.689
Tim Beiko: Yeah, we can maybe decide this on Thursday, but it's good for people to think about. But one more question is just the impact on the,

184
00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:13.330
Tim Beiko: on the hardware, like, if people are running base 2 on better hardware than the standard one, are they…

185
00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:20.650
Tim Beiko: Also affected by this, or does, like, yeah, better hardware, helps.

186
00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:35.579
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, that's a good question. I would… I would say hard to… I think it will help, for sure, because, like, when we profile a big integer implementation, most of the time.

187
00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:48.580
Ameziane Hamlat: is on CPU, but it would help only if the clock, like, the clock speed is, basically better, because we are not doing any parallel execution with,

188
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:53.159
Ameziane Hamlat: With, with that algorithm, so the number of cores, will,

189
00:28:53.290 --> 00:28:59.449
Ameziane Hamlat: Will not help, but if it has a better clock, it will help, yes, for sure.

190
00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:14.400
Tim Beiko: Got it. Yeah, so I think we don't necessarily have to make a call about this today, but,

191
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:23.090
Tim Beiko: I think, ideally, this Thursday, we would, because, yeah, we have the CIP specifying what the default is, and,

192
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:30.710
Tim Beiko: Obviously, if we, are moving mainnet to 60 million, it'd be good to start signaling that.

193
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.969
Tim Beiko: But yeah, I think it's reasonable for people to take a couple more days to think about,

194
00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.269
Tim Beiko: How to… how to move forward.

195
00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:44.899
Barnabas: Yeah, ideally, we want to make a decision about this, I think, on… by the end of this week.

196
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:46.480
Tim Beiko: Yeah.

197
00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:59.120
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, I agree. I will update anyway, so we have been, like, discussing, like, almost a week yet, so we need to, yeah, to make a decision.

198
00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:05.940
Barnabas: Okay.

199
00:30:06.290 --> 00:30:10.420
Barnabas: Is there any other topics to discuss regarding death limit testing?

200
00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:16.990
Barnabas: If not, then we can move on to glance program testing updates.

201
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:20.680
Barnabas: Anyone from EPBS?

202
00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:23.740
Barnabas: Would like to discuss EPBS progress?

203
00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:40.109
Barnabas: Otherwise, we could move on to… Doctor Access List Testing.

204
00:30:41.030 --> 00:30:44.610
Barnabas: Anyone from… Both teams are here.

205
00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.920
Toni Wahrstätter: I can give a quick update.

206
00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.250
Barnabas: Sure.

207
00:30:48.250 --> 00:30:56.149
Toni Wahrstätter: So on Wednesday, there is the third Block Live Access List breakout call, and we're going to discuss if we should move from

208
00:30:56.290 --> 00:31:00.390
Toni Wahrstätter: A block-level access list hash that is currently in the execution header.

209
00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:18.339
Toni Wahrstätter: to, try, and this will be discussed on… on the next breakout call. It would be a rather small change, and currently default is no, but, if you have an opinion on that, then please do show up to the breakout call on Wednesday, 2PM UTC.

210
00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:26.870
Toni Wahrstätter: And regarding testing, let's see if someone else, like Philippe or Rahu is on the call, who are better at that.

211
00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.280
felipe: Yeah, I can give a quick update.

212
00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:41.640
felipe: We've been sort of refactoring some of the absence checks on the testing side.

213
00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:50.210
felipe: And there's a PR that should be up, and ready, and Rahul has been adding some test cases there.

214
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:55.240
felipe: And we need a couple updates on the spec side as well.

215
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:04.430
felipe: But these should be, these should be coming in as well this week.

216
00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:30.449
Toni Wahrstätter: All right, and just to add, to that, last week we were discussing about the CL implementation. Yeah, thanks to Nico, Terrence, and Jihoon, we now have, Lodestar and Prism implementations, and now we are about to…

217
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.840
Toni Wahrstätter: Start testing everything locally.

218
00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:43.479
Barnabas: Yeah, that sounds good. And maybe we can aim for a first-det launch in a couple of weeks.

219
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.919
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, sounds realistic, I think.

220
00:32:57.420 --> 00:33:01.760
Barnabas: Yes, nobody from EPBS is here to give us an update.

221
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.160
Barnabas: Regarding specs, maybe, Justin?

222
00:33:06.390 --> 00:33:09.829
Barnabas: Give us an update. How… how is the spec coming along?

223
00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:14.290
Justin Traglia: I would say the spec is coming along pretty well.

224
00:33:14.740 --> 00:33:21.719
Justin Traglia: Last week, we merged a bunch of tests and a few minor spec changes, like, not related to testing.

225
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:26.379
Justin Traglia: And we are currently working on a release. So,

226
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:35.639
Justin Traglia: I believe, EPBS DevNet 0 will be based off of, instances specs V, like, beta.0.

227
00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:41.459
Barnabas: Right, so Beta.0 will be also the one that's targeting for data sets.

228
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:46.359
Justin Traglia: Correct, and you can expect that.

229
00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:50.200
Justin Traglia: 24 hours from right now, I just restarted the action.

230
00:33:55.030 --> 00:33:55.930
Barnabas: Sounds good.

231
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:05.539
Barnabas: Terrence also said that he's about to join in to give us an update.

232
00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.010
Barnabas: Oh, looks like he's here now.

233
00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.039
terence: Hello?

234
00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:17.580
Barnabas: Hi, Terence. Could you give us an update on EPBS testing and, how… how are things looking?

235
00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:30.060
terence: Yeah, for sure. Yeah, yeah. Thanks for, calling me. So, so we are at the point that, like, all the containers on the EPBS side is finalized.

236
00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:40.070
terence: for the current DefNet Zero spec. So, since last Friday, the priority was to cut the spec release for EPBS, or for Gloise,

237
00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:58.280
terence: for EIP7732, and they have a consensus spec test. So once we have a consensus bet test, we can start, like, do more implementation, because, like, now we can actually ensure correctness. And, so we're at the point that we're waiting for a spec release. I know Justin's working on it.

238
00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:14.270
terence: So I think, in the EPBS channel, the latest progress was there was some problem generating spat tests, and Justin is working on that. So once we have that, yeah, we can start,

239
00:35:14.730 --> 00:35:25.029
terence: putting more… a lot more efforts into implementation, because we know the spec test is there. And, there's the EPPS breakout room this Friday.

240
00:35:25.030 --> 00:35:36.210
terence: And Justin will be hosting that, and that's typically very organized, and Justin is doing a very good job of that. So I encourage all the clients that is implementing that will implement

241
00:35:36.210 --> 00:35:56.120
terence: gloves, on for the consistent layer during that call. But, otherwise, yeah, it's going mostly on this… mostly the last few weeks, we have been just mostly focusing on the SPAC, getting the SPAC into, like, a definite zero readiness stage, and now we'll do more implementation.

242
00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.939
terence: Questions, feedback, welcome.

243
00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:06.159
Justin Traglia: Yep, and Terrence, the issue has been fixed, and I have restarted the release action, so we can expect

244
00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:09.909
Justin Traglia: Hopefully, it is complete in 24 hours.

245
00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:12.659
terence: Yeah, sounds… thank you.

246
00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.530
Barnabas: Thanks for the update.

247
00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.849
Barnabas: Anyone else has anything else to add to clumpster, then?

248
00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:34.169
Justin Traglia: We did make a small PR merch,

249
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:40.850
Justin Traglia: End of last week regarding, like, helper functions for the… Like, slot.

250
00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:45.440
Justin Traglia: timing functions or whatever. I can find a link here in a second.

251
00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:50.079
