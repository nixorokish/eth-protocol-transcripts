00:13:59	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Geth team has an approach they like with a lib change they are planning on getting upstreamed into the go official release. So they have a short term plan as well as long term one for unblocking us on gas limit increase. 

Besu is currently working on some optimisations as well, would be good to hear an update there
00:14:01	Toni Wahrstätter:	Is it testing XEN or the operations that XEN uses, but max'ed out with re to gaslimit?
00:14:17	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Is it testing XEN ..."

testing directly XEN contract on top of mainnet state
00:14:27	FLCL:	yup
00:14:30	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Client changes + Xen contract work from Jochem are the blockers for gas limit increase rn, so hopefully we can start discussing it in a future ACD
00:15:03	Toni Wahrstätter:	Wouldn't it make even more sense going even further than XEN, testing the actual worst-cases?
00:16:58	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Is it testing XEN ..."

I think that would be part of statebloat network with twice the state? So this indeed tests the current worst situation (also with raised gas limit so we can hit more trie nodes). But bigger state likely even worse.
What you might be getting at is a contract without execution and just SSTORE spam, that is indeed even worse. But currently calling approve() on XEN is ~7k gas for changed trie nodes, so somewhat close to the SSTORE spam contract
00:17:05	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Yeah the testnets are already at 60M
00:17:10	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Its a question about when we do this for mainnet

00:19:29	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Besu + Xen
00:19:33	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Are open questions
00:19:34	Luis Pinto | Besu:	From Besu: the main gist for disfavouring it is that if something goes bad it could delay Fusaka. And we discussed that if PeerDas is ready we should ship it regardless. AFAIK this gas limit increase does not need a hard fork

00:20:55	jochem-brouwer:	Do we have an EEST test for this? (Receipt logs size > 10 MiB)
00:21:10	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Do we have an EEST..."

Does this help? https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/main/tests/benchmark/test_worst_opcode.py 
It is for LOG tho
00:22:06	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Tradeoff for coordination in scaling won’t really make sense
00:22:23	Parithosh Jayanthi:	55M to 60M is too minor a diff for eg
00:22:28	Tim Beiko:	Reacted to "55M to 60M is too mi…" with 👍
00:22:49	Barnabas:	Replying to "Tradeoff for coordin..."

we have fusaka anyways planning to come, so we could just push the defaults there
00:23:00	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Tradeoff for coordin..."

Yup that’s the plan
00:23:03	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Do we have an EEST..."

Yes it is indeed related to LOGs. Test would look like that one 😃👍 For LOG it is likely better to not create one big LOG (due to quadratic memory gas costs) but in some smaller ones to hit the "lowest" gas limit we could hit the 10 MiB+ receipt size
00:23:05	Tim Beiko:	Replying to "Tradeoff for coordin…"
Yes, I think we should focus on the Fusaka defaults now
00:24:22	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Worst worst case (only if there is a specific attack) besu nodes would lag one slot behind with their attestations
00:25:06	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "Worst worst case (on..."

block proposal impact as well. nobody likes missing their proposal.
00:25:10	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
I don’t see who would have any incentive for such an attack, given that it would be quite costly
00:25:33	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
Right, block proposal is another one
00:25:33	lightclient:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
reduce client diversity

Could besu not just build with a max gas of 45m? That would make it safe
00:26:28	lightclient:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
still less profitable
00:26:38	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
Only in an attack scenario
00:26:50	Ben Adams:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on..."

when does a local block builder make a 45m block?
00:27:13	lightclient:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
i assume when it “detects” an attack?
00:27:13	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on…"
Right, my 45m comment was wrong
00:27:14	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "Worst worst case (on..."

in ansgars scenario, always.
00:27:36	Marius van der Wijden:	Also it would only impact besu nodes on the standard hardware
00:27:39	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on..."

Even during the attack, the attacker would need to pay more than everyone else - it would mostly affect attestations

00:29:29	Parithosh Jayanthi:	At target blocks there’s no attack, they can process at 10-15M/s. target would be 30M, so 2s to process the block.
00:29:43	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Worst worst case (on..."

The issue is at 60M fully used blocks
