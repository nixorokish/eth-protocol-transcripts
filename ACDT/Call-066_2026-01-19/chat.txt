01:02:27	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

But it is taking the whole block, so no place to other transactions to be included in that block
01:03:05	Francesco:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Even with the tx gas limit, I can simply buy out all gas in the block. Why does it matter if I do it with one tx or 4?
01:03:23	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Transaction parallelisation
01:05:00	Francesco:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Can you say exactly what your concern is with that? The block we’re talking about has a single tx but it consumes only 16.7Mgas, we don’t need to parallelize anything
01:05:06	Ben Adams:	BALs can do the internal tx IO parallelised so isn't such a problem (for a validator) and the builder who builds the BAL chooses to put it in (so additional effort in building the BAL is on them)
01:05:17	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Even with the tx gas limit, I can simply buy out all gas in the block. Why does it matter if I do it with one tx or 4?

Yes, but you cannot guarantee that you’re going to use the whole block gas limit because transactions can go in different blocks, where with one transaction, you’re sure to use the whole gas of 1 block
01:05:20	Francesco:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

It’s the same as a post-BAL block that only contains a single tx because the builder wants it so
01:06:19	Potuz:	I completely agree, we just need to specify the builder API and the only change is that we now can connect to many endpoints instead of one and it should not be speced how to connect to many endpoints
01:07:09	Potuz:	@Dustin a hard request from the community was to standardize client flags so that operators can set the same flags across different clients
01:07:13	Potuz:	things like min-bid, etc
01:07:23	Potuz:	those things should be standardized on the builder API
01:07:36	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

That’s actually for me what shouldn’t happen, having 1 tx consuming the whole block.
01:07:42	Ben Adams:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Also you can put a whole bunch of additional txs in that only update state; even if all the state growth gas has been used
01:07:51	Francesco:	Reacted to "Also you can put a w..." with 👍
01:08:19	Dustin:	Replying to "those things shoul..."

the current approach ties this in to the builder proxy? i.e. the config gets unified there
01:08:22	Francesco:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

That’s actually for me what shouldn’t happen, having 1 tx consuming the whole block.

Why? It was like this until Fusaka, and it’s not why we introduced the tx gas limit. Plus, builders can always just buy out a whole block
01:08:33	Dustin:	Replying to "those things shoul..."

(whether that proxy is named mev-boost or commit boost)
01:08:40	Justin Traglia:	Yeah we’ll talk on discord
01:08:48	Francesco:	Replying to "As I understood it, ..."

Anyway, do we agree that the concern isn’t about parallelization?
01:08:51	Bharath:	Replying to "those things should ..."

Agreed that builder muxing is mostly implementation details. We probably want to standardize params like min-bid, bid-boost flags etc. Most of the PR specifies params like min-bid, bid-boost, max-trusted-bid etc
01:08:52	Justin Traglia:	Bye everyone!
