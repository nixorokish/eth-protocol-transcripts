00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.770
Parithosh Jayanthi: Hello, everyone.

2
00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:49.959
Matthew Keil: Happy Easter Park to ya.

3
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.519
Parithosh Jayanthi: Happy to go to you as well.

4
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:40.919
Parithosh Jayanthi: Let's give people another minute, and then we can start.

5
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:58.179
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, let's get started then. First item on the agenda is getting an update on block-level access for StevNets. Stefan, you have the floor, do you want to give us an update?

6
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.899
Stefan Starflinger: Yeah, sure. So, definite one.

7
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:16.919
Stefan Starflinger: was working pretty well. We got syncing fixed in most clients, which is really nice. And, we managed to run stable with EVM fuzzing and Uniswap trades as the workload.

8
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:27.240
Stefan Starflinger: The only thing we couldn't get done was the benchmarking part, with parallel I.O. and parallel execution, so that will be moved to, definite 2.

9
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:36.950
Stefan Starflinger: And in general, now we have to decide what we want to put into, Definite 2, and what we want to push for Definite 3.

10
00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.670
Stefan Starflinger: I think that is a quick summary.

11
00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:48.179
Parithosh Jayanthi: Awesome. Yeah, we have finalizing DevNet2 scope a bit later in this,

12
00:08:48.429 --> 00:08:51.599
Parithosh Jayanthi: Actually, we can already continue with that.

13
00:08:52.549 --> 00:09:05.789
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, let's… let's just continue with MNET2 scope, then. Was there… I see Spencer has this, comment in the issue. Do we want to just go through the comment and solve all of the questions?

14
00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:23.149
Parithosh Jayanthi: Eip7843. So the question is, do we push this to DevNet 3, or keep it on DevNet 2? This requires CL changes, and there's two open, PRs linked over there. Who has the most context on this?

15
00:09:30.439 --> 00:09:36.389
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, looking at it, it mostly looks like engine API changes, are…

16
00:09:37.989 --> 00:09:43.429
Parithosh Jayanthi: Stefan, do you have an idea how many CLs are ready with block-level access lists to begin with?

17
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:48.220
Stefan Starflinger: So the only CL we've been using is Lodestar.

18
00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.520
Stefan Starflinger: Because there is some inconsistency between Prism and Lodestar that we haven't been able to figure out.

19
00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.760
Stefan Starflinger: And Lodestar has already merged the PR, for this change.

20
00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:07.429
Stefan Starflinger: It hasn't been tested, but it seemed to be pretty small. I can share it in the chat.

21
00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.749
Stefan Starflinger: In a second.

22
00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:18.219
Stefan Starflinger: But I would generally prefer to keep it in, unless there is a reason not to. I don't think it's that much of a change.

23
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.109
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, it doesn't look too big. Yeah, minimalist?

24
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:33.240
Barnabas: Yeah, so I reached out to Pawan last weekend, and he said that, he will have a DevNet2 ready branch, or Lighthouse, either today or tomorrow.

25
00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:48.019
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, perfect. So, since this is mostly an engine API change, and Lodestar already has it, let's keep it in, and if there's any opposition, then let's take it out later, but for now, let's keep it in.

26
00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:50.870
Parithosh Jayanthi: Sounds good.

27
00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:54.040
Stefan Starflinger: Yep.

28
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:59.520
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, next item is EIP8024.

29
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.959
Parithosh Jayanthi: This is switch encoding to push postfix.

30
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.200
Parithosh Jayanthi: I'm posting the link there…

31
00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:25.459
Parithosh Jayanthi: Has anyone already reviewed this PR? Will this be a big change? It looks like it's an EL change, so does… do any of the ELs have a preference?

32
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.639
Parithosh Jayanthi: How many do we have any of the EL devs here?

33
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.989
Parithosh Jayanthi: Fabio, do you maybe want to speak for Bezu? Or Lukash for Netherland?

34
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:06.559
Łukasz Rozmej: Hmm, sir, what's the question?

35
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:11.920
Parithosh Jayanthi: So the question is, does a change to EIP8024?

36
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.690
Parithosh Jayanthi: And we want to know if they should be included in two DevNets.

37
00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:20.809
Parithosh Jayanthi: 2, or if she… we should delay to DevNet 3.

38
00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:24.170
Parithosh Jayanthi: I don't see any…

39
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:36.520
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay. I also see a comment on the PR itself that says, probably not going with this change, so, okay, maybe we just deny this change for now, and if it needs to go in, we can bring it up on ACD.

40
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.300
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

41
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:50.349
Parithosh Jayanthi: The next, order of business is EIP7778, confirm alignment on specs, and this is from,

42
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.239
Parithosh Jayanthi: From Tony, so you have the floor, Tony?

43
00:12:54.940 --> 00:13:06.370
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, I brought up this topic on the Execution Dev Discord, I will post the link to the message into the chat, and I wanted to clarify if we want to use the

44
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:12.270
Toni Wahrstätter: Gas used pre-refunds, or gas used after refunds for accounting.

45
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:15.699
Toni Wahrstätter: The cumulative gas used in the receipts.

46
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:32.899
Toni Wahrstätter: And Andrew brought up last time on ACD that Aragon prefers to use the gas used before the refunds, which means that the block gas accounting will be consistent with the gas accounting in the receipt.

47
00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:37.840
Toni Wahrstätter: And I quickly talked with Felix from Geth, and he was also…

48
00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.860
Toni Wahrstätter: Saying that this might be the cleanest solution to do.

49
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.869
Toni Wahrstätter: The thing is, this might also mean that we…

50
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:51.949
Toni Wahrstätter: might want to introduce a new field to the receipt. Basically, the gas spent.

51
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:56.200
Toni Wahrstätter: So this will be the gas used, by the transaction.

52
00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.190
Toni Wahrstätter: Pre-refund.

53
00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:08.270
Toni Wahrstätter: Sorry, post-refund. So this could be used to, populate the field gas used in the EVE getTransaction receipt.

54
00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:19.209
Toni Wahrstätter: And now I'm wondering if other clients have an opinion on that. This is the way how it's currently spec'd. So in the specs, we recently changed it to having this new, field in the receipt.

55
00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:33.819
Toni Wahrstätter: Because, yeah, as I said, this might be needed because gas use now has different meanings, depending on do we use it for block gas limit enforcement, or do we use it to communicate that info to the user?

56
00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:42.089
Toni Wahrstätter: So, I'm wondering if anyone has an opinion on that, or if anyone is opposed to doing it that way.

57
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:45.600
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Ben?

58
00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:53.590
Ben Adams: Yeah, so I think the cumulative gas use Needs to be the…

59
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.869
Ben Adams: The amount used by the block.

60
00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.980
Ben Adams: Not the amount. So… pre-refund.

61
00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:08.669
Ben Adams: But I do also think, in line with ETH transfers, and it's a log,

62
00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:13.909
Ben Adams: We will need that extra field, saying how much

63
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:21.420
Ben Adams: was actually spent in gas for the transaction. So… post-refund.

64
00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:27.949
Ben Adams: And we could, replace, like, Logs Bloom with it if we want.

65
00:15:28.530 --> 00:15:30.309
Ben Adams: Rather than adding a new field.

66
00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:43.990
Parithosh Jayanthi: So you'd be in favor of keeping it in the same format, as it is right now, right?

67
00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:57.300
Ben Adams: The… the one proposed by the… as the change, yes. But… but I think we need a change to the receipts so that if you're trying to use the available data.

68
00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:01.849
Ben Adams: To track how much… An account's balance has changed.

69
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.689
Ben Adams: And we need to include the post-refund. You know, how much did the account spend?

70
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.090
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, exactly. This is how it's specced right now.

71
00:16:13.630 --> 00:16:14.110
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah.

72
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:20.290
Ben Adams: Because we can't work out the, we can't do the… Jason or a PC, otherwise.

73
00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:21.600
Ben Adams: Or…

74
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.030
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, exactly.

75
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:31.409
Ben Adams: also undermines, ETH transfers in Metalog, if we don't have… How much the account spent.

76
00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:33.820
Toni Wahrstätter: Right.

77
00:16:34.690 --> 00:16:43.950
Toni Wahrstätter: Is there also someone from Beso, just to… or… and from Rife? Because then… then it would be great if we get an opinion from all the clients on this.

78
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:47.520
Toni Wahrstätter: Also, if Gef has an official opinion.

79
00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.650
Toni Wahrstätter: It'd be great to have that clarified today.

80
00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.099
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I see Daniel from GETS, do you want to speak up?

81
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:10.960
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I can speak for Besso. We have not really looked into the PR, so it seems…

82
00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:16.360
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I think we are fine with whatever is proposed.

83
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.070
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): I really don't have much details at the moment, but…

84
00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:27.810
Daniel Lehrner (Besu): Neither… neither proposal seems to be a big problem for us, at least from the implementation side.

85
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:46.639
Toni Wahrstätter: Okay, great. Yeah, I think… I think it will still keep the… keep the scope, quite limited. The only thing is that clients have been using, cumulative gas to determine what is the gas used of a transaction when it comes to e-gat transaction receipt calls.

86
00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:52.369
Toni Wahrstätter: And yeah, the change that is now needed is basically to keep the…

87
00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:56.659
Toni Wahrstätter: Same behavior there that we have today.

88
00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:01.450
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, if you haven't looked into it, please,

89
00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:11.300
Toni Wahrstätter: just check it out and comment on the EV… on the execution dev, but I would then assume we go ahead, create the test cases, for this new

90
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.490
Toni Wahrstätter: format.

91
00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:15.970
Toni Wahrstätter: And also already included.

92
00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:20.320
Toni Wahrstätter: In this new, with those new changes in the second DevNet.

93
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:27.309
Parithosh Jayanthi: How much work or time do you think it'll be adding to DevNet2?

94
00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:40.870
Toni Wahrstätter: I can't answer that, so from the specs and ERP side, it's done. It very much depends on how much work is it to add new fields to the receipt. I think that's the only thing.

95
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:45.320
Toni Wahrstätter: I don't really have insights into how much work this is at the client.

96
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:55.559
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, then I think I'd prefer moving it to DevNet 2, so we do it in the next DevNet, and bite the bullet, even if it takes a little bit longer.

97
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:58.209
Parithosh Jayanthi: Does that sound good for everyone?

98
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:05.629
Ben Adams: Move the change, or the EIP?

99
00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:11.379
Parithosh Jayanthi: as in the EIP, as well as the change, is included in the scope of DevNet 2.

100
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.000
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

101
00:19:22.150 --> 00:19:31.380
Parithosh Jayanthi: Thank you. And the next one is proven merge spec changes for EIP7708.

102
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:39.510
Parithosh Jayanthi: I see Ben's been digging into this one. Do you want to give us some context, Ben?

103
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.770
Ben Adams: Oh, okay, yeah, so… This would be…

104
00:19:54.230 --> 00:20:00.260
Ben Adams: Any non-zero transfer that's not included in… already in a different field?

105
00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:01.380
Ben Adams: of ETH.

106
00:20:01.650 --> 00:20:07.900
Ben Adams: So, for instance, paying gas,

107
00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:11.709
Ben Adams: It's already included in the transaction, which is…

108
00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:15.599
Ben Adams: why I said there's a little bit of conflict if we lose that information.

109
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:20.479
Ben Adams: Then we emit a… we emit an ETH transfer log.

110
00:20:21.450 --> 00:20:23.980
Ben Adams: So that you can… you can build…

111
00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:29.919
Ben Adams: The state of an account just from looking at logs, withdrawals.

112
00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:40.560
Ben Adams: And transactions without having to, previously, I think you have to debug trace work out ETH transfers.

113
00:20:47.650 --> 00:20:54.460
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, got it. Has everyone gotten a chance to look at this PR, or not yet?

114
00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:56.799
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Spencer?

115
00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.310
spencer-tb: Hey, yeah, I just, I guess…

116
00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:02.720
spencer-tb: I linked it in the comment, just, so I think as the…

117
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:11.400
spencer-tb: PR aspect right now, and we're using… The forced…

118
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:15.370
spencer-tb: 478… 4788, address, system address?

119
00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:21.149
spencer-tb: I guess I just want to confirm that everyone's okay with using that address.

120
00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.890
spencer-tb: in the PR,

121
00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.170
spencer-tb: Yeah, and then if that's the case, then I guess we go with it. Also, I think initially this PR included

122
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.540
spencer-tb: few receipts and withdrawals as well, not just ETH transfers. So this…

123
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:44.889
spencer-tb: This PR… yeah, it's only for ETH transfers, and I believe ETAN moved a few receipts and withdrawals to a separate PR.

124
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.279
spencer-tb: Yeah, so if everyone's okay with that, then I guess we can just stick to that as the spec for DemNet 2.

125
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.500
Parithosh Jayanthi: But…

126
00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:05.270
Ben Adams: on the… on the address specifically, an opinion that's not strongly held is, I'd prefer the address

127
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:07.339
Ben Adams: to be… zeros.

128
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:11.420
Ben Adams: Because it's not, it's not a…

129
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.210
Ben Adams: The one currently chosen is… this is the system.

130
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:22.400
Ben Adams: Whereas we're talking about ETH, the asset, which the zero address seems more appropriate for.

131
00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.660
Ben Adams: Rather than the system.

132
00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:34.959
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think there's a comment here explaining the three options, right?

133
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:51.719
Ben Adams: Yeah, so zero… system address, and… Eip788.

134
00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:54.429
Parithosh Jayanthi: Got it.

135
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.989
Parithosh Jayanthi: Does… has any… Client team, et cetera, had a strong opinion over here?

136
00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:19.850
spencer-tb: Maybe we stick to system address, and if we want to change it in the future, we can do that. Just for Definitely.

137
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:30.109
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think that sounds reasonable. Let's stick to system address then, and we can still discuss on the PR, what to do.

138
00:23:31.290 --> 00:23:36.730
Ben Adams: Could we have these PRs merged so that the… Correct.

139
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.539
Ben Adams: put emphasis on that, so that the,

140
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.180
Ben Adams: We can follow along with what's canonical.

141
00:23:46.530 --> 00:23:48.790
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yep, sounds good. I'll write that down.

142
00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:54.030
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

143
00:23:54.360 --> 00:24:06.390
Parithosh Jayanthi: The next point that, Spencer brought up was, a few EALS PRs for visibility. Is there any PR here worth discussing, Spencer, or are you.

144
00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.080
spencer-tb: You're located.

145
00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.500
Parithosh Jayanthi: Just flag it in the comment.

146
00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.090
spencer-tb: No discussion here, just wanted to flag it for visibility, yeah. Sorry.

147
00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:20.439
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, that sounds good. And I guess, based on the decisions on the call, you guys would just merge in the required PRs, and we should be good to go?

148
00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.100
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay,

149
00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:44.689
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, that sounds good. The next topic on the agenda was, Amsterdam ETBS DevNet update. Do we have anything from the CL client teams? How close are we to the DevNet?

150
00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:46.469
Parithosh Jayanthi: How are things looking?

151
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.759
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Jen?

152
00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:59.750
Jen: Sorry, just before we move on, can we just reiterate what is the final definite 2 scope, and when are the timelines, and what is missing?

153
00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:16.670
Parithosh Jayanthi: Got it. So for DevNet 2, we're gonna be, keeping 7843, along with both the changes that are, included in Spencer's comment. I'll link the comment, in chat here.

154
00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:35.989
Parithosh Jayanthi: We're going to be, moving the 8024 discussion to later, so that it's not being included in DevNet2 scope, and would be included in DevNet 3 scope. 7778 is going to be, included along with Tony's changes, so it'll be merged.

155
00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:46.259
Parithosh Jayanthi: Eip7708, we merge in the PR as is, and we still have to discuss the, the address, and that can be done later and updated in DevNet 3 if required.

156
00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.819
Parithosh Jayanthi: As per our timeline, Stefan, did you have an idea on when you wanted DevNet 2 up and running?

157
00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:11.680
Stefan Starflinger: I think it would be great if we could get all these PRs merged as quickly as possible. I think I will have everything ready to launch DevNet 2 around Wednesday, but I can set the gloss fork for a little bit later.

158
00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:24.289
Stefan Starflinger: So hopefully this week, we should be able to launch DevNet 2. It will be good to be ready by Wednesday… Thursday by the latest. That would be very nice.

159
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.310
Stefan Starflinger: But if, clients need more time, it would be great if they could reach out to me.

160
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:40.950
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, sounds good. If… and Clancy, the moment you have, images ready, then please just ping Stefan, and you can already have, local governments.

161
00:26:44.330 --> 00:26:56.319
Parithosh Jayanthi: And Lucas has a question for 770H. Does it behave the same as each simulate? I would… Spencer, would you be able to take that question?

162
00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:03.230
spencer-tb: Yeah, no, sorry, I'm not sure.

163
00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:07.819
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, then we might have to discuss that later, Lukash.

164
00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.969
Parithosh Jayanthi: I'm not sure if I have downside.

165
00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:24.729
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, next item on the agenda was, Glamsterdam EPBS DevNet update, and POTUS has a comment. Do you want to speak up, Potos, or…

166
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.209
Parithosh Jayanthi: How do we want to do this?

167
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:41.919
Potuz: Oh, it's just that comment. We… it looks like the spec is finally frozen, at least in what regards to test vectors. Terence has, at least on Prism, opened most of the, local processing of blocks.

168
00:27:42.830 --> 00:27:55.049
Potuz: and… and all of the gossip, objects, we are reviewing them. We should merge those PRs in the next 2-3 days. Still, like, all of the periphery of the… of the…

169
00:27:55.050 --> 00:28:05.919
Potuz: pull request needs to be developed. It will take more time to talk about Kurtosis runs, but at least the processing and the spec tests are going to be passing in the next 2-3 days.

170
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:16.080
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, do we have any other client teams? Cl teams… Phil, do you want to go for Lodestar?

171
00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.170
Parithosh Jayanthi: Nico.

172
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:30.980
Matthew Keil: I apologize, can you ask that question? Oh, go ahead, Nico.

173
00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:39.740
nflaig: So, we have a few PRs open for fork choice, gossip changes, and there's still some work to do for DevNet.

174
00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:43.870
nflaig: But yeah, it's looking to get pretty complete now.

175
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.720
nflaig: But yeah, we are still a bit far.

176
00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:49.790
nflaig: I think for the definite itself.

177
00:28:52.450 --> 00:28:55.780
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, Dustin, do you want to go for Nimbus?

178
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:05.929
Dustin: Sure, so we've had… For… for a while, the… We're up to date on…

179
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:11.960
Dustin: Alpha.1 specs, with, with a couple of…

180
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:17.210
Dustin: With the fork choice proposal boost quirk aside, we haven't updated for that, but…

181
00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:22.319
Dustin: For, for all the, sort of, EPBS, let's say, specific things.

182
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:31.200
Dustin: The… Otherwise, I think we're… we're missing… We're missing block…

183
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:38.080
Dustin: Production, we're missing a couple of other things, I… yeah, it's not…

184
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:49.480
Dustin: We're, we're getting there, but yeah, I would say we're… well, what was the phrase? A bit… a bit far? No, I mean, yeah, we're not… we couldn't do it in the next…

185
00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:54.130
Dustin: Or so, for sure. Yeah.

186
00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.729
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, photos?

187
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:13.389
Potuz: Yeah, I wanted to reply to a question that Marius has asked about timings. I speak for myself, but I always suspected that the timings on the PBS were only going to be chosen

188
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:26.800
Potuz: much, much further down the line, when we actually get some testing on more than just a local DevNet, but a decentralized one, so that we can actually measure what are the tightests that we can make.

189
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.760
Potuz: In particular.

190
00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:43.489
Potuz: At the station deadline, we would want to make it as soon as possible. There is a PR that Francesco opened to make the payload availability deadline variable, depending on the size of the payload, and it seems that that's going to be merged.

191
00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:51.330
Potuz: that, that PR also adds a new constant, which is What is the minimum?

192
00:30:51.500 --> 00:31:02.880
Potuz: time that, like, a zero-size payload should have, and that, I think, also should be decided after we decide the attestation deadline, the tightest as possible.

193
00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:13.180
Potuz: And then there's the problem of when the PTC deadline would be, that that will depend, I think, on the severity of the free option problem.

194
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.589
Potuz: And the blob count that we hit to target on Gloas, of course.

195
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:28.940
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, so for Francesco's PR and the variable PTC deadline, I think that's a much bigger topic, and probably more appropriate for ACDC later this week.

196
00:31:29.210 --> 00:31:37.139
Parithosh Jayanthi: But yeah, I wanted to continue with, DevNet updates. Solius, do you want to go for, Grandine?

197
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.790
saulius: Okay, so… Mmm…

198
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:58.200
saulius: I think we are still missing some, some stuff, and I actually need to check, again with, Hanglang what is the very latest status, on,

199
00:31:59.470 --> 00:32:06.259
saulius: on this, on QC PBAS implementation. So yeah, as far as I know, we are still missing something.

200
00:32:08.610 --> 00:32:12.530
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, do we have anyone from TECU?

201
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:15.760
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Enrico?

202
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.400
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yes?

203
00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:22.939
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So we merged, the…

204
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:36.790
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): franchise change to… related to the proposed boost change that recently has been updated. We are surpassing Alpha01 things, testing, and

205
00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:50.460
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But there are still pending, PRs related to gossiper rules validations. It needs to be… Updated… And,

206
00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:58.760
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And there is still some work to do around, storage side?

207
00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.159
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): and, what else?

208
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.279
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Give him one sec, but… Yes, we… there is still,

209
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:20.969
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): there is an open PR, but should be completed, about the non-validating builder's change.

210
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:30.710
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But, yeah, I don't think we are that close to having a… a definite… Ready client.

211
00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:31.880
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): At the moment.

212
00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:37.870
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, and what about Lighthouse? Do we have anyone from the Lighthouse team?

213
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:50.509
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay,

214
00:33:50.620 --> 00:34:05.079
Parithosh Jayanthi: If this is the case, then do we want to set a deadline for at least local kurtosis networks? Because I think at least having a timeline would help us scope the network and start working towards DevNet ID releases.

215
00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:12.079
Parithosh Jayanthi: Do we want to aim for the end of the month for at least a kurtosis network with more than two clients?

216
00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:21.350
Parithosh Jayanthi: Does that sound achievable? Prism seems to be the farthest ahead, is that… Okay.

217
00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:25.889
Parithosh Jayanthi: Photos says 11 days is not gonna be possible for Prism.

218
00:34:30.239 --> 00:34:33.539
Parithosh Jayanthi: What timeline would be reasonable for PRISM?

219
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.269
Parithosh Jayanthi: Or for, for the CLs in general.

220
00:34:42.199 --> 00:34:44.619
Potuz: Yeah, I don't think Prism is the farthest ahead.

221
00:34:44.839 --> 00:34:48.849
Potuz: And also, don't know about timelines.

222
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:57.709
Matthew Keil: We also don't have an estimate on timelines, but it's… A few weeks, probably.

223
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:00.820
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

224
00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:16.159
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, I think we're definitely gonna have to decide at least scoping or some sort of thing for at least local devnets, because if it's gonna take a month to even have the first local DevNet, that's extremely long.

225
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:20.530
Parithosh Jayanthi: Especially because we still have changes coming in, and we haven't even started testing.

226
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:29.209
Parithosh Jayanthi: But yeah, we… I guess we'll parallelly start working on a testing roadmap and see where we can merge the two in.

227
00:35:32.050 --> 00:35:51.870
Matthew Keil: So, I don't know if it's worth bringing up again, because I'm not sure, how things have been built, but if it's possible, where we can break the EPBS scope into pieces, I don't know, again, I know POTUS had, we had talked about this, and it's difficult, but if we could do, like, slot restructuring, and then do the…

228
00:35:52.090 --> 00:35:57.729
Matthew Keil: some of the other scopes, in a second phase. Just a thought.

229
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:16.570
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, maybe we can add this as an agenda item for Thursday's ACDC as well, because I do think ACD is gonna have opinions on at least some sort of timeline.

230
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:23.730
Parithosh Jayanthi: But yeah, I agree with Dustin, it might add more complexity than it's worth, so at least we have to discuss it and decide.

231
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:32.159
Potuz: It's kind of irrelevant for this, right? So there's no… there's no trustless payments on…

232
00:36:32.970 --> 00:36:37.709
Potuz: on the DevNet. There's not even builders, there's not even external builders on the DevNet.

233
00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:40.879
Potuz: It's just self-building for the DevNet.

234
00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:50.329
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, well, on the DevNet, you can have external builders if you want, but…

235
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:51.250
Potuz: No, we…

236
00:36:51.250 --> 00:36:51.569
Parithosh Jayanthi: the need.

237
00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:52.080
Potuz: we agreed.

238
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:53.800
Matthew Keil: No, I don't think we should.

239
00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.290
Potuz: Yeah, we.

240
00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:55.130
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yay, we don't have…

241
00:36:55.130 --> 00:37:01.530
Potuz: There's not going to be any external builders, there's not going to be even a P2P broadcast of bids.

242
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:02.760
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

243
00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:07.859
Parithosh Jayanthi: That sounds good as scoping, for sure, yeah.

244
00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:21.570
Matthew Keil: Yeah, and I don't necessarily know where to break it, I'm just thinking outside the box of a way in order to try to get it piece-a-meal. I just don't know from implementation specifics, like, it would be a challenge for us to do it, but I'm just kind of… who's your thought.

245
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:35.819
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think we might need to also update the specs page with these caveats, but we can do that after the call.

246
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:52.570
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, just to summarize the DevNet discussion before we move on to the next topic then, for Glamsterdam, EIP78437778

247
00:37:52.710 --> 00:38:02.339
Parithosh Jayanthi: 7708 are included in DevNet 2, along with all of the changes proposed. EIP8024, the EIP is included in the DevNet.

248
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:12.099
Parithosh Jayanthi: Just that the changes are not being included in the DevNet as proposed. Just wanted to clarify that because I might have misspoken earlier, but yeah.

249
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:28.240
Parithosh Jayanthi: And for EPBS, we'll update the specs page and TBD on a date, but we should try to have at least a local version of the DevNet up and running so we can start testing, and then the testing teams will get together and start making testing plan for EPBS.

250
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.749
Parithosh Jayanthi: Any open questions for Glamsterdam?

251
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.850
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay.

252
00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:49.280
Parithosh Jayanthi: Then I would hand over to Anskar, because he wants to, continue the discussion from ACD last week on EIP8037.

253
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.650
Parithosh Jayanthi: You have the floor answer.

254
00:38:53.070 --> 00:38:55.150
Ansgar Dietrichs: Perfect, can everyone hear me?

255
00:38:57.370 --> 00:39:21.039
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, well, I assume so. Yeah, so basically, we more or less finished glumpstump scoping on last ACDE. There was one last decision that we wanted to postpone to today, and that specifically is about, EIP 8037, so, our specific strategy for state growth in

256
00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:45.890
Ansgar Dietrichs: Glamsterdam, and just to basically remind people, basically, the EIP, as it was proposed by the champions, on, Thursday, basically has two elements to it. One of them is this mechanism that, dynamically adjusts, the state growth pricing based on the gas limit, so that means that instead of a

257
00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:53.260
Ansgar Dietrichs: one time, probably pretty, severe, repricing right at the, the hard fork. It basically just…

258
00:39:53.280 --> 00:40:16.030
Ansgar Dietrichs: grows together with the gas limit, so if we over time increase the gas limit, there would be… the state growth operations would become more and more expensive over time. So that's the element one, this dynamic pricing, and then the element two is this, separate metering for, state growth gas, and that specifically, was meant to address this.

259
00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:20.599
Ansgar Dietrichs: The issue of contract deployments, and the maximum per transaction.

260
00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:36.399
Ansgar Dietrichs: gas cap. So those are the two elements, the, the dynamic, pricing based on the gas limit, and the, the separate metering for contract, for, for, for, to enable, large contract, deployments. Yeah, and ideally we would…

261
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:48.049
Ansgar Dietrichs: then make the decision today on whether to include, CFI, the EIP, in that form, or consider alternative forms.

262
00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:56.050
Ansgar Dietrichs: I was thinking to start by handing over to Marius to basically give an update of the discussions that were happening,

263
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:59.690
Ansgar Dietrichs: Over the last few days, Marius, are you on the call?

264
00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maris?

265
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:14.840
Ansgar Dietrichs: What?

266
00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.270
Ansgar Dietrichs: I do see Marys on the call.

267
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.620
Mario Vega: Maurice, we cannot hear you. Maybe, your microphone's not working.

268
00:41:58.970 --> 00:42:00.280
Ansgar Dietrichs: We can hear you now.

269
00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:01.259
Ansgar Dietrichs: You can go ahead.

270
00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:01.800
Marius van der Wijden: Okay.

271
00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:17.040
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, so, sorry about that. I, over the weekend, I wrote an explainer about 8037, and why we think it's the best solution, for the network right now in order to increase the gas limit.

272
00:42:17.550 --> 00:42:24.190
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I don't know if the problem with my microphone is,

273
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:32.449
Marius van der Wijden: because of my microphone, or because the person… because it's a person sitting in front of the computer. But anyway,

274
00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:49.639
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, so if there are any questions, I'm happy to answer, questions about the… about the EIP. I think we feel very strongly that, this is necessary to ship in Glamsterdam, otherwise we cannot

275
00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.159
Marius van der Wijden: Significantly, increased the gas limit.

276
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:59.539
Marius van der Wijden: with the… with Bells and EPBS and… and the repricings.

277
00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:14.769
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes, we can go through the list. Amazing.

278
00:43:15.250 --> 00:43:15.880
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah.

279
00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:31.399
Ameziane Hamlat: So I raised a few questions on Discord. So for me, as it is today, EIP8037, for me, there is, like, some kind of regression compared to, to Fusaka.

280
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:40.419
Ameziane Hamlat: Because, with EIP 7825, we have this limit, of 16.7,

281
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:44.430
Ameziane Hamlat: Media and gas, so we can have multiple transactions per block.

282
00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:55.769
Ameziane Hamlat: And, with this EIP, we can have, much bigger transaction, especially if it has, create, like, like, create state,

283
00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.540
Ameziane Hamlat: inside.

284
00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:05.230
Ameziane Hamlat: And so we can go, basically up to the whole block with, with one transaction.

285
00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:14.730
Ameziane Hamlat: So, I understand that we are metering separately, compute and, and state creation, state growth.

286
00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:20.700
Ameziane Hamlat: And we still have, like, for this state, growth,

287
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:31.390
Ameziane Hamlat: op codes, especially for us as a store, we still have, like, this compute part that counts for 16.7 million, but still, at the end.

288
00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:36.579
Ameziane Hamlat: Before, we could have multiple transactions, in one block.

289
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:41.530
Ameziane Hamlat: And today, in the future, we would have only one transaction.

290
00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.800
Ameziane Hamlat: This may be…

291
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:51.170
Ameziane Hamlat: will not the worst case. Actually, I am… I don't know, because we need to, maybe, to benchmark it.

292
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:58.730
Ameziane Hamlat: But for me, this is, like, a big change in… especially with

293
00:44:59.070 --> 00:45:01.840
Ameziane Hamlat: For, for block access lists in the future.

294
00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:09.679
Ameziane Hamlat: So this is, like, the main concern I have. My understanding is that we have… we have, like,

295
00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:25.440
Ameziane Hamlat: this different metering to handle that, contract deployment, use case, with 20, 24 kilobytes. So, so for that, 18 million gas,

296
00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:38.220
Ameziane Hamlat: 18 million gas limit, transaction limit, either on the state, for example. We could imagine another gas… transaction gas limit on the state, creation part, that… that would

297
00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:49.289
Ameziane Hamlat: mitigate, that would mitigate this issue. So I wonder why we… we want to, like, we don't want to cap state, state transactions.

298
00:45:50.620 --> 00:46:07.049
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, that's, that's a good point. And, this is, and, Anska, said in the chat, any single transaction action can never be heavier to execute than the 60 million gas limit.

299
00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:13.500
Marius van der Wijden: This is true, however, it is also true that now a transaction could…

300
00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:31.789
Marius van der Wijden: Again, as before Fusaka consumed the entire block, and spent most of the block on, on state creation, and the, the result would be a single transaction that executes 16 million gas.

301
00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:39.679
Marius van der Wijden: on, on compute, and, everything else on state creation. So yes, but…

302
00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.750
Marius van der Wijden: Still, we would… we would be in the 16… 16 million…

303
00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:54.229
Marius van der Wijden: Still, we would limit this transaction by 60 million gas,

304
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:57.580
Marius van der Wijden: Limit, and this is a very…

305
00:46:57.910 --> 00:47:09.730
Marius van der Wijden: Weird corner case where someone is willing to deploy… willing to pay for a lot of gas in order to deploy, or in order to create a lot of state.

306
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:14.959
Marius van der Wijden: And, that is… there's nothing different about this.

307
00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:26.139
Marius van der Wijden: Practically than, someone right now paying a lot of gas for 5 or 6 transactions to create a lot of state.

308
00:47:26.350 --> 00:47:37.759
Marius van der Wijden: So… We can… We can, in theory, also think about adding a…

309
00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:45.369
Marius van der Wijden: So basically what this EAP also does is remove the transaction gas limit cap and move it into the EVM.

310
00:47:45.500 --> 00:48:04.709
Marius van der Wijden: And we can, we can think about reinstating that, in order to, in order to limit the amount of state creation that a single transaction, can do. That would, that would be possible. The problem there would be to…

311
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:19.099
Marius van der Wijden: what do we limit it? Like, we could limit it to 30 million gas, which would mean… which would allow, in the worst case, two transactions in the current block gas limit. The problem is if we 10x the…

312
00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.600
Marius van der Wijden: the… the…

313
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:37.670
Marius van der Wijden: the gas limit again, then we would, then we would run into this issue again that we wouldn't be able to deploy big contracts within the 30 million gas, gas limit. So, a solution for that would be to,

314
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:42.400
Marius van der Wijden: To also adjust the gas limit

315
00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:51.870
Marius van der Wijden: the… the allowed gas limit per transaction, in tandem with the block gas limit.

316
00:48:51.870 --> 00:49:04.670
Marius van der Wijden: So we could do something like, at 60 million gas, you can have, have a transaction that costs 20 million gas at 100, 120 million

317
00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.140
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, block gas limit, you can have transactions that have

318
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:14.779
Marius van der Wijden: I don't know, I cannot compute 40 million gas per transaction.

319
00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:22.560
Marius van der Wijden: So, yes, those… can,

320
00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:29.519
Marius van der Wijden: Yes, those would be, solutions to this, to this, to this

321
00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:48.050
Marius van der Wijden: problem, but again, I don't really think it's a problem, because, in the worst case, you will only be able to execute one single transaction, and that will run in exactly 16MGAS, and so the…

322
00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:57.480
Marius van der Wijden: the worst case… this will be significantly better than the worst case compute operations, and so there's no dose risk attached to it.

323
00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.160
Ansgar Dietrichs: Ben?

324
00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.549
Ben Adams: Yeah, following up on that, it does… it will create…

325
00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:16.859
Ben Adams: weird corner cases, for instance, where I'm buying a token that's new to me, new to my account.

326
00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.670
Ben Adams: That will cause state creation in New Balance.

327
00:50:21.590 --> 00:50:29.210
Ben Adams: I could be forced out of being included in the next block, because all the state has been used up.

328
00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:37.490
Ben Adams: Whereas somebody who's doing a swap Of that same token, but they already have it.

329
00:50:37.950 --> 00:50:44.870
Ben Adams: Therefore there's… there's no additional state costs. They will get included in the box, so there's… those weird corner cases.

330
00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:56.440
Ben Adams: Saying that, I'm… And for… it does solve problems, so… I think on…

331
00:50:57.360 --> 00:51:00.770
Ben Adams: In aggregate, it's… it's a net positive EIP.

332
00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:18.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and I mean, from my side, I will say that normally, I do think there's, like, some of these small details

333
00:51:18.810 --> 00:51:20.640
Ansgar Dietrichs: that I do feel like…

334
00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:35.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: would benefit from some further attention, just to figure out all these specific edge cases. Normally, there would be an argument for delaying the decision a bit more, but in this case, we just, you know, we just really need to get… make the decision. I personally think it would be fine to…

335
00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:48.749
Ansgar Dietrichs: have an EP like this, in case we end up agreeing that this is the best version of it, to just CFI it now, and keep iterating on it, and so then if, say, by a week, two weeks from now, the shape it's in is not…

336
00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:55.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: convincing for people. We can revisit this, potentially have a simpler version.

337
00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:03.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think, I think that's reasonable, it has a lot of attention right now, a lot of people that keep iterating on it, so I personally, think that's fine.

338
00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:18.269
Ansgar Dietrichs: So for today, I think my main question is basically whether people currently see the EIP as proposed as the best… the best candidate version, at least. So that we can CFI it, or whether people would basically…

339
00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:25.340
Ansgar Dietrichs: Have a preference for swapping it out today for a, A simpler version.

340
00:52:35.090 --> 00:52:35.660
Ansgar Dietrichs: Oh, yeah.

341
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:38.419
mhaas.eth: can you guys hear me?

342
00:52:39.310 --> 00:52:39.930
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yes.

343
00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:51.069
mhaas.eth: Yeah, thank you. Hi, I'm Marcus. I just wanted to say that I am actually pro the EIP8037, as it stands, and,

344
00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:55.230
mhaas.eth: I honestly think that…

345
00:52:55.420 --> 00:53:06.649
mhaas.eth: there was some questions regarding, developer UX, and I just want to say that as long as the tooling just supports this EIP, which shouldn't be that difficult.

346
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.589
mhaas.eth: I don't think it would complicate things any further.

347
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:21.850
Ansgar Dietrichs: Andrew?

348
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:31.309
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, I think it's fine to CFI this EIP, but, I would be cautious about the dynamic pricing.

349
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:43.860
Andrew Ashikhmin: I think, it might violate some assumptions of, smart contracts, existing ones, and, also, like, the, smart contracts devs,

350
00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:55.889
Andrew Ashikhmin: like, view, or picture. So I would actually go… I would fix this… the cost per state byte, and

351
00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:07.680
Andrew Ashikhmin: Instead of linking it to the gas limit, and when we decide to raise the gas limit, we can have a mini hard fork to adjust the cost per statewide.

352
00:54:10.930 --> 00:54:19.219
Ansgar Dietrichs: And just to clarify on that point, so would you prefer to see that change today, or would you, in principle, be…

353
00:54:19.410 --> 00:54:25.100
Ansgar Dietrichs: okay with, ceifying the EIP today as is, and then revisit it, or, like, over the next…

354
00:54:26.270 --> 00:54:26.809
Andrew Ashikhmin: You know, thoughts.

355
00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:28.710
Ansgar Dietrichs: Two weeks or so revisiting this question.

356
00:54:29.450 --> 00:54:33.729
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, it's fine to revisit it later. I can Cify it now, I think.

357
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:40.090
Ben Adams: I don't think we can… I don't think we can,

358
00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:46.569
Ben Adams: Do a mini hard book on gas prices, because they're… sorry, gas limit, because they're…

359
00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:52.290
Ben Adams: At the moment, at least, they're independent, and we don't choose the gas limit.

360
00:54:54.310 --> 00:54:55.590
Ben Adams: So, we couldn't…

361
00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:00.730
Ben Adams: The validators put up the gas limit, and then go, right, we've got to do a mini hard fork.

362
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:20.180
Andrew Ashikhmin: Well, there's still coordination, like, it's… the EF analysis, recommended, gas limit, so I don't see it as a big problem. We… and we have something like the BPO mini hard forks can be perhaps configurable.

363
00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:25.870
Andrew Ashikhmin: Anyway, I think this is something we can… Reiterate later.

364
00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:29.170
Ansgar Dietrichs: Maria?

365
00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:38.629
Maria Silva: Yes, I would… I would add on that point. I think we started to reach out to,

366
00:55:39.060 --> 00:55:53.369
Maria Silva: app developers and the community itself, and I think in the following weeks, we'll continue to do that to really understand the potential issues with these dynamic costs. I think if we figure out that there's no issues.

367
00:55:53.450 --> 00:55:59.610
Maria Silva: There, I don't see a reason why not doing it this way, because it seems…

368
00:55:59.770 --> 00:56:05.169
Maria Silva: Much cleaner than doing a fork every time we need to increase the…

369
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:24.619
Maria Silva: the gas limits. But so… so yeah, we'll… we'll work on understanding better the issues, and if, if we find that the majority of the… of the community thinks it's… it's… it's okay, then, would that, make sense to you, Andrew, to just keep as is?

370
00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.949
Andrew Ashikhmin: Yeah, yeah, sounds fine.

371
00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:33.669
Andrew Ashikhmin: But, I mean, it just, of course, as you say, it's very important to clarify it with the…

372
00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:37.810
Andrew Ashikhmin: Smart contract dev community, yeah.

373
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:41.339
Maria Silva: Great, will do.

374
00:56:42.610 --> 00:56:58.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, and then, one question that I had also posted in chat just now, if you want to leave a comment there or something, like, it seems like, at least right now, we're trending towards a CFI decision, but at the same time, also, people are… still have some questions or aspects that really need to be double-checked.

375
00:56:58.420 --> 00:57:13.470
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think there's been very active discussion already on the Discord. My question would just be, is it sufficient to just say that, like, in between the next calls, we are basically… we will have an async, iteration on this, or would people also maybe prefer,

376
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:21.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: Want to have a breakout call scheduled or something, so it's… in addition to the async collaboration.

377
00:57:27.830 --> 00:57:32.579
Ansgar Dietrichs: But I guess we… that can be a separate, decision.

378
00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:50.669
Marius van der Wijden: I'm, I'm, I'm happy to, I'm happy to, to have a call. We will definitely iterate over some of the points that have been discussed today, internally within DEF, and, but also we can schedule a call and…

379
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.320
Marius van der Wijden: And share our progress, and make sure we are answering the right questions.

380
00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:09.819
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, then, I think for now, then, I would say it seems like the decision would be to CFI it. I'd give one more round of opportunity for people to protest.

381
00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:14.069
Ansgar Dietrichs: But yeah, otherwise then, I think CFI-ing it, and then,

382
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:30.220
Ansgar Dietrichs: Making sure that there's good venues, both for just iterating in general, also iterating in a broader scope, and then, importantly, also, like, get feedback from app developers on topics like the disruptiveness of this dynamic mechanism, these kind of things.

383
00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:33.179
Ansgar Dietrichs: But we can… we can do all of this async.

384
00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:37.789
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, so anyone, anyone who would be opposed to a CFI today?

385
00:58:44.890 --> 00:59:02.499
Ansgar Dietrichs: Okay, then we can CFI 8037, and with that, we really, I think, have a finalized Gram Slam CFI scope, at least. Let's see how many of them will end up making it to SFI, but this is really exciting. Thank you all very much, and thanks, Pari, for letting me…

386
00:59:02.610 --> 00:59:06.450
Ansgar Dietrichs: Take some time today to get this to the finish line. Awesome.

387
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:17.050
Parithosh Jayanthi: So, thank you. I wanted to maybe continue quickly with the, with the last one or two items.

388
00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:24.729
Parithosh Jayanthi: Bharat, do you want to introduce what you're doing? I don't think we have to go into too much detail, but maybe it's useful context for everyone.

389
00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:30.889
Bharath: Yeah, yeah, for sure, I can keep it short. Just the idea is, like, with EPBS, we had conversations on,

390
00:59:31.290 --> 00:59:36.040
Bharath: on trying to, like, deprecate them as both sidecar. So, the main question that…

391
00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:52.140
Bharath: I wanted to bring up in this call is, what is the temperature check on that? What clients feel? Do they… because I understand their EPBS, the Lamsterdam folk definitely is quite complex, and will clients be able to prioritize this? And secondly.

392
00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:56.649
Bharath: If we absorb most of my boost functionality into clients.

393
00:59:57.260 --> 01:00:04.050
Bharath: I just wanna… there might be some value in specifying some aspects of it in the builder specs.

394
01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:17.490
Bharath: on the consensus specs, but I think it's better to be in the builder specs. There's some sense of, like, okay, like, for example, like, like, how a client can… how a client receives a list of builders.

395
01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:28.609
Bharath: Right? Like, in the sense… builders or relays, using them as interchangeable for now. Like, and what are the parameters you pass? Like, okay, like, each builder has their main bid, has their,

396
01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:34.809
Bharath: Like, you know, like, like, has the bid boost, and etc, parameters like that, and…

397
01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:45.820
Bharath: I generally see some value in standardizing that amongst clients and bringing into a specification, and I assume most of it will just be implementation details, like querying bits in parallel.

398
01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:49.749
Bharath: And stuff like that. But yeah, these are main… the main questions.

399
01:00:49.860 --> 01:01:06.680
Bharath: I had, number one is, like, what's a temperature check on defecating… absorbing RevBoost into clients for Glamstadam? Secondly, how much of it do we want to specify? I guess the how much of it do we want to specify in the spec? We can take it offline, but I was just curious to understand,

400
01:01:06.810 --> 01:01:15.140
Bharath: How, what client teams are thinking about, bringing in that boost functionality into the… absorbing that into clients for glamster?

401
01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.530
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, do CL teams wanna talk to that?

402
01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:41.539
Bharath: Yeah, I think Dustin raised it, like, the… is this really a spec thing? Yeah, I agree, like, a majority of things, I think it would be an implementation thing, but I was just wondering, like, is there some aspects we'd want to, like, standardize amongst clients?

403
01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.369
Bharath: But, outside that, yeah.

404
01:01:44.370 --> 01:01:45.880
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, portals.

405
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:56.599
Potuz: Yes, this was… this has been discussed extensively for over a year, and I think it's pretty clear that the Builder API

406
01:01:56.600 --> 01:02:09.339
Potuz: will have to be implemented on CL clients. We already have some ideas of what has to be signed, to whom it has to be signed. This is most of the contacting builders to get a bid.

407
01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:22.160
Potuz: And I think we were very clear from the start that CL clients themselves, vanilla CL clients themselves, should have this functionality to be able to contact a builder directly, which is one of the functionalities of MapBoost.

408
01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:34.900
Potuz: Mapboost does other things, like, for example, exchanging a blinded payload, that was signed, and this will not be implemented by clients, at least this will not be implemented by PRISM.

409
01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:47.940
Potuz: And I think this was also very clear from early on. So I don't… I mean, this thing of, like, contacting directly builders, is something that, yes, it's expected to be part of the builder API, and it should be specified.

410
01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:53.849
Bharath: Just to clarify on one thing, when you mentioned that,

411
01:02:54.510 --> 01:03:10.249
Bharath: MavBoost also does blind signing, yes, it does do blind signing today, but with EPBS, we really will not have blind signing, unless… if in some future we have an unstake builder API, but just to clarify, that's what you mean, right, when you talk about blind signing, because with EPBS, I don't see where we're gonna have blind sign.

412
01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.389
Bharath: Yeah, okay, sounds cool.

413
01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:18.650
Bharath: Oh.

414
01:03:18.650 --> 01:03:21.280
Dustin: Protas, when you talk… oh, sorry, yeah?

415
01:03:22.020 --> 01:03:23.779
Bharath: Alright, go ahead, Dustin, sorry.

416
01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:28.430
Dustin: Oh, question for Podas. When you kept talking about builders, do you mean…

417
01:03:28.530 --> 01:03:39.220
Dustin: PEPBS-type, quote-unquote, builders, or do you mean builders in a, flew when… before, Builder API context.

418
01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:46.950
Potuz: The CL client cannot distinguish from them, right? So if you contact a URL, and that URL gives you a signed bid.

419
01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.100
Potuz: from a builder, the CL doesn't really care. It trusts that.

420
01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:51.970
Dustin: Yeah, sure.

421
01:03:51.970 --> 01:04:09.889
Potuz: The endpoint returns a signed bid. As long as that interaction happens, that's fine. That endpoint could be a relay that grabs bids from other builders, and we don't care about that. So that part, of course, has to be implemented by CL clients, and we do have more or less a complete specification already set up.

422
01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:21.460
Dustin: Right, but I guess… I'm mostly confused, and I'm confused in the sense of, there's… what this current proposal, I mean, without…

423
01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:40.890
Dustin: getting too deep into the technical details, it's both lacking things that, if you really want to absorb all of what… especially talk about, like, what CommitBoost does, or, like, if you want to absorb all of that functionality, it's lacking a lot of, sort of, specification related to that. Whether that's a good idea is a different question. At the same time, like.

424
01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:46.430
Dustin: the Builder API, to talking with MedBoost.

425
01:04:46.450 --> 01:05:05.239
Dustin: uses the Builder API. MevBoost both speaks the Builder API to the relays, and also is spoken to by the Builder API by CLs. That exists today. That is a status quo, right now, for every CL. So when I… so every CL that supports MEV right now already supports the Builder API.

426
01:05:05.320 --> 01:05:17.349
Dustin: And if you're saying there's… there's no difference between, well, you know, there's the builder… builders and relays, because they… you're… of course, they can't tell the difference. If… if you want… if, you know,

427
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:28.519
Dustin: So, but at that point, what is actually being proposed here? Is it being… is it a standard for how to specify the multiplexing? Because that is it. That is the one… I mean, EPBS adds the not,

428
01:05:28.610 --> 01:05:35.390
Dustin: blinded part. But, okay. But in terms of structurally speaking, the one and only thing different

429
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:46.099
Dustin: here is… is specifying the multiplexing. And that's what… where my skepticism is… is of saying, well, look, that's, to me, just an implementation thing.

430
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:56.050
Dustin: and this was a saying critique made… I mean, doesn't mean we can't specify it at some level, but I mean, it's the same critique made by a couple of the EIPs this cycle,

431
01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:59.929
Dustin: In… on the EL side as well.

432
01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:19.540
Dustin: the max blobs, right? Has this very, a very, I mean, much simpler idea, a much simpler thing, but is it, like, that's not really spec, exactly. I mean, that's a separate argument, and this is not the time or place to get into it, but that's sort of this critique that was made of it, and that's the same critique I would make here, is that if you have the…

433
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:22.530
Dustin: Like, it's a per-client UX thing.

434
01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:32.430
Dustin: Right? Yeah. And that's… I would… I would want to be a lot of clarity about what exactly is… is this proposal getting us? Yeah.

435
01:06:33.280 --> 01:06:36.219
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Enrico, and I think we have to end after that.

436
01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:40.540
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, just a quick comment. We tend…

437
01:06:41.350 --> 01:06:56.719
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): To try to have the complexity of clients lower, so if we have something like this kind of multiplexing complexity that could be off-client, and having some intermediate

438
01:06:57.130 --> 01:07:07.679
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): software that can… does that. We see the benefit of that, because we can, yeah, lower down all the complexity, but…

439
01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:11.510
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I think, like, the point here was…

440
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:18.050
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): To support only the in-protocol builder flow, or the…

441
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:27.919
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Kind of blind signing, flow that is kind of trying to do the off… completely off-protocol bidding.

442
01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:29.810
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Going through, and…

443
01:07:30.370 --> 01:07:38.699
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I don't know if Bart was… was referring to that or not, but I agree with Podos that the current

444
01:07:39.420 --> 01:07:45.140
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Thing that clients needs to be implemented is essentially what we, what we have now.

445
01:07:45.310 --> 01:07:53.030
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): In terms of builder flow, removing completely the, the blinded thing that is just,

446
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.120
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Less complexity anyway, so…

447
01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:04.409
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, Bharat, would you be able to create maybe a thread on, consensus dev, and then you can continue the temp check there?

448
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:10.070
Bharath: Yeah, we have a thread in the… I raised it in Payload Builders, the channel. I can just, like…

449
01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:10.870
Parithosh Jayanthi: buffet.

450
01:08:10.870 --> 01:08:16.149
Bharath: I'll, yeah, I'll forward that, and, like, we can take the discussion there, but yeah, I have my thoughts. Like, we can talk.

451
01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:17.350
Parithosh Jayanthi: Sounds good.

452
01:08:17.490 --> 01:08:35.299
Parithosh Jayanthi: And, I don't think we're gonna be able to get to it, but flagging it for async discussion, there's a PR4817 that Portos and Justin wanted to discuss. We don't have time on the call, but maybe you guys can bring it up on the CL dev… consensus Dev chat as well.

453
01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:47.050
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, then that's it for today. Thanks, everyone, for coming, and sorry for going over.

454
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:51.359
jochem-brouwer: Thanks, Haul. Bye-bye.

455
01:08:51.659 --> 01:08:52.349
Stefan Starflinger: Thank you. Bye.

456
01:08:54.670 --> 01:08:55.420
Ansgar Dietrichs: Bam.
