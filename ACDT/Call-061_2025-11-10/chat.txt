00:13:13	Barnabas:	we have seen a halting issue with nimbus on fusaka-devnet-3
00:13:29	Barnabas:	they are still investigating
00:16:25	Jen:	Sorry, I joined late. For Reth, we included the bug fix in v1.9.1 which we patched on Friday https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth/releases/tag/v1.9.1

00:19:02	kasey:	I just joined - I think you are asking about prysm release?

00:21:49	Ameziane Hamlat:	You may need to include TPS as mgas/s may be even lower
00:23:42	Louis:	I think it is on Wed?
00:24:19	Francesco:	Could make sense to have another one this wednesday to go a bit beyond the overview stage, at least for some EIPs?
00:24:20	Toni Wahrstätter:	We can share the recordings
00:24:26	Louis:	On youtube

00:27:45	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "You may need to incl..."

I meant in the grafana dashboard, as by EIP-7904, the nodes should include more transactions for the same gas limit
00:30:00	spencer-tb:	Replying to "https://hive.ethpand..."

1000s should be fixed once I sort the bpo configs on start up for Amsterdam, hive config related fails, then we’ll have a truer overview on the fails.

00:35:16	Barnabas:	new bugs seems to be added
00:35:20	Barnabas:	very little bugs are fusaka related

00:35:26	spencer-tb:	Reacted to "very little bugs are..." with ➕
00:35:53	spencer-tb:	Yeh they all seem very regression related (at the EL ones)
00:36:15	Barnabas:	This is also why we have client diversity :D
00:36:21	Ben Adams:	Nethermind already hotfixed 12hrs later
00:37:01	Barnabas:	Most expensive setups will most likely be highly redundant
00:38:09	Barnabas:	just in comparison, this has been the smoothest testnet fork since the merge. 

I don’t think any of our previous forks were 100% flawless
00:38:27	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	As it should be for proper business 🙂
00:38:35	parithosh:	Smoother than the merge 😛
