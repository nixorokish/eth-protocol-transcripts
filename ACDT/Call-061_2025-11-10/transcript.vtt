00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.540
Mario Vega: Hello.

2
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:04.720
Pooja Ranjan: Hey, Mario.

3
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.410
Mario Vega: Hey, how are you doing?

4
00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.019
Pooja Ranjan: Good, good. So, I'll be helping with streaming, let me know whenever you're ready for stream. Move over.

5
00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:19.259
Mario Vega: Thank you, thank you so much.

6
00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:52.349
Mario Vega: Hi everyone, I think we can give one more minute before starting.

7
00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:54.099
Mario Vega: Give people time to join.

8
00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:55.459
Mario Vega: Thanks.

9
00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.849
Mario Vega: I think we can… we can start. I don't know, people.

10
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.229
Pooja Ranjan: We are live.

11
00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.100
Mario Vega: Thank you.

12
00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:04.079
Mario Vega: Hi everyone, welcome to ACDT number 61. Today's November 10th.

13
00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.559
Mario Vega: we have, the same, basically the same items of the agenda as every week, and I think we should just get started.

14
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:17.970
Mario Vega: Yeah, starting with Fusaka, we had BP01 activation last week.

15
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:28.199
Mario Vega: So, the first topic I wanted to discuss is whether there were any events that were significant enough that we need to discuss this week.

16
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.890
Mario Vega: Barnabas, do you know if we have,

17
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:35.369
Mario Vega: If it was a good transition?

18
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:50.039
Barnabas: We had no problems on the BPO2, but we have discovered a bug in NetherMind. Maybe someone from the NetherMind team can reach out and discuss what has happened.

19
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.949
parithosh: Do you mean a bug relating with BPO2, or the release bug?

20
00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:03.360
Barnabas: the release bug. Sorry, regarding BPO2, I think we were good.

21
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.110
Barnabas: BP01, BPO2 is the trick.

22
00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.730
Marcin Sobczak: Yeah, so…

23
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:12.470
Barnabas: So…

24
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:18.319
Marcin Sobczak: Yeah, we had, we added some bug fixes on top of,

25
00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:38.279
Marcin Sobczak: the version 1.35.0. We released 0.1 with bug fixes, but these bug fixes introduced even worse bugs, so we then reverted to… we released 0.2 version, which is on top of 0.0.

26
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:44.260
Marcin Sobczak: And we already, solved this… the bugs, which were in

27
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:49.800
Marcin Sobczak: version 0.1, but it was, like, under-tested. We just released it,

28
00:08:50.050 --> 00:09:05.289
Marcin Sobczak: It was under-tested, and, we are, we are, going to, to do a release after mainnet fork with, with, some known optimization and fixes.

29
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:16.639
Marcin Sobczak: And right now, we go with version, .2, which, we consider as, good enough, and,

30
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:27.939
Marcin Sobczak: And, more stable, and at this point, the stability is more important than having fixes of very rare bugs, etc.

31
00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:41.199
Marcin Sobczak: And, yeah, we introduced, we had a broken snap sync, because we introduced, regression in downloading block receipts.

32
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:50.790
Marcin Sobczak: And, other, code, like a consensus bug, but, yeah, it's,

33
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:54.730
Marcin Sobczak: We are going with version 2.2 now.

34
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.650
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

35
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:06.360
Mario Vega: Also, Barry mentions that there was also a red, bug. Is someone from Red in the call that would like to chime in?

36
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.950
Mario Vega: Alright, I think there's no one from Red. Do you guys know, Barry or Venomas, do you know the context on this?

37
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:42.150
parithosh: Yeah, I think the TLDR is they merged some changes that were supposed to be meant for block-level access lists, but, the changes ended up affecting the mainnet release before the fork.

38
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.719
parithosh: But I don't have any more details on the topic.

39
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:52.329
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you. Yeah, I think, I think it's basically the same thing, right? From Nevermind.

40
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.640
Mario Vega: It would be nice if I…

41
00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:05.729
Mario Vega: if we can reach out to Reth at some point to see if they're planning on making another release, just to make sure that the blog post is updated, I can… I can… I can follow up with them.

42
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.180
Mario Vega: Cool.

43
00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:14.619
Mario Vega: Anything else from… the HUDI VPO activation, or the mainnet, client release.

44
00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:15.290
parithosh: Bill.

45
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:15.920
Mario Vega: Not too sure.

46
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:36.730
parithosh: There's one more that Sam, found out, which was, Lighthouse, it's a non-consensus critical issue, but, Lighthouse is downloading the blobs from the checkpoint sync provider, rather than fetching from peer-to-peer. So, the team has mentioned that they'll fix it in a subsequent release, but it's non-consensus critical, so it's fine.

47
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.549
Mario Vega: Alright, alright, thanks. Enrico?

48
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:49.719
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Just one thing that I noticed, 15… kind of 15 minutes ago,

49
00:11:50.340 --> 00:12:00.840
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Our nodes are detecting some columns by route request via PC on mainnet at the moment. It's kind of curious to see.

50
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:08.489
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I don't know if anyone else noticed those, RPC calls at the moment.

51
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:15.399
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, nothing important, but, just, if anyone adds…

52
00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:23.089
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): It's just a curious thing, maybe some… there is some client, buggy client, doing this RPC request.

53
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.620
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Beforehand.

54
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:33.039
Mario Vega: Do you have more info on where these requests are coming from, or…

55
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.219
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): It's really…

56
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:48.419
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): 10, 15 minutes ago, I haven't dig into that, at the moment, but I don't have the peer, peer ID at the moment. I was just seeing these requests coming, coming…

57
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:52.970
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, just a curiosity.

58
00:12:55.700 --> 00:13:01.500
Mario Vega: Alright, definitely needs to be investigated. Anyone else has… Seen this?

59
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:17.759
Mario Vega: Okay, no, I think it's not recorded by anybody else,

60
00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.499
Mario Vega: But I think we should follow up on this.

61
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:31.430
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I will, write a message somewhere in Telegram or Discord, and maybe run… A thread on it.

62
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.440
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

63
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:39.420
Mario Vega: Yeah, and moving on, the next,

64
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.059
Mario Vega: There's a comment in the chat that there was a halt.

65
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:47.110
Mario Vega: From Nimbus on Fusaka 113.

66
00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:56.109
Barnabas: Yeah. I noticed that on, pretty much all Nimbus super nodes, the CL just stopped.

67
00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:04.670
Barnabas: It is not crashing, it just stops sending anything, stops receiving anything, stops logging anything, and this is with the latest minute release.

68
00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:10.100
Barnabas: So it's definitely something that they need to investigate.

69
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.149
Mario Vega: Alright, anyone from Nimbus in the call that,

70
00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:18.780
Mario Vega: Just to make sure if you are aware of this issue.

71
00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:33.600
Mario Vega: I cannot see anyone from anyone's in the call.

72
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:38.890
Mario Vega: Can… can we follow up with this on… with them on… with the Inimus team?

73
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.330
Mario Vega: Via message or some… or something?

74
00:14:43.970 --> 00:14:46.040
Barnabas: Oh, we are already talking with them.

75
00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:55.939
Mario Vega: Alright, okay, thanks. And just to say on that topic, is there any… anything else that's happening on… of DevNet, on the 3?

76
00:14:56.860 --> 00:14:57.870
Mario Vega: Currently.

77
00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:18.069
Barnabas: Yeah, a bunch of nodes, ran out of disk. I did some maintenance today, I cleaned up some databases, I reduced the number of blobs, so hopefully, we're not gonna run into the same issue, because the blob, database size was over 50030GB.

78
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:24.449
Barnabas: So we were just spamming too many blobs. I reduced it now, significantly, so hopefully…

79
00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:32.780
Barnabas: We're not gonna have machines running out of this for the next month. And we… we should consider shutting it down, once, mainnet is worked.

80
00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.950
Mario Vega: Okay. Okay, thanks. Does it mean that…

81
00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:46.039
Mario Vega: So we're spamming a lot of blobs in this network. Does it mean that we are not cleaning up correctly after the…

82
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.859
Mario Vega: The time period where they should be cleaning.

83
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:57.089
Barnabas: Not really, because, at 20 blobs per block, a 10-day period is…

84
00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.530
Barnabas: It's supposed to be around 640 gigabytes, I think.

85
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:12.710
Barnabas: And because we were spamming 20 blobs a block, it's… yeah, all the nodes slowly started to run out of disk. All the super nodes. Pull nodes had no issues.

86
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.000
Barnabas: Of course.

87
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.430
Mario Vega: Alright.

88
00:16:17.530 --> 00:16:18.919
Mario Vega: Thanks,

89
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.869
Mario Vega: Okay, anything else regarding,

90
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.960
Mario Vega: Alright, we have someone from Reth. Yand, do you mind,

91
00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.719
Mario Vega: Sharing a little bit about the, the bug that you guys hunt.

92
00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.770
Mario Vega: Last week?

93
00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:50.740
Jen: Yeah, I just added the… sorry, can you guys hear me? I had also issues with my mic. I just shared… I just shared also the release notes, so the V191.

94
00:16:50.800 --> 00:17:10.720
Jen: That should be the release for Pazaka, which includes a patch. This came in with, like, an EVM regression, as mentioned before, that was already introduced for preparation for polls. And yeah, we're taking measures to make sure we don't have any further search regressions. I've been talking to the testing team.

95
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:12.640
Jen: I'm on tests to include.

96
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:21.510
Mario Vega: Perfect, thank you. And I can see that the blog is already, updated for this, so we should be good there.

97
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.770
Jen: Thank you, Feng.

98
00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.990
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you.

99
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:39.550
Mario Vega: Alright. Anything else Fusaka-related? I think, the only remaining things are we have to investigate the… strange requests in mainnet.

100
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.810
Mario Vega: But anything else apart from that?

101
00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:49.540
Barnabas: It would be good to hear from Prism team, whether they would have a stable release this week.

102
00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.980
Barnabas: Because, right now they have a Treasury lease only for Milo.

103
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:06.509
Mario Vega: Anyone from prison that would care to shame in right now?

104
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:29.069
Mario Vega: Alright, I guess not.

105
00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:37.490
Mario Vega: Could we follow up with them on AC… I mean, it's… is it too late to follow up with them on ACDC, or…

106
00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:40.539
Mario Vega: What other avenue do we have on there?

107
00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:47.299
Barnabas: Yeah, I already reached out to them, but I got no response, so… I'm not sure where everyone is from, personally.

108
00:18:52.970 --> 00:19:00.320
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah, I think we have to maybe keep on trying to reach them. Otherwise, ACVC, I think, is the next,

109
00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:02.380
Mario Vega: A spot where we can find them.

110
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.580
Mario Vega: Hi, Casey, yes, exactly. We're, we're, we were wanting to hear about the Prism release.

111
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:15.070
Mario Vega: Here, you can share.

112
00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:28.830
kasey: Sure, yeah, Preston right now is, working on putting a release together, so we've been soaking over the weekend, and things are looking good, so we'll make sure to give an update in the, the Steel server. But yeah, we're looking at,

113
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:31.410
kasey: Building that out into a release as soon as possible.

114
00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:37.240
kasey: Hopefully… hopefully today. So, yeah, we'll give an update in the… in Discord.

115
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:42.129
Mario Vega: Great, thank you, thank you.

116
00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.080
Mario Vega: Okay.

117
00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:49.800
Mario Vega: Alright, anything else related to Fusaka?

118
00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:03.019
Mario Vega: Alright, if not, I think we can move to the next topic.

119
00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:05.779
Mario Vega: So 60 million gas, I think,

120
00:20:05.910 --> 00:20:11.099
Mario Vega: We already discussed in the previous weeks that all clients are ready for $60 million a minute.

121
00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:22.669
Mario Vega: So, we can basically just jump into benchmark testing. Do we have anyone from NetherMind that can update on this?

122
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.000
Marcin Sobczak: Yeah, so, we have,

123
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:36.039
Marcin Sobczak: Brantis from Nethermine and GAF with EIP7904.

124
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.479
Marcin Sobczak: And, we did some, like, initial testing, and

125
00:20:41.670 --> 00:20:50.340
Marcin Sobczak: And, yes, simply intestine benchmarks are, working as expected.

126
00:20:50.340 --> 00:21:02.380
Marcin Sobczak: And at this point, we need to generate all the new payloads to match the consensus rules after this EIP.

127
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:11.409
Marcin Sobczak: So it's our next step, and after finishing this, we will be able to run a dashboard with,

128
00:21:11.590 --> 00:21:30.420
Marcin Sobczak: with, like, instances of, standardomite, standard GAF, reprised Netheramide, and reprice GAF, and compare the results. So, like, we are at the step… at the step where, we need to generate, new…

129
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.080
Marcin Sobczak: Like, new payloads for these benchmarks.

130
00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.200
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

131
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:56.580
Mario Vega: And there was… and there's one comment, .

132
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.989
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, I can, I can give the details. So…

133
00:22:03.530 --> 00:22:10.069
Ameziane Hamlat: Testing7904, so if you keep the same dashboards,

134
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:17.259
Ameziane Hamlat: you may see, maybe a drop in the M gas per second, so I guess what could be interesting

135
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:24.330
Ameziane Hamlat: If, if you want to check the difference between, like, current schedule and…

136
00:22:24.650 --> 00:22:30.860
Ameziane Hamlat: 7904, you may need to, to include TPS, which could be, an interesting…

137
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.840
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, and at least two metrics.

138
00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:42.070
Mario Vega: Thank you.

139
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.989
Mario Vega: Okay, anybody else, that needs to shameen?

140
00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:55.780
Mario Vega: Either under repricing or benchmarking testing?

141
00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.890
Mario Vega: Alright, we also have,

142
00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:22.089
Mario Vega: a call, I think, this week, or is it next week, about gastropricing.

143
00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:26.649
Mario Vega: So please also… Let me see…

144
00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:32.520
Mario Vega: When is the next, repricing call? I think it's next week? Do we have?

145
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.960
Maria Silva: Sorry, are you… are you asking about the breakouts?

146
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.069
Mario Vega: Yeah, I mean, just generally about gastrophe.

147
00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:38.650
Maria Silva: seem very good.

148
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:39.470
Mario Vega: Yeah.

149
00:23:39.470 --> 00:23:48.109
Maria Silva: Yeah, so we had two. We had one last week and one two weeks before, and now we don't have any else planned.

150
00:23:48.670 --> 00:24:03.310
Maria Silva: because it was an overview of all the EIPs, I mean, if people find that the specific breakout or repricings would be helpful, I'm happy to schedule a few more, but with DevConnect coming, I think

151
00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.929
Maria Silva: Maybe it wouldn't make sense to do it right, right away?

152
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.260
Maria Silva: But yeah, we don't have any breakout schedule at the moment.

153
00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:21.210
Mario Vega: Excellent, okay. Yeah, yeah, I was just wondering. Thank you, thank you for chamining. Is there recordings of this, general pricing, breakout?

154
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.580
Maria Silva: There are. I'm happy to share after.

155
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.000
Mario Vega: Excellent. Thank you.

156
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.170
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah.

157
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:41.570
Mario Vega: If nothing else on gas or pricing, or estate testing, or benchmark testing, I think we can move on to Glamsterdam.

158
00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:46.549
Mario Vega: So the first topic is, lock-level access lists.

159
00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:53.470
Mario Vega: Anyone care to chime in on… Updating the current status.

160
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:04.340
Mario Vega: I think the main question is whether we are planning on launching,

161
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:06.590
Mario Vega: DevNet at the end of the month, still.

162
00:25:06.590 --> 00:25:29.500
parithosh: Yeah, so that is still the plan, and Stefan is on his way to DevConnect right now, so he can't make it, but he asked us to get two questions resolved. The first one is if the block-level access list tests are fixed, and I think Spencer is looking into it, and we might have been using the wrong release, so that's probably the cause, is…

163
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:33.839
parithosh: Yeah, Spencer, do you have any other information for that?

164
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.270
spencer-tb: Yeah, so they're… they're,

165
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:47.260
spencer-tb: Basically, the most recent block access list release, the version 1.4.0, is different from the previous releases. Basically.

166
00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:51.309
spencer-tb: Previous releases were block access list specific tests.

167
00:25:51.690 --> 00:26:02.260
spencer-tb: But this new, I guess, latest, the one that's, that needs fixed, contains the block access list specific tests, and then also…

168
00:26:02.490 --> 00:26:07.570
spencer-tb: All of our existing tests refilled full block access lists.

169
00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.639
spencer-tb: So I think, there was a…

170
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:16.989
spencer-tb: 7702-related issue, with that.

171
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:24.720
spencer-tb: release, there will be a patch for that in the next release. Also, we're running these tests right now in Hive.

172
00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:30.700
spencer-tb: And all the blood tests are failing because we need to fix the…

173
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:34.819
spencer-tb: We need to fix the, BPO-related configs.

174
00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.539
spencer-tb: On how we're starting up the clients with these tests.

175
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:42.160
spencer-tb: Anyway, I guess, just a TLDR is that…

176
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:46.029
spencer-tb: Hopefully we'll have a next… the next release either tomorrow

177
00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:53.220
spencer-tb: or the very latest on Wednesday, and we'll update… we'll update Hive as well. And yeah, these should be fixed.

178
00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.020
spencer-tb: So I think Felipe from Steel has been working on this the most, and he…

179
00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:05.009
spencer-tb: is out of office today, but he'll be back tomorrow, so, there'll be some action, for sure, either tomorrow or Wednesday.

180
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:16.920
parithosh: Perfect, thank you. And, the second thing he mentioned was that, so Spammer has a basic EVM fuzzing scenario in there now.

181
00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:27.650
parithosh: And even just running the basic spammer with, with this config in a local block-level access list network kind of makes it immediately.

182
00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:42.879
parithosh: There's an example of a failure on Nethermind. Stefan said he'll also repost the entire Kurtosis config so that clients can look into it, but it sounds like it's very brittle right now, so it would be great if we can get some fixes in and

183
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:54.850
parithosh: we're ready to launch immediately, the entire infrastructure set up. As soon as it's not as brittle, then we'll spin up the network. We were hoping to still do it on Wednesday, but I'm not sure if clients get time to fix it that soon.

184
00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:02.120
Mario Vega: Thank you. So what I can see from the results at the moment is that… so we… basically, the previous

185
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:19.530
Mario Vega: the previous releases, they did not contain other… other things that… than targeted tests, right? So what happened now is that we… we are filling every single test that we had in the repository with block-level access turned on, and now we have, basically.

186
00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:24.189
Mario Vega: 1,000 tests at the minimum failing for every client.

187
00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:28.160
Mario Vega: Something I noticed is that,

188
00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:38.190
Mario Vega: I… from debugging in the logs, in the clients, I don't see that many of them are printing the full block-level access list that they are expecting.

189
00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:51.049
Mario Vega: Right? So, I think, I don't know if this was discussed on the, on the local accesses breakout, but I think we need to make sure that all clients do print, if they find…

190
00:28:51.050 --> 00:29:02.760
Mario Vega: the block level access does not match what they were expecting. It would be nice if every single client, at least on debugging, they would bring the entire block level access, so we can easily debug and compare

191
00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.629
Mario Vega: What the test expects versus what the client expects.

192
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:13.360
Mario Vega: So yeah, that was, that was something that, I, I, wanted, I want to share.

193
00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.310
Mario Vega: Cool.

194
00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:18.180
Mario Vega: Yeah, but yeah, come in, bye.

195
00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:38.450
parithosh: It's kind of the same ask we had with the debug, bad blocks endpoint. I think there, also, the request was to have not just the block-level access list that you think is bad, but also what you generated. And I think Bezos already done this, and Jared looked into it and said he will do it for Geth. I'm not sure about NetherMind and the other clients, though.

196
00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:50.839
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, everyone will edit. This was part of the block of access list breaker call result result. At the very end, all the clients agreed to adding that.

197
00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:14.320
Mario Vega: Amazing. Thank you. And coming back to the point of the DevNets, I don't think we should launch until we get this, this number of failures on Hive to a very… to a very low number, more manageable, because we're certainly gonna find more things.

198
00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:18.130
Mario Vega: And it's gonna be, like, breaking all the time, at this point.

199
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:25.269
parithosh: Yeah, for sure. We also don't want to launch it when, like, a basic fuzzler can take it down in half a minute or something.

200
00:30:33.880 --> 00:30:34.790
Mario Vega: Alright.

201
00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:41.729
Mario Vega: Yeah, thanks, thanks for the input. Anything else on block-level access lists that we want to share in this meeting?

202
00:30:52.400 --> 00:31:05.209
Mario Vega: Okay, yeah, okay, so, and TLDR, basically just go to the Hive, Hive results page, look at your client, look at the logs, and please chime in. Also, of course, if there's anything wrong with the tests.

203
00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:14.559
Mario Vega: So if you think you are in the right, in the correct, regarding rejecting a block load access list, please also chime in, and with the, with the testing team.

204
00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:28.120
Mario Vega: either with, Felipe, Tony, or Rahul, we can, we can take a look at the test and also, also try to fix it if, if you guys, think that the test is incorrect.

205
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:35.019
Mario Vega: Alright. Good. Moving on, to ePBS,

206
00:31:35.710 --> 00:31:39.120
Mario Vega: Is there anything, anything worth of discussion today?

207
00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:54.560
Justin Traglia: I can chat for a second. Hello? We had the ePBS breakout call on Friday last week. It was pretty quick, but we discussed adding an off-protocol value field to the execution payload bid structure.

208
00:31:54.860 --> 00:32:04.889
Justin Traglia: I think the name for this is Execution Payment. We also discussed including a previous Randall field in the bid, which is necessary.

209
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:11.870
Justin Traglia: And calling, process builder payments earlier and process epoch, that's still undecided.

210
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.319
Justin Traglia: We plan to…

211
00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:21.470
Justin Traglia: Include these changes in the next spec release, maybe within, like, a week or two, and then DevNet Zero will be based on that.

212
00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:33.170
Justin Traglia: I personally don't think that DevNet Zero for EPBS will happen probably until mid-January, at the earliest, due to DevConnect and the holidays, so just keep that in mind.

213
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:39.200
Justin Traglia: I know clients are still making good progress on implementations,

214
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:47.640
Justin Traglia: And the next, breakout call, which was scheduled for, I think, November 21st, has been canceled due to DeafConnect, so…

215
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:54.940
Justin Traglia: I think the next one… was, it is December 5th.

216
00:32:56.800 --> 00:33:01.020
Justin Traglia: I don't… that's pretty much all I have, unless clients wants to give… wants to give.

217
00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.900
Justin Traglia: More detailed updates.

218
00:33:08.390 --> 00:33:11.600
Mario Vega: Thank you. Okay, any clients?

219
00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:13.750
Mario Vega: For any other updates?

220
00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:26.820
Mario Vega: Yeah, I think that was… that was basically it. Thank you, thank you, Justin, for the update.

221
00:33:27.120 --> 00:33:36.780
Mario Vega: Alright, I think that's basically the entire list of topics. The only other item in the agenda today is whether we are going to proceed or cancel with the

222
00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:47.670
Mario Vega: next two weeks of calls. The next week is a little bit easier. Basically, is that kind of week. We are… a lot of us are gonna be over there.

223
00:33:47.740 --> 00:34:00.809
Mario Vega: and discussing in person, so I don't think we should hold that meeting. The only open question is the week after that, because mainly… mainly because most people are gonna be traveling.

224
00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:11.289
Mario Vega: Some, part of the IPANDOps team are also gonna be offline the week after that. So, I'm talking about the… specifically, the…

225
00:34:11.820 --> 00:34:21.349
Mario Vega: 24 of November, the call on that. Is there any opposition on canceling that meeting? Should we… should we… or…

226
00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:24.099
Mario Vega: What's the… what's the sentiment?

227
00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:50.150
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: maybe not directly answer to this, but I think most of the… or at least a significant amount of the teams are actually experiencing some, let's say, bugs or not polished releases, and

228
00:34:50.590 --> 00:35:07.200
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: And my general question is, how do you feel… how do you feel about that? I mean, there isn't that much time left to the main it, and… well, the bugs are still there, you know?

229
00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.869
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: So… Any thoughts on this?

230
00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:37.969
parithosh: Yeah, maybe just reiterating what Barnabas is mentioning, the question is how many of these are really Fusaka-related versus could have happened in any major release. I do think…

231
00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:46.789
parithosh: For at least recent few months, we've kind of kept off on making major releases so that we can have everything merged into trunk branches, so…

232
00:35:47.030 --> 00:36:07.830
parithosh: kind of makes sense that the first release would have some issues or the other. The only thing we can hope for is we're working on a mainnet shadow fork, so that we should be able to catch a few more of them before they go live, and I think it's also expected that clients would have a hotfix release if they do find anything. That's also one of the reasons why we

233
00:36:07.830 --> 00:36:15.419
parithosh: Have releases about a month before the fork, so that releases can soak, we can have extensive rounds of testing and catch everything.

234
00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:23.439
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: I'm… I'm just wondering, maybe there is some statistic on, how…

235
00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:37.410
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Much of, like, these large, stakers or, or staking entities, have a redundant, setups, because just for example,

236
00:36:38.170 --> 00:36:47.340
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: data that was a bit nether mind on Hudi. At least on my instance, I needed to resync, the EL, so…

237
00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.650
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: So, I mean, if we…

238
00:36:49.860 --> 00:37:06.079
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: if the setups are highly redundant, in terms of, you know, multiple clients are used by the same staker, redundant setups, then I think these, these releases that, has, some issues, like we…

239
00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:18.220
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: have now. Maybe it's not a big problem, but if the setups are not that redundant and are not that diversified, then

240
00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:26.719
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: There could be some turbulence after the hard work, at least based on the issues that we have now.

241
00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:41.020
parithosh: Yeah, for sure. We don't have exact numbers from everyone running every validator on mainnet, but at least for large staking pools, they tend to have a backup beaker node that they can fail over to.

242
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:52.839
parithosh: A lot of them use a testint vouch slash similar style of middleware proxies, where if there is a failure in one node, you can define a strategy to failover to a different node.

243
00:37:52.950 --> 00:38:01.990
parithosh: And there's also SSV and OBOL-style clients on mainnet, so I don't think the answer is 100% redundant, but it's not 0%.

244
00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:10.229
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Okay, sounds good then. Likely these issues will be covered by these redundant setups.

245
00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:20.610
Mario Vega: Alright, and one comment from Barnum is that this is…

246
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:25.099
Mario Vega: One of the smoothest test networks since the March.

247
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:35.330
Barnabas: Yeah, I think so. Like, we had many forks since the merge, and every single,

248
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:45.179
Barnabas: or had some kind of bug here or there. I think Flipica has been one of the most stable since, since we started forking the testimonets.

249
00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.210
Barnabas: Yeah, smoother than actual merger as well.

250
00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:54.430
Mario Vega: Alright.

251
00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.740
Barnabas: Yeah, I don't think there's much to worry about, to be honest.

252
00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:12.650
Mario Vega: Any other concerns that, or opinions from other clients?

253
00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:24.170
Mario Vega: Never mind, I mean, or Reth, did you guys, experience the, the issues? If you want to share anything, or…

254
00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.170
Ben Adams: Yeah, we…

255
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:35.789
Ben Adams: We released a fix for it, like, 12 hours after the release. We were a little bit ambitious in the

256
00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:40.939
Ben Adams: What we included in the, in that initial release.

257
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:47.129
Ben Adams: But yeah, it's fixed now, and we're… we're being a bit more cautious.

258
00:39:50.600 --> 00:40:04.800
parithosh: Maybe a follow-up question is, we do still have some testing bandwidth now that the releases are shipped. We are focusing on Shadow Fork, and then making sure that there are no high failures, but are there any other angles or…

259
00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:11.570
parithosh: Specific things that we should be looking at that client teams are worried about, because we can then try to prioritize that over the next weeks.

260
00:40:16.970 --> 00:40:20.299
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Do you guys do a non-finality testing?

261
00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:22.430
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: On a larger network.

262
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:28.099
parithosh: Do you mean the, like we had in September?

263
00:40:28.450 --> 00:40:33.030
parithosh: We did an opportunity test round then, but we haven't repeated that right now.

264
00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:40.980
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Yeah, I think it would be valuable to have a… Last time, just before the…

265
00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.420
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Before the hard work on the mainnet.

266
00:40:46.980 --> 00:40:52.180
parithosh: Okay, I think we can plan that in for after DevConnect in that case.

267
00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:54.809
parithosh: Yeah, we will discuss that and get back to you.

268
00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:56.460
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Great, thanks.

269
00:40:57.510 --> 00:41:12.059
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, I have a question. We probably do have it somewhere, but, some stats for when hammering blobs for post-peer DAS in terms of, like, blob pull. Do we have that… confirm that everything is fine there?

270
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:32.300
parithosh: Yeah, Sam's been looking into that, and hasn't found anything worth surfacing right now, but part of the problem is the blobs kind of originate from us, because we're doing the spamming, so it's hard to tell if there's a bug that is hidden, because we're basically reusing testnet infrastructure.

271
00:41:54.330 --> 00:42:03.610
Mario Vega: Oh, I think, I think, going to Lucas' question, do you, do you guys have, like, any dashboard where we can… I mean, is there, is there anything worth, like…

272
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:10.790
Mario Vega: Or is this internal, and you only surface if you find any bugs, or do you have, like, public metrics, or…

273
00:42:11.060 --> 00:42:18.119
parithosh: It… mostly just ZATU dataset data. We can share something, but…

274
00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:21.840
parithosh: Yeah, the question is, like, what we're looking for.

275
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:28.509
Łukasz Rozmej: So my, my question was mostly about performance degradation, or, like,

276
00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:36.940
Łukasz Rozmej: Starvation, or… bandwidth starvation, or latency spiking, things like that.

277
00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:44.010
Łukasz Rozmej: Because of just the high memory… high bandwidth usage of blobs per post-Fusaka, and mempool.

278
00:42:44.010 --> 00:42:51.850
parithosh: Okay, so, so, okay, got it. I think the Sunnyside Labs has some dashboards for that. We can, share that, yeah.

279
00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:02.390
Mario Vega: Awesome.

280
00:43:02.550 --> 00:43:10.660
Mario Vega: Alright, any other concerns from Clintense? Regarding current status?

281
00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:35.159
Mario Vega: And there's a question from Casey about, private blobs and rear-heavy situations.

282
00:43:36.030 --> 00:43:42.339
Barnabas: We also didn't notice any issues with private blobs. We did many tests, when…

283
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:51.140
Barnabas: The relay was the only one seeing the blobs, and no other nodes were able to use, get blob V2.

284
00:43:51.510 --> 00:44:01.300
Barnabas: So… We didn't see any issues with that. Rear communications might cause issues, with some specific ER clients.

285
00:44:02.170 --> 00:44:03.840
Barnabas: I'm not sure if…

286
00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:16.160
Barnabas: we have fixed all of that. I remember Netherland had the pre-org issues, they push out fixes. We haven't had a non-finity test since

287
00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:24.409
Barnabas: I would say maybe a month and a half now, so… yeah, we can definitely redo that on Devon Street.

288
00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:41.980
kasey: Yeah, and if I can jump in, one concern I have on the CL is that when we reorg, you know, we exercise some pending block queue code paths that are not usually really, exercised in tests that don't have these reorgs, so, you know, we have

289
00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:56.169
kasey: a missed, block, not only do we need to get the block, now we need to go get, like, a super node might need to get 128, column sidecars, you know, and that can just put a lot more strain on the node. So I think that would be… if we have a way to test that in.

290
00:44:56.170 --> 00:45:07.260
kasey: some of the testnets, that would be good. And, and for the private blobs, I'm wondering, are we… are we continuing to test that, like, as we go through, like, Hoodie and so forth?

291
00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.440
Barnabas: We are not. We're doing only on DevNet 3. We don't…

292
00:45:15.610 --> 00:45:20.290
Barnabas: Basically, participate on testnet, manipulating testnet data.

293
00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:28.820
Barnabas: We don't run any relays, so this would be up to the relay operators to submit private transactions, and

294
00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:32.829
Barnabas: Yeah, I mean, they… they might have already done it,

295
00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.579
Barnabas: We do not have control over those.

296
00:45:36.450 --> 00:45:37.200
kasey: Gotcha.

297
00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:46.580
Mario Vega: So if I… sorry. Yeah, go ahead, Praszh, sorry.

298
00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:53.950
parithosh: There was, one more, bug that we were talking about, relays and, map boosts in itself.

299
00:45:53.950 --> 00:46:11.859
parithosh: I've posted it here, Bharat, along with the new construct folks, dug into this. The issue was that if you have multiple, relays configured, then the… there's a race condition. It's now been fixed, and there should be a release soon. But yeah, just keep an eye out for that one.

300
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:28.200
Mario Vega: Okay, thanks. Just going back to the question of non-finality, are we doing that on DevNetri? At some point, it was at the consensus?

301
00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.700
Barnabas: Oh, we can do that, yeah. We can redo another one.

302
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:32.610
Mario Vega: Alright.

303
00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:35.730
Barnabas: I would just ideally want to have the numbers bug,

304
00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.099
Barnabas: Figured out before we trigger an infinity.

305
00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:48.780
Barnabas: Because as far as I know, that's the only place where Nimbus has detected issues with this.

306
00:46:51.530 --> 00:47:03.379
Mario Vega: Alright, for sure, yeah, yeah, okay, so we wait until it's… that one's fixed. If we already reach out to Nimbus, I think we should be fine, and then we try to trigger the non-finality.

307
00:47:03.910 --> 00:47:05.410
Mario Vega: Dimensory. Perfect.

308
00:47:06.990 --> 00:47:07.910
Mario Vega: Alright.

309
00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.869
Mario Vega: Any other comments from client teams?

310
00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:29.959
Mario Vega: Alright, if not, going back to the original question, so do we keep… The column 24…

311
00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:32.919
Mario Vega: For a CDT, or do we cancel? Is that…

312
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:40.319
Mario Vega: Or should we leave it open? Maybe you can leave it open and come back to it, and…

313
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:21.060
Mario Vega: Alright, there's, boarding right now, do we cancel or keep it? It seems like… Alright.

314
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:26.579
Mario Vega: Yeah, it seems like we have to… we… we are leaning towards cancel, so…

315
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:38.819
Mario Vega: Yeah, let's just cancel. So, just to summarize, the week of the… sorry, the call of the 17th is going to be canceled, and the call of the 24 is also going to be canceled.

316
00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:44.330
Mario Vega: We are back on, December 1st, for ACDT.

317
00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:48.420
Mario Vega: Alright.

318
00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:52.350
Mario Vega: Good. Any other thoughts?

319
00:48:52.740 --> 00:48:58.029
Mario Vega: On, on… that need to be discussed today, or… because that's everything in the agenda for today.

320
00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:10.220
Mario Vega: Alright, if not, I think we can, we can, we can end it here.

321
00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:18.280
Mario Vega: Thanks everyone for joining. See you on… One… one raised hand. Casey, do you have last comments?

322
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:27.100
kasey: Yeah, I just… since I said before that I would follow up on the Prism release, I did hear from Preston that, he is planning on getting the release out today, so I think we can't expect that to be done today.

323
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:31.250
kasey: That's it.

324
00:49:31.250 --> 00:49:32.950
Mario Vega: Excellent, thank you so much.

325
00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:40.570
Mario Vega: Alright, thanks everyone, and thanks for joining, and see you in DevConite, or hear you in, on December 1st.

326
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:42.499
Mario Vega: Goodbye. Thank you.

327
00:49:42.910 --> 00:49:44.310
Antoine James: Thanks, everyone. Bye-bye.

328
00:49:44.730 --> 00:49:45.680
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.

329
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.220
Marius van der Wijden: What?

330
00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:48.779
Louis: Thank you.
