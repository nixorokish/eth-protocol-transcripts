00:44:53	Francesco:	(Specifically because it’s just not enough for the CL propagation path to work for supernodes, we know it needs more bandwidth than 100/50, even in theory)
00:48:28	Francesco:	Do we need this to work? I think it would also be ok to just say that if no one can serve you your columns, you can’t sync
00:49:06	Barnabas:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

so basically we accept that nobody can reconstruct?
00:49:13	Barnabas:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

so whats the point of having 128 columns at all?
00:49:17	Manu:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

I will be definitely more confident if this perfect peerdas sync works.
00:49:19	Barnabas:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

we could just do 64 columns, and call it a day
00:49:26	Francesco:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

There are no supernodes in this devnet
00:49:38	Francesco:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

Supernodes would reconstruct
00:50:08	Barnabas:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

we haven’t verified that either yet
00:50:27	Manu:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

The main issue I see if we don’t do that is:
A full node will sync
A node with validators won’t sync
00:50:45	Parithosh Jayanthi:	We also don’t have to ship fusaka releases with support for 72 out of the gate
00:50:55	Agnish Ghosh:	exactly
00:50:59	Parithosh Jayanthi:	We could do these things later and then decide the bpo to go that high

00:51:07	Agnish Ghosh:	Replying to "We could do these th..."

I agree
00:51:12	Manu:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

The question is not “is there enough super nodes in the network” but “is there enough super nodes in OUR peers"
00:52:24	Francesco:	Well, you don’t need supernodes in your peers, you just need someone that has your columns
00:52:52	Manu:	That’s true.
00:53:03	Agnish Ghosh:	Reacted to "Well, you don’t need..." with 👍
00:53:04	Francesco:	Another way to say it would be: do you need to be able to sync if you can’t find any subnet peers? How would you even stay on the network without subnet peers?
00:53:08	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "Do we need this to w..."

i think yes. it gives us better load distribution when resolving non-finality

00:53:37	Agnish Ghosh:	Replying to "We could do these th..."

Right we scale upto 20 blobs, it’d be nice to scale upto 30+ blobs for Fusaka? 72 is insanely aggressive imo

00:54:54	Raúl Kripalani:	isn't this a scheduling problem? i.e. if clients can do this reconstruction during idle time, it seems worth it

00:55:55	Minhyuk Kim:	Reacted to "isn't this a schedul..." with 👍
00:56:12	Manu:	2 different issues
00:56:14	Francesco:	Yeah it’s not related to blob throughput
00:56:24	Agnish Ghosh:	Different issues
00:56:52	Raúl Kripalani:	yeah this is an issue about resilience / functional guarantees of DAS

00:57:03	Manu:	Reacted to "yeah this is an issu..." with 👍🏼
00:57:05	Barnabas:	Reacted to "yeah this is an issu..." with 👍🏼
00:57:31	Francesco:	To be clear, I am not saying this is useless (though I haven’t thought through exactly how much it helps in general), just wondering if we need all clients to implement it before Fusaka
00:57:33	Manu:	I wish we do not need this feature.
But I prefer to be prepared in case we need it...
00:57:47	Minhyuk Kim:	In larger networks like mainnet, is it highly(or enough) likely that a syncing full node will reliably hit a peer which custodies a column  identical to itself? Given the larger number of available peers and supernodes?
00:57:53	Barnabas:	I agree on Francesco that its not a must have during finality, but during non finality, we might have some non finality scenarios where we do need this feature
00:58:12	Agnish Ghosh:	Replying to "I agree on Francesco..."

We definitely need this feature
00:58:20	Manu:	Prysm: ETA end of week
00:58:27	Barnabas:	Reacted to "Prysm: ETA end of we..." with 🔥
00:58:41	Raúl Kripalani:	i think this is part of the broader topic of reconstruction (and which scenarios trigger it and when)
00:58:47	Francesco:	Fwiw it’s not obvious to me that this isn’t going to end up causing problems because all of a sudden everyone is requesting way more columns than they normally do
00:59:03	Agnish Ghosh:	We do we use this feature at times, for short range syncing, and sometimes even while gossip
00:59:06	Francesco:	Replying to "Fwiw it’s not obviou..."

e.g. network has issues, and then they are compounded because everyone is trying to get 64 columns to reconstruct
00:59:10	Barnabas:	you would only request more columns if the requested columns are not available
00:59:23	Francesco:	Replying to "you would only reque..."

Yeah, so likely when the network is already stressed
00:59:42	Raúl Kripalani:	Replying to "Fwiw it’s not obviou..."

i'd rather hit those issues sooner to understand how clients are rate limiting column requests (and decide how to harden)
01:00:08	Minhyuk Kim:	I’m personally curious about the implementation of validator custody backfill for fusaka. Given further devnet/testnet upcoming, will it be included in future devnet requirement?
01:00:20	Agnish Ghosh:	Ideally even for gossip we gossip accept 65 columns, pass DA and reconstruct only when nimbus is the most idle through the slot, the last 3 seconds
01:00:31	pawan:	Tbh, I’m not fully convinced that this is required. Will talk about it async a bit after exploring it a bit
