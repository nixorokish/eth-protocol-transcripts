00:11:04	Barnabas:	should we signal first to 48M then to 60M ?
00:12:31	Justin Florentine (Besu):	i think a 48M step is unnecessary unless we think there are interesting network effects to learn by stopping there.
00:14:10	Toni Wahrstätter:	If it's true that the max CL size is 2.5 mib, then we can hit the 10min limit at 65m. 60m should be safe.

Yeah it was a public discussion just a bit buried in a thread in peerdas-testing, should have tagged people in the main channel

00:37:52	Justin Traglia:	Reacted to "https://github.com/e..." with 🎉
00:39:01	James He:	Replying to "Validator registrati..."

It’s actually the /eth/v1/validator/prepare_beacon_proposer  endpoint that Manu mentioned , validator registration is only builder path. We have a metric on that endpoint being called
00:39:57	kasey:	Replying to "Validator registrati..."

My mistake. I was referring to /eth/1/validator/register_validator. I thought we used the registrations created as a result of calling this, but per James this is only called when using the builder.
00:40:10	Raúl Kripalani:	i think custody groups are calculated from node ids, right?
00:40:14	Raúl Kripalani:	not from actual validators?
00:40:43	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "not from actual vali..."

That is as it initially worked, however there is a heuristic on top that says that if you have more validators you custody more
00:40:53	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "not from actual vali..."

That’s the validator custody topic we’re talking about now
00:41:23	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "not from actual vali..."
