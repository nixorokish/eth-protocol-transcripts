00:18:27	lightclient:	also still looking into this regression in the syncing bugs doc, related to our state history feature and not fusaka though
00:20:47	Łukasz Rozmej:	We could do Holesky release 
00:20:51	Roman:	have we decided on the timestamp?
00:21:05	lightclient:	plausible, but would need to discuss w team
00:21:17	Roman:	so, Thu -> Mon for release?
00:21:29	Barnabas:	too soon?
00:22:07	pawan:	We can do a rc release I think
00:22:11	Phil Ngo:	Possible. Will confirm
00:22:17	Roman:	i don’t mind, that would just be close to our current release, but this shouldn’t impact the decision to proceed quicker with the holesky fork
00:22:18	pawan:	But need to check with the rest of the team as well
00:22:35	Manu:	Have to check with the rest of the team as well
