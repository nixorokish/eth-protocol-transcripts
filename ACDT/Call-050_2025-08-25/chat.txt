00:13:31	James He:	Web3signer master branch has fulu changes ( even though the remote signer repo pr hasn’t been updated) so we can make sure to do some kurtosis testing with that soon. On remote signer support
00:13:35	Barnabas:	ufff
00:13:39	Barnabas:	yes we should have tested this
00:13:40	terence:	can we add this to spec test please?

Head slot not advancing for a while on some nodes. Client teams. Please take a look at your client pairs and let us know if you wanna do something about it.
00:20:20	stokes:	For devnet-5?
00:20:22	Barnabas:	assuming we find nothing crazy on devnet 3 non finality

mainly lodestar/prysm nodes seem to be stuck
00:23:00	Fredrik:	Three weeks sounds late in case something goes bad with hoodi
00:23:21	Roman:	do we have a tentative target date when we’ll decide on testnet timestamps? or is it just after devnet 5?
00:25:06	kasey:	@stokes  could you please write out a concrete devnet and release timeline if you are proposing a change? We previously talked about mainnet release on 10/1, and presumably moving things back by a week would also move that date to 10/8.
00:25:36	kasey:	Yup for ACD would be great
00:26:26	stokes:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

I’ve always proposed mainnet for 5 Nov
00:26:41	stokes:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

Oh, you are talking about releases
00:27:02	kasey:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

Yeah so were you thinking mainnnet releases 3 weeks before 11/5?
00:27:09	stokes:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

Yeah, I think assuming everything goes well along the way there 10/1 would be good for mainnet (and hood) release
00:27:33	Roman:	can the same not be achieved with trusted peers only flag?
00:27:36	stokes:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

Yeah, we have this constraint that we want a month before the fork for mainnet releases
00:27:49	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

Responded on the telegram chat why that’s hard
00:27:56	stokes:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

So if we do 5 Nov for mainnet, we could do releases around 1-3 October
00:28:26	CPerezz:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

Yep. TLDR: Enodes change between CI runs. Thus need to be updated upfront every single time
00:29:01	kasey:	Replying to "@stokes  could you p..."

Understood, ty
00:29:14	Roman:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

let’s continue on tg
00:29:34	CPerezz:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

kk
00:31:21	CPerezz:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

Also @Roman . Would appreciate if you could reply a bit more exhaustively in: https://hackmd.io/WUe1KgwSS3iT8xoIbDg3Ng#Questions-for-Reth. Would be really useful and is the last client team missing. 

If nothing to add, just LMK.
00:32:42	Justin Traglia:	Opt-in or opt-out?
00:32:59	Roman:	Replying to "can the same not be ..."

ammending
00:33:11	Preston Van Loon:	prysm has support for opentelemetry today
00:33:33	James He:	I think we are using open telemetry already for tracing needs , would be cool to see an option in kurtosis for tracing etc without the external setup
00:33:39	Alexey:	specific examples of tracking using ot?
00:34:49	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "I think we are using..." with 👍🏽
00:35:02	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "I think we are using..."

Yeah it should be relatively straightforward for us to add support on kurtosis
00:36:40	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Besu supports OTEL today also
00:37:22	pk910:	dora should already be prepared :)
just need to update to latest gloas specs
