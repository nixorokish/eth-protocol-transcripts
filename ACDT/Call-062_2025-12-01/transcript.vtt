00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:30.940
Barnabas: I'm gonna wait a couple of minutes so that everyone can join.

2
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.319
Barnabas: Okay, I think we should be good to get started.

3
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.750
Barnabas: Rakush, can you please start the stream?

4
00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:27.570
Akash | ECH: Real life.

5
00:16:28.450 --> 00:16:29.240
Barnabas: Thank you.

6
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.839
Barnabas: Welcome, everybody, on Orcore Dev's testing call, number 62.

7
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:41.430
Barnabas: I'm just gonna post quickly the agenda for today. It's a pretty light agenda, so hopefully we can finish ahead of time.

8
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:50.249
Barnabas: First of all, happy birthday to the Beacon Chain. We just celebrated the fifth year anniversary of the launch of the Beacon Chain network.

9
00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:56.889
Barnabas: I think that's a pretty big achievement for everyone, that are on this call and not on this call.

10
00:16:57.270 --> 00:16:58.760
Barnabas: So, well done.

11
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:13.550
Barnabas: Regarding Cupaca, we did, main initiative work last week. Main Initiative work 1, was a success, we didn't find any, obvious bugs in there, so,

12
00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:20.540
Barnabas: I think we are very safe to, go into Minnet for Taco Fork on coming Wednesday.

13
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:25.109
Barnabas: Does anyone have any mentions regarding Fusaka?

14
00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.850
Barnabas: In case not,

15
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:39.599
Barnabas: I guess we will see how it will draw on Wednesday, but I think we should be all good to go.

16
00:17:40.010 --> 00:17:47.319
Barnabas: Okay, let's get into Amsterdam, then. Maybe, Stefan, you can take over regarding the Paul DevNet Zero update?

17
00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.500
Stefan: Yeah, sure. Can you hear me?

18
00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.550
Barnabas: Nope.

19
00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:01.519
Stefan: Perfect. We're making a lot of progress. I think we have a lot of clients that are now passing most of the execution spec tests.

20
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:15.729
Stefan: So that's really nice to see. Regarding the DevNets, we will probably be able to start one very soon. I'm still running some Kurtosis local testnets and running into some issues there.

21
00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:26.260
Stefan: I've already, created a DR to the execution specs with one issue I found in Nethermind with, gas, memory expansion.

22
00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:40.820
Stefan: how it's accounted, and otherwise, I'm… we're looking into a pre-compile issue also right now with NetherMind, but after that, I think we should be able to have 3 clients that are passing most. Maybe it would be good to get some client updates as well.

23
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:50.470
Barnabas: Yeah, that would be good. Is any EL teams ready to give us an update on their wall development?

24
00:18:54.380 --> 00:19:00.009
Marc: Yeah, for Nethermine, it's going well, passing 100% of the tests now.

25
00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:06.749
Marc: And just discussing with Stefan that issue you mentioned, which, doesn't seem to be covered by the test at the moment.

26
00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:13.850
Barnabas: Thank you. Anyone else?

27
00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.070
draganrakita: Don't miss out.

28
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:22.559
Dustin: actually passing… -Oh.

29
00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.770
draganrakita: Go, go for it.

30
00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:30.850
Dustin: Nimbus is passing all, but I think last I checked, 5 or 7? I forget which number of the tests.

31
00:19:31.450 --> 00:19:32.780
Dustin: So, yeah.

32
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:38.010
draganrakita: From Redside, we had… we…

33
00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:42.580
draganrakita: failing some withdrawals tests that I need to take a look.

34
00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:44.889
draganrakita: There should be it.

35
00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:55.890
Stefan: Is gas here?

36
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:03.759
Barnabas: I guess not. Nobody from Gus or Bezu?

37
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.790
Barnabas: Yeah.

38
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:07.539
Barnabas: Or is anyone from Desiway around?

39
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:19.230
Barnabas: In case not, does anyone have anything else regarding… Baldernut?

40
00:20:23.730 --> 00:20:24.960
Barnabas: Yep, Spencer?

41
00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.340
Barnabas: Hey.

42
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.780
spencer-tb: Yeah, I just wanted to say that it might be worth,

43
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:36.450
spencer-tb: Us on the testing side running all the static tests, so essentially the…

44
00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:40.579
spencer-tb: to tests from Ethereum tests, refilled for block access lists.

45
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:47.160
spencer-tb: I don't know, like, the fire has just been put out, essentially, for all the tests right now, and clients are passing, but…

46
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:56.250
spencer-tb: it might be worth… Also, getting all the clients to pass those tests for block access lists, too.

47
00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:03.380
spencer-tb: just thought I'd say that. But also, if it's a small dev net, it could also be worthwhile getting that up in the air.

48
00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.900
Stefan: Does this also include, like, sync testing, for example?

49
00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:22.190
spencer-tb: No, just, essentially, extra… extra tests, like, there might be some weird niche…

50
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.579
spencer-tb: niche case that, it could uncover.

51
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.040
Stefan: Okay, but I think that's it from my side for buck-level access to this.

52
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:48.280
Barnabas: Okay, thank you. Regarding APBS, is anyone around to give us an update?

53
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:55.769
Justin Traglia: From the spec side, we're still working on adding, test cases for get expected withdrawals.

54
00:21:56.310 --> 00:22:01.849
Justin Traglia: We have an update… sorry, we have a breakout call this Friday. I'll post the agenda right now.

55
00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:12.340
Justin Traglia: I might try to look into refactoring, get expected withdrawals to make it a bit cleaner this week.

56
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:17.469
Justin Traglia: And I guess, just whatever updates client teams have.

57
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.910
Justin Traglia: Regarding implementations.

58
00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:33.759
Barnabas: Regarding the trustless payments, I think, if anyone else has any concerns, then this would be a call to bring it up, right? Otherwise, we're gonna be proceeding with the trustless payments, for sure.

59
00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:40.560
Justin Traglia: Correct. But, keep in mind, the final decision on this won't be made this Friday. We're gonna save that for…

60
00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:44.809
Justin Traglia: the next ACDC call, so, like a week and a half from now.

61
00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:50.189
Barnabas: Oh, okay. I thought that it would be made… the call would be made on Friday already.

62
00:22:50.930 --> 00:23:02.379
Justin Traglia: I mean, I don't think it should. Not everyone joins the breakout call, and it's a pretty important decision to make, so… I'd feel more comfortable making it at ACDC.

63
00:23:04.470 --> 00:23:05.200
Barnabas: Okay.

64
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.140
Barnabas: Any client teams have an update, regarding implementation? Readiness?

65
00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:32.009
Barnabas: Okay, from Lone Star, they have the…

66
00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:38.089
Barnabas: Please progress on state transition. I'm passing the 1.6.1 specs. It's great.

67
00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.430
Barnabas: Anyone else?

68
00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.479
Barnabas: You guys don't need to be so shy.

69
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.090
Barnabas: Feel free to speak up.

70
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:07.040
Barnabas: In case no other updates, we can move on to the next topic, which is gonna be further gas increases.

71
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.570
Barnabas: So, Minnet just hit 60 million guests, last week.

72
00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.290
Barnabas: Which is very good news.

73
00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:19.100
Barnabas: And, I think the next step forward will be targeting 80 million guests.

74
00:24:19.530 --> 00:24:24.000
Barnabas: Do we have any updates regarding how we can achieve 80 million? And,

75
00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.119
Barnabas: What kind of repricing games we're gonna be playing for that?

76
00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.350
Barnabas: Yep, listen.

77
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:35.859
jochem-brouwer: Yeah, I wanted to mention that for the 80 million guests, we have the problem with the receipts.

78
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:39.249
jochem-brouwer: So this problem is that the def P2P network, it can

79
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.509
jochem-brouwer: It has this high limit of 10 megabytes of message limit.

80
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:51.220
jochem-brouwer: And we have a problem with the receipts, because at 83 million, we have this theoretical limit of actually going over this.

81
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:58.789
jochem-brouwer: Well, Camille was saying, hey, we switched to an issue for 85, but, well, I would say 80 is getting pretty close.

82
00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:05.940
jochem-brouwer: So, I would just mention the ERP which actually solves this thing. It's ERP7975.

83
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:16.999
jochem-brouwer: well, one of us, I would still say that 83 is also very close to it. I just want to mention that we are getting very close to this limit, and this ERP solves it.

84
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:30.159
jochem-brouwer: So, I think that we should start to implement this ERP, or something else which solves it. So, the EIP itself, it will just split up the def P2P messages into partial messages, and then we don't have this limit where we cannot send.

85
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:33.619
jochem-brouwer: The receipts which go to go over 10 megabytes.

86
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.540
jochem-brouwer: Yep.

87
00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:40.719
Barnabas: Right, so… but this doesn't require a hard fork, right? This can be just, rolled out.

88
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:41.660
jochem-brouwer: Yes.

89
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.080
Barnabas: You got pretty… okay.

90
00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:48.759
jochem-brouwer: It's a networking thing, but of course, all the clients could have to implement this. Yeah, but just wanted to mention this. Okay.

91
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:56.800
Barnabas: What would happen if, one client implemented it, and we would have, like, one message exceed the 10MB limit?

92
00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:00.739
Barnabas: Like, you wouldn't be able to peer with that one client, right?

93
00:26:01.890 --> 00:26:17.499
jochem-brouwer: I am not sure about this, but maybe if Felix from GEF is here, or someone from GEF can maybe explain this, but the EPA says that this is a sync issue, so this is likely not… well, that's not very nice, so maybe someone else can fill in on this.

94
00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:25.589
Łukasz Rozmej: So, the chain would progress, the problem would be that, the sync would not work for anyone.

95
00:26:25.790 --> 00:26:31.500
Łukasz Rozmej: Except this one client could sync from itself, because it's a different protocol version.

96
00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:42.259
Barnabas: Okay, but the question is, do we want to actually, roll this out with the next hard fork in Amsterdam, or do we want to see…

97
00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:52.740
Łukasz Rozmej: It can be hard for class, because it's a different protocol, DevP2P version, so we could do it without a hard fork, as soon as everyone is kind of ready.

98
00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:58.520
Barnabas: Okay, what do we want to target, for this release, then?

99
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.680
Barnabas: Is this something we can start discussing now?

100
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:16.699
Łukasz Rozmej: So, for example, Nevermind have this scheduled to be worked on, but we are not currently working on it. I expect we will be working on it in maybe 2 weeks or something.

101
00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:23.640
Barnabas: Okay, so maybe some… something like end of January, could actually work for this?

102
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:35.609
Ben Adams: I mean, it's… because of where it'll happen at syncing, it's not a disaster, because it means you're… you're starting up a new node, so the fix would be to upgrade your client.

103
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.270
Ben Adams: Yeah, so…

104
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:43.170
Łukasz Rozmej: So, as soon as everyone has a release with it, we can… it's not a blocker.

105
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:53.610
Barnabas: Okay, I will, start reaching out to different EAS and check on their implementation readiness, and then we can…

106
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:55.829
Barnabas: Tried to schedule it in.

107
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.950
Barnabas: Sometime.

108
00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:00.330
Barnabas: Probably end of June, or beginning of February.

109
00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.170
Barnabas: And, regarding any other blockers for 80 million,

110
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:14.879
Barnabas: Assuming that we could go on to 70… 870, then could we just go straight to 80 million?

111
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:27.080
Ben Adams: I'd just like to point out, though it's a bit redundant, since we're doing the fork on Wednesday, and we're unlikely to increase before then, that we'd have to wait till after Fusaka to…

112
00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.530
Ben Adams: To push it higher.

113
00:28:29.370 --> 00:28:32.500
Ben Adams: But, I mean, you know, that's only a couple days.

114
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:39.160
Barnabas: Push for what, exactly?

115
00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:51.239
Ben Adams: To go above 80 million, so we want, like, the receipts… we want… we want the changes in Fusaka to go higher than where we are now, so that would be, like, the tap on transaction limit, etc.

116
00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.310
Ben Adams: But As I say, that's only 2 days away, so…

117
00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.930
Barnabas: I just put a…

118
00:28:57.930 --> 00:28:58.959
Ben Adams: Put it on the record.

119
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:07.620
Barnabas: But we should just pipeline these things, and I don't think, like, Wednesday should be a blocker to, like, consider what else are we missing for the 18 million.

120
00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:12.930
Ben Adams: Yeah, I think it… I think it's just the receipts.

121
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.349
Ben Adams: After a second.

122
00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:23.659
Łukasz Rozmej: So, as far as I know, Carlos from EF is testing some… state scenarios?

123
00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:30.700
Łukasz Rozmej: State-related scenarios, and some of them were… not great.

124
00:29:30.930 --> 00:29:48.109
Łukasz Rozmej: Right now, but I think he didn't have the tests with applying the transaction cap from Fusaka, so… Yeah, so I think he wanted to redo it, so I don't know the state of it.

125
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.440
Łukasz Rozmej: Camille?

126
00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.100
Kamil Chodoła: Actually, actually do that. We need to rework all of our gas benchmarks to Fusaka right now.

127
00:29:57.250 --> 00:30:04.620
Kamil Chodoła: But this shouldn't be, like, super hard, so we'll do that this week, hopefully. And this and next week, to make it work.

128
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:23.530
Kamil Chodoła: And yeah, this is exactly the point that some stateful tests will be, quite challenging, but it's more likely on the edge right now. And there are some new scenarios which were never analyzed by a rigon, as I believe, and Bezu, where the performance is not the greatest.

129
00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:27.610
Kamil Chodoła: But we need to sit and check if those scenarios are actually valid.

130
00:30:28.210 --> 00:30:46.330
Kamil Chodoła: So, there are quite a few points. I will try to summarize that and send a note on what needs to be done to bump it further. But for sure, we need to wait for Fusaka first to even start considering that, and EF70, as mentioned. But if 70 is required for anything above 80.

131
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:54.359
Kamil Chodoła: So I would even say that maybe we could go safer with 75 or something, just to leave some buffer for this issue.

132
00:30:54.610 --> 00:31:00.010
Kamil Chodoła: and then go straight to 100 after the solving that. So on protocol level.

133
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.460
Kamil Chodoła: Actually, on networking level, there is only this receipt size issue.

134
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.190
Kamil Chodoła: But there are some things which probably can be optimized in clients to make it smoother.

135
00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:19.750
Kamil Chodoła: the biggest issue from Netarmine's side, I see, is that those stateful scenarios are requiring some bigger changes on DB level, which we have.

136
00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:23.620
Kamil Chodoła: But yeah, we are still analyzing them.

137
00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:36.160
Barnabas: Okay, thank you.

138
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:45.500
Barnabas: Yeah, the… I saw a bunch of suggestions, to just move to 75 instead of 80.

139
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.880
Barnabas: I'm not sure if, that's something we want to do, even, without the,

140
00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.449
Barnabas: Spilling up the receipts?

141
00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:04.700
Kamil Chodoła: Can you repeat, please?

142
00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.740
Barnabas: Is there a…

143
00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:13.649
Barnabas: Is there an appetite to actually just move to $75,000 instead of $80 million as the next step without the receipts?

144
00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:20.130
Barnabas: Or do we just want to, get unblocked on the receipts and just push to 80, or…

145
00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.440
Barnabas: Even further?

146
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:39.029
Kamil Chodoła: In my opinion, I would go 75 first, and just to leave a buffer between this issue, because maybe there is something which we didn't consider, so it will be slightly slower, but I guess this is the maxed out thing which we already have in our tests and in our knowledge.

147
00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:48.459
Kamil Chodoła: So 75 will leave us slight buffer, plus it will make us additional 15 MHz increase, and then 100 after… after solving that.

148
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:55.100
Barnabas: Does it pen?

149
00:32:55.430 --> 00:33:00.120
Ben Adams: I'd also add, since it takes quite a while to build momentum.

150
00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:05.440
Ben Adams: But also we can't really determine the timing, then…

151
00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.159
Ben Adams: We'd probably want to start the push before…

152
00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:15.310
Ben Adams: E70 was rolled out, but also…

153
00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:22.350
Ben Adams: Give us… give us that buffer in case it… it suddenly went up really fast.

154
00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:28.530
Ben Adams: You know, because we, as I say, we can't control the timing when the gas limit goes up, so I'd go more for 75.

155
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.260
Ben Adams: So we can start.

156
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:38.110
Ben Adams: Encouraging people to move up earlier, but also have the buffer in case it happens before we

157
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.480
Ben Adams: Have the protocol change widely rolled out.

158
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:54.160
Barnabas: I mean, 75 is something that could potentially be just bundled together with BPO3, because BPO3 would require a client release anyway.

159
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.270
Barnabas: Right?

160
00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:58.700
Ben Adams: Yeah.

161
00:33:59.250 --> 00:34:03.050
Barnabas: And we may… we may have ETH70 by then.

162
00:34:03.050 --> 00:34:04.820
Ben Adams: So, we could go.

163
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.829
Ben Adams: We could do the AT or whatever.

164
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:16.590
Barnabas: Yeah, I guess this is something we can start discussing now, and then hopefully roll it out around the end of January.

165
00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:28.809
Barnabas: Again, it will be up to the 870 implementation, and implementation readiness, whether we're gonna be targeting then 80 million or 75 million guests, whichever seems safe at that point.

166
00:34:33.159 --> 00:34:34.440
Barnabas: And Camille.

167
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:36.810
Barnabas: Hmm.

168
00:34:39.449 --> 00:34:44.710
Barnabas: Camille, would you like to discuss this, testing block V1?

169
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:49.489
Kamil Chodoła: This is something which Margin is working on. I can just give a short

170
00:34:49.489 --> 00:35:06.800
Kamil Chodoła: info on that. So, basically, we want to introduce a new namespace under our RTC, which will be fully utilized for testing capabilities. And here, this one specific example is to have a common interface between EL clients to trigger block building.

171
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:16.850
Kamil Chodoła: from RPC perspective, so we'll be able to basically performance test block building under certain…

172
00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:26.850
Kamil Chodoła: conditions, and also it will unlock us some better possibilities for… to generate lists. So, if you have any questions to that, feel free to ask me or Martin.

173
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:36.009
Kamil Chodoła: But yeah, this is something we are working on right now, and would be good to have some… someone from EL teams and from testing, DevOps team to take a look at.

174
00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:47.539
Marcin Sobczak: Yes, and I'm working on, like, proof-of-concept implementation in Nethermind right now, so, we'll have it soon.

175
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.269
Barnabas: Yeah, this looks great, from testing… side of you.

176
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:04.499
Barnabas: Is any other EL Iran that has read this, PR and could comment on it?

177
00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:26.169
Barnabas: In case not, please take a look and, give us the feedback in maybe a week from now.

178
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:37.569
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other discussion topics, regarding the higher gas limit?

179
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:57.679
Barnabas: In case not, maybe we can peer towards the next blob flag discussion. So, there's an EIP open for the next blobs, which some…

180
00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:10.599
Barnabas: Client teams liked, and some client teams didn't really like, because it's basically just a single flag that will limit local block builders to be able to limit how many, blobs they will include in a block.

181
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:18.239
Barnabas: Nethermind has a implementation of this, REF has an implementation in their, main branch, in their trunk branch.

182
00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:25.130
Barnabas: Is any other EL teams have an implementation, or opposed to having implementation for this?

183
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.760
Barnabas: Poem, this is not a…

184
00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:57.880
Barnabas: a CL question, this is an EL-related question, but I can post the EIP in a second.

185
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:07.380
Barnabas: It's EIP7872.

186
00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:43.900
Barnabas: Anyway, I think we should try to get this included into every single year before we hit the next BPO, because this could actually affect the local block builders if they have to build too many blobs with their limited bandwidth. They might result in pushing out an orphan block.

187
00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:51.039
Barnabas: So, this is, definitely a nice-to-have feature to… to include.

188
00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:56.170
Barnabas: I see that there's resource also tracking,

189
00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:09.350
Barnabas: That's good. And I haven't heard any, pushback from Geth either, so I think we should be good to go, and hopefully we can also start testing this feature, right after Fusaka.

190
00:39:12.050 --> 00:39:15.710
Barnabas: Okay, and then there's one more discussion topic that's,

191
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:21.820
Barnabas: a bit, deeper rabbit hole, so… Android API changes,

192
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:32.230
Barnabas: I proposed an engine API change in the execution… Execution chat in ET&D.

193
00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:46.289
Barnabas: I'm basically saying that we should switch to SSD for the engine API in order to decrease the times we spend on decoding the JSON payload.

194
00:39:47.560 --> 00:40:00.569
Barnabas: The topic brought up a bunch of, different, proposals, such as moving potential to, gRPC, or, moving to Protobus.

195
00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:10.480
Barnabas: But yeah, I would like to hear the opinions of different EL teams, especially, like, what they think about just

196
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.339
Barnabas: migrating everything into SSD as an optional, thing.

197
00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:22.040
Barnabas: Because, the more blobs we have, the more time it's gonna take to decode the, basics for encoded JSON.

198
00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:34.730
Barnabas: Not just in the discussion topic.

199
00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:40.499
Barnabas: I'm just curious if anyone has anything to say regarding this, on this call.

200
00:40:46.970 --> 00:40:48.380
Alexey: Do you hear me?

201
00:40:49.240 --> 00:40:49.900
Barnabas: Yep.

202
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:56.210
Alexey: So… Just, wanted to mention, then, if we…

203
00:40:56.510 --> 00:41:02.239
Alexey: introduce this encoding on your side. Right now, it will…

204
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:10.070
Alexey: will help us, to move quicker, to our end goal of having SSV.

205
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:14.230
Alexey: Everywhere, as a replacement for RLP.

206
00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:22.590
Alexey: And this format is not just a data format, it's a thing that we need to… optimize for.

207
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:28.979
Alexey: It means that, we can, store data, and.

208
00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:38.739
Alexey: Like, in database and, in memory, ready for, this, Encoding, and pass it quicker.

209
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:45.100
Alexey: We need to optimize serialization, make it parallel, maybe.

210
00:41:45.390 --> 00:41:57.330
Alexey: And all this work can start when we have at least something to work on. And if we could have a couple of endpoints supporting this format.

211
00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:06.049
Alexey: It would, I would say start work on, active work on SSD, on execution on their side.

212
00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.449
Barnabas: Sorry, do you mean, like, CL that would support this?

213
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:12.450
Alexey: Sorry?

214
00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.920
Barnabas: Did you mean that, you need an example from SCL?

215
00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.760
Barnabas: To support the SSD?

216
00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:26.460
Alexey: No, no, I mean, examples. I mean, like, applications of this format.

217
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:38.439
Alexey: Like, huh on Yale's side, to start experiment with optimizations and, proper, serialization, and maybe miracleization, even.

218
00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.790
Alexey: We just need to, like…

219
00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.159
Alexey: real application of SSD on your side, yeah.

220
00:42:47.350 --> 00:42:51.759
Barnabas: Wouldn't the engine API count as an application in your eyes?

221
00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.589
Alexey: Yep, yep, exactly.

222
00:42:53.980 --> 00:43:00.710
Barnabas: Yeah, so, yeah, I think this could be a very good first step into assessing everything, the whole stack.

223
00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:09.770
Barnabas: And it's not a huge change. Like, you wouldn't need to touch too many databases or anything.

224
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:16.849
Barnabas: In my eyes, this is basically as easy as it gets, to introduce SSD into the EL.

225
00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.509
Łukasz Rozmej: So I think this is a matter of prioritization.

226
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:49.500
Łukasz Rozmej: And… While it isn't consensus in any way, so we could also do it outside of the fork.

227
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:58.319
Łukasz Rozmej: this should be considered… if we want to do it, it should be considered when scoping Amsterdam, because it is actually…

228
00:43:58.450 --> 00:44:04.979
Łukasz Rozmej: especially for us, when we don't have a good SSD library out of the box,

229
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:10.699
Łukasz Rozmej: It's quite heavy on the effort.

230
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.700
Barnabas: Yeah, so, I don't know if this would require an EIP in your eyes.

231
00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:29.940
Łukasz Rozmej: It requires at least, execution spec, changes to execution spec, which are not 3D EIPs.

232
00:44:30.190 --> 00:44:38.559
Łukasz Rozmej: And, and, considering, like I said, considering in… at least for the scope planning of Glamsterdam.

233
00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.799
Łukasz Rozmej: So we just planned for it.

234
00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:50.409
Łukasz Rozmej: In terms of, like, the size of the scope.

235
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.550
Barnabas: So the journal blocker for future blob scaling could actually be limited by this, decoding.

236
00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:11.050
Barnabas: Based on the numbers that we've seen before, trouble said that, he spent about 300 milliseconds on 6 to 9 targeted max values, which is a significant amount of time.

237
00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:16.729
Barnabas: I know that, some, teams said that it was a lot quicker for them.

238
00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:25.400
Barnabas: And I'm still waiting for extra benchmarking, but, potentially we probably want to roll this out before Glamstadium again.

239
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:32.440
Barnabas: at least the latest by Grand Surgam, if we are actually aiming for, like, 72 blobs.

240
00:45:32.610 --> 00:45:37.370
Łukasz Rozmej: Do we have numbers for SSD versus JSON?

241
00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.050
Barnabas: In any client?

242
00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:47.429
Barnabas: Well, we don't have any SSD implementation in any of the years, so I would say no.

243
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:56.000
Alexey: Yeah, let's try to compare, considering we have GitBluff's implementation.

244
00:46:09.090 --> 00:46:15.760
Barnabas: Okay, so I guess we should actually do proper benchmarking with the different max values.

245
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Barnabas: And then, if it's something that we actually have to prioritize in Amsterdam or not.

246
00:46:22.690 --> 00:46:35.239
Łukasz Rozmej: Yeah, and it still should be, like, brought up in Glamsterdam planning, just because if we decide to do it, we might want to, you know, do less in Glamsterdam of other things, just to have a bit more headroom.

247
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:47.339
Łukasz Rozmej: And regardless if we even roll it out before Glamsterdam, right?

248
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.720
Barnabas: Yep.

249
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:53.669
Barnabas: Okay, I will, try to push for some benchmarks on this then.

250
00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:54.910
Barnabas: Mountain.

251
00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:56.090
Barnabas: Go forward.

252
00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:12.380
Barnabas: Okay, is there any other topics? I think we still have a bunch of time for open discussions, if anyone has anything else to raise.

253
00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:40.610
Barnabas: Yeah, Mario raised a good point that we can probably have benchmarks for all the different formats and figure out which one makes the most sense.

254
00:47:48.730 --> 00:47:50.589
Barnabas: It was the engine that blops.

255
00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:53.530
Barnabas: Fun.

256
00:47:56.570 --> 00:48:00.860
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: Yeah, I'm just wondering, what,

257
00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:12.339
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: what we should be aiming for, really, because I think get… what is in get blobs also applies to, get payload as well. I didn't write, get payload there. But,

258
00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:19.230
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: And that's gonna include the block as well as the blobs.

259
00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:22.909
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: Which will scale with the gas limit as well, so probably…

260
00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:26.780
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: engine get payload is the,

261
00:48:27.830 --> 00:48:29.769
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: the more important one, I think.

262
00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:47.739
Barnabas: Yeah, I think if we do end up going down the route of changing away from JSM to let it be SSD, or let it be literally anything else, we should actually consider, too, switching everything in the engine API, not just

263
00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.230
Barnabas: A specific function.

264
00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:51.960
Barnabas: Like, get maps, or get payload.

265
00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:56.050
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: Sure, I would agree with that if we go with SSE.

266
00:48:56.270 --> 00:49:02.229
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: But I'm wondering what, like, what is the impact on the CL? At what point does it become a problem?

267
00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:05.100
Simon (@siladu) | Besu: Because that'll determine the priority, I guess.

268
00:49:05.230 --> 00:49:10.780
Barnabas: Exactly, yeah. Yeah, we're gonna need to have better benchmarks for that, I guess.

269
00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:15.250
Barnabas: And have everything written down, black and white, and then we can figure out,

270
00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:17.470
Barnabas: How big of a problem this is.

271
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:40.660
Barnabas: Justin, I think we can,

272
00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:47.179
Barnabas: we can merge the ball and PPS breakout calls to ACDT from, like, next year onwards.

273
00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:50.420
Barnabas: At the 1st of January onwards.

274
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.349
Justin Traglia: Okay, that works for me. Sometime, beginning of next year.

275
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:56.230
Barnabas: Yeah.

276
00:49:57.550 --> 00:50:01.079
Barnabas: I'm not sure if anyone else has a comment on that, but…

277
00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:08.160
Barnabas: Yeah, next week, basically.

278
00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:26.429
Barnabas: But, like, it will be a bit too short notice, and I think we're gonna have a bunch of cancellations also in the end of the year, with Christmas and New Year's coming up, so I think it would be cleanest to just, have the current schedule going on for the rest of December, and then, yeah, decide which calls to cancel, and then…

279
00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:31.190
Barnabas: From next year onwards, we're just gonna start with, ACP.

280
00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.050
Barnabas: those topics.

281
00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.130
Barnabas: And I think the first ACDT will be on the 5th of January.

282
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.130
Barnabas: And regarding the lost ACDT,

283
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.599
Barnabas: Well, I'm not quite sure yet.

284
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.639
Barnabas: But we're gonna have it for the next few weeks, for sure.

285
00:50:59.620 --> 00:51:02.890
Barnabas: You can get back to that, recording from now.

286
00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:08.530
Barnabas: Okay, thanks for everyone's time. I think we can call it a day for now.

287
00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:12.420
Barnabas: And see you all on Wednesday at the Fork.

288
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.259
Barnabas: Good luck, everyone. Bye-bye.

289
00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:21.309
Justin Traglia: Hi, everyone.

290
00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:22.650
Łukasz Rozmej: Bye.

291
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:25.270
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.
