00:18:49	felipe:	I will take a look at your PRs today
00:20:22	felipe:	Besu is at 100% passing
00:22:00	Mario Vega:	I’ll coordinate with Felipe to get these filled, great suggestion spencer 👍🏼
00:22:01	Justin Traglia:	ePBS breakout call this Friday: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1801
00:22:13	Dustin:	sorry, have to go, other meeting, basically for ePBS steady progress, we're been merging into trunk

00:24:47	Kamil Chodoła:	receipts are issues for 85?
00:25:04	Barnabas:	Replying to "receipts are issues ..."

sounds like 80<83 😄
00:25:05	jochem-brouwer:	https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7975#rationale
00:25:25	Kamil Chodoła:	Go to 75 then :D and then eip implementation to unlock 100

00:27:28	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	So is that 25MGas/s or 18.75MGas/s target 😁?
00:27:45	jochem-brouwer:	This EIP is PFId for Glamsterdam BTW, but it is thus a network fork (update of devp2p/eth protocol). But we would need this at some point once we get closer to the limit (83 MiB)

To test the exec speed, if 80M is ok
00:31:13	draganrakita:	75 makes sense
00:32:23	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	Maybe should wait until BPO2 has stabilised on mainnet first?
00:32:43	Barnabas:	Replying to "Maybe should wait un..."

none of this would be rolled out before that 😄
00:32:55	Barnabas:	Replying to "Maybe should wait un..."

we just begin to discuss it
00:33:35	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	Replying to "Maybe should wait un..."

Does 75 require client changes?
00:33:41	Barnabas:	Replying to "Maybe should wait un..."

it doesn’t sound like it
00:34:09	Kamil Chodoła:	https://github.com/marcindsobczak/execution-apis/blob/main/src/testing/testing_buildBlockV1.md

Would be great for other client teams to take a look (very early version - still needs some small changes) - but will be a huge unlock of testability of block building and better tests generation.

is this an already open PR?
00:35:31	Barnabas:	Replying to "https://github.com/m..."

we could bundle this pr to one of the Bal devnets if people are happy about it

00:35:48	spencer-tb:	Strongly support this from testing (steel) side!

00:36:22	Kamil Chodoła:	We can follow back on that next week
00:37:03	Mario Vega:	Replying to "Strongly support thi..."

I think the only open qs for this was whether we want to create invalid blocks with this, but I think we really should not.
00:37:43	pawan:	Can you link the PR/issue for this?

does this calculation consider the gas limit on individual txs of 23mil?
00:38:34	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	Besu has an issue tracking it but not implementation yet https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/7683

not saying its gonna be easy, its gonna be as easy as it gets
00:44:35	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	Is there consensus on EL being SSZified in general?
00:44:50	Barnabas:	Replying to "Is there consensus o..."

its on a wishlist
00:45:10	draganrakita:	Replying to "Is there consensus o..."

In general, rlp does the job
00:45:43	Mario Vega:	There’s also some research that needs to be done in order to know which format is the most optimal for clients, I feel we should really think about this
00:45:52	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	I think 72 blobs should be significantly under 300ms with some optimisations, even with JSON

What research is this?
00:46:43	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "There’s also some..."

(is there someone looking into this specifically?)
00:47:19	Mario Vega:	Replying to "There’s also some re..."

Benchmarking with prototypes from each client, I feel like if we decide on a format, and then when it comes to impl, el clients might find that this is even slower or something
00:47:27	jochem-brouwer:	Heeft gereageerd op "Benchmarking with ..." met 👍
00:47:40	Simon (@siladu) | Besu:	What is the ceiling response time for engine_getBlobs or engine_getPayload?
00:48:21	draganrakita:	Reacted to "Benchmarking with pr..." with 👍
00:48:57	Kamil Chodoła:	So actually testing namespace solves the benchmarking testability of that? :)
00:49:07	Justin Traglia:	When should we transition BALs/ePBS breakout calls to ACDT? I forget when we did this for Pectra/Fusaka.
00:49:48	Chris Berry:	I seem to remember someone saying ACDT is for the next fork. So technically next week.
00:50:00	Chris Berry:	Or what Barnabas said
00:50:32	Justin Traglia:	Agreed 👍
