it needs to be an EIP, it needs to have a champion, and it needs someone that can’t burn out
00:56:10	Barnabas:	Replying to "we should talk about..."

its a thankless job, but can be done
00:56:39	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "we should talk about..."

you need to find someone who fits all that and also wouldn't rather work on something more interesting
00:56:51	Barnabas:	Replying to "we should talk about..."

The only way I can see us moving to an actual rpc standard if we block devnets on this EIP

00:57:19	keri:	Replying to "Can we make it an EI..."

I’d vote for simple changes first - consensus on RPC methods rather than a big change to rest
00:57:34	Łukasz Rozmej:	Replying to "Tests are generated ..."

So I assume not, so Geth is the spec ;)@Felix (Geth)
00:57:49	Barnabas:	Replying to "Can we make it an EI..."

sounds like 2 step pain vs 1 step pain
00:58:32	Sebastian Bürgel [Gnosis/HOPR]:	Replying to "we should talk about..." 

 It seems we're trying to fit a standards process into an existing EIP process. At least to some people who worked on standards, that doesn't seem to be the recommendable way to go:

 (I know this is painfully meta)
00:59:20	Łukasz Rozmej:	getLogs are problematic as they are very stateful
01:00:00	Sebastian Bürgel [Gnosis/HOPR]:	It's impossible to test these flaky logs for large ranges. We don't have a public test repo for that.
01:00:11	Felix (Geth):	it's not impossible!
01:00:24	Felix (Geth):	we are in control of the test chain, so we can just generate a longer test chain

we want to create a testing pipeline to sync multiple clients and do fuzz testing on eth_getLogs, but having hard time proritizing it, but should be done in not too much time
