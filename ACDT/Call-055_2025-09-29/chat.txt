check interop please
00:11:17	Jae Hee Lee:	Can we also get to test chaos testing Minhyuk implemented on devnet-3?
00:11:26	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Can we also get to t..."

Oh yes! That’s a good idea too
00:11:35	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Cc @Barnabas we should merge it in and try
00:11:58	Barnabas:	Replying to "Can we also get to t..."

Yeah we can do this in the second half of the week once we recovered the current non finality
00:11:58	Jae Hee Lee:	Reacted to "Oh yes! That’s a goo..." with 👍
00:12:00	Fredrik:	It’s being merged to the blog soon

Thanks!
00:12:16	James He:	We have released a version to support fusaka, there are ongoing issues, from a team perspective it should be fine for testate
00:12:20	James He:	testnet
00:12:29	James He:	But for some users there are issues
00:12:33	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Reacted to "check interop please" with 👍
00:13:40	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Our todo list for holesky in case we miss something:
client releases
shadowfork
roll our holesky nodes
validate holesky snapshots
spin up one of every client on our stack
tracoor for holesky, forky, dora
dugtrio should be updated and running
update checkpointz

00:30:44	Parithosh Jayanthi:	This 😄
00:34:39	Maria Silva:	Any idea if the bad performance on load for best is only for Xen? Or is it also for other smaller contracts?
00:34:45	Maria Silva:	*sload
00:35:13	Marius van der Wijden:	Sload performance should be pretty independent of contract
00:35:30	Ameziane Hamlat:	Reacted to "Sload performance sh..." with 💯
00:35:34	Marius van der Wijden:	Sstores are dependent on contract size
00:36:29	Maria Silva:	Right, so for Besu are there any changes in optimizations that may make this different from other clients?
00:36:30	Ameziane Hamlat:	Replying to "Sload performance sh..."

Agreed, it is more related to the pattern, accessing non existing slot keys.
00:36:37	Maria Silva:	Reacted to "Agreed, it is more r..." with 👍
00:36:41	Marius van der Wijden:	Reacted to Agreed, it is more r... with "👍"
00:39:27	jochem-brouwer:	For these optimizations or specific situations which are good/bad in clients I want to craft specific tests to signal areas where certain clients need (or need not) to spend some focus on 😃👍
00:39:29	CPerezz:	Any LSM-based client should have an issue with non-existing leaves right?
00:39:38	Justin Florentine (Besu):	i'd be surrised if that wasn't the case for everyone
00:39:43	Ben Adams:	Could change Sstore not to check current value for pricing 🤔
00:40:19	Maria Silva:	Reacted to "Could change Sstore ..." with 🤔
00:40:25	Marius van der Wijden:	Replying to "Could change Sstore ..." 

 I would kinda like that
00:40:44	Mario Vega:	Reacted to "Could change Sstore ..." with 🤔
00:40:46	Ben Adams:	Replying to "Could change Sstore ..."

Is the most expensive (short term) part of sstore
00:41:01	jochem-brouwer:	Heeft gereageerd op "Could change Sstor..." met 🚀
00:41:48	CPerezz:	FYI, all of the cases in https://hackmd.io/9icZeLN7R0Sk5mIjKlZAHQ  will eventually land in EEST. So make sure that whatever you propose isn’t already there.
00:42:01	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "Could change Sstore ..."

we'd be giving up a brake on state growth but...

I'd also like to explore this a bit

Idk what right answer would be; but maybe something to look into

Any idea of the speedup we would have if we took it out of the cost formula?
