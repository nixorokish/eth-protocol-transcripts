00:10:41	Manu:	For `prysm-{erigon,reth}-1`: Wiping DBs will very probably solve the issue, but waiting for inputs from EL before doing it, not to hide dust under the carpet
00:10:51	Alexey:	need a day to check nethermind nodes
00:13:15	pawan:	Thank you!
00:16:19	Marius van der Wijden:	no findings
00:16:31	pk910:	I'll ping offline devnet-3 nodes shortly, just noted the unfinality too :)

In regards to the split test:  Yea, we'll redo this,  but we need a stable chain first,  doesn't make muchz sense to split it again right now
