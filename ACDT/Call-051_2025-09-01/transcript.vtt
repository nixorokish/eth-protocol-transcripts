Pooja Ranjan: Hey, Mario.

2
00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.910
Mario Vega: Hello.

3
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.570
Mario Vega: How are you doing?

4
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.970
Pooja Ranjan: I'm doing good, thank you.

5
00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.229
Pooja Ranjan: So, what I'm gonna do is just share the details on the ACD chat.

6
00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.989
Pooja Ranjan: And a Zoom link as well, although the Zoom link is already provided on the calendar, but I hope this would be helpful.

7
00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:33.769
Mario Vega: Okay, do you mean chat here in the Zoom call, or… or chat? Oh, no, no, the ACD channel I have shared. Excellent, thank you so much.

8
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.760
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, I'm gonna start pre-streaming as well, let me know whenever you're ready.

9
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.240
Mario Vega: Hi everyone, let's just give a couple more minutes, until more people join, and we can get started.

10
00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:27.650
Mario Vega: I think we should be re- ready to start.

11
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.990
Pooja Ranjan: Real life.

12
00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:40.699
Mario Vega: Thank you so much. Good day, everyone. Welcome to ACDT number 51. Today is September the 1st.

13
00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:56.050
Mario Vega: Yeah, let's just get into it. The first item in the agenda is the Fusaka DevNet status update. I assume, since there's no launch yet, I would like to focus on DevNet 3.

14
00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.020
Mario Vega: A status, since that was the main issue last week.

15
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:07.260
Mario Vega: Do we have, anyone from the Eat BandOps team wants to chime in, regarding DevNet 3?

16
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:15.949
pk910: Yep, I can give a quick update. So, we had that unfinology test on Definite 3,

17
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.920
pk910: We fortunately recovered from that.

18
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:26.140
pk910: But right now, we seem to struggle with finality again. I'm not sure what's going on there.

19
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:36.840
pk910: Yeah, question is, is are there any outstanding, open points from client teams that are

20
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.919
pk910: Pending right now, or…

21
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.189
Manu: I can speak for PRISM. So Prism has…

22
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:57.689
Manu: three downs nodes, one with the reconstitia.

23
00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:08.390
Manu: For RES and Aragon, we have both issues with execution payload, which are invalid from Puiz's point of view.

24
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:16.270
Manu: Yes, basically, not matching routes and… And, unvalid block.

25
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.340
Manu: And so, we are, checking…

26
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:27.859
Manu: with Russ and everyone. And from Nimbusuel, I don't know, I didn't check. It's probably a memory, issue with Nimbusiel.

27
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.309
Manu: Yeah, that's it for Prism.

28
00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:40.699
pawan: I think for Lighthouse, I… I haven't checked the…

29
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:45.580
pawan: checked it since the weekend. I'll check it out today, but

30
00:08:45.840 --> 00:09:01.580
pawan: We have made progress on a new sync, sync algorithm, and I think we have ironed out almost all the edge cases. We have one or two, more edge cases that we need to fix, but we know what they are.

31
00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.319
pawan: So, we should have, like, a

32
00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:15.609
pawan: like, we should probably be merging the new sync strategy onto our Unstable soon, and

33
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:21.859
pawan: Yeah, I will look into the notes that are offline right now, I haven't looked into those yet.

34
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:42.290
Matthew Keil: For Lodestar, we've made a lot of updates and progress towards our syncing, and things are looking very good. All of our nodes are synced. We just have a ref node that, is optimistic, but, we'll look into that and try to get that sorted.

35
00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:59.649
Mario Vega: Any other clients that want to chime in? Is Teku on the call?

36
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.370
Mario Vega: Don't want to give you an update?

37
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.289
Mario Vega: Deku or Nimbus?

38
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:28.049
Mario Vega: Alright, okay, that's good to hear the syncing issues are dissipating.

39
00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:39.360
Mario Vega: Is there any other tests that we want to do, then, in DevNet 3, or is it gonna be deprecated? Also, is there any plan on the dates for DevNet 5 so far?

40
00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:58.959
Matthew Keil: I had a quick question on DevNet 3. It seems like, we were doing really well up until middle of last week, after we recovered from the forking and non-finality testing, and it seems like things are, just as a network, have kind of degraded. Was there something that triggered that? Like, did you guys run another test, or, like…

41
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.630
Matthew Keil: Something that… that caused it, so we could do some root cause analysis.

42
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:09.810
pk910: I think besides of the initial, Plant?

43
00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:14.279
pk910: back, there was no interruption since then. We've just tried syncing them.

44
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.599
pk910: And I'm also not sure what's happening right now, because he's lost finality again.

45
00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:19.800
pk910: Half an hour ago.

46
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:41.710
pawan: I have another request for DevNet 3. Like, once we've recovered from the current non-finality, like, before we shut down the DevNet, like, can we have, like, a planned

47
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:53.589
pawan: the similar, full chain split kind of thing that you guys did last week, so that… and, like,

48
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:59.720
pawan: Like, let us know beforehand when you're planning to do that, so that we can sort of monitor our nodes and

49
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:05.669
pawan: See in real time, like, how… They're doing, like.

50
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:10.340
pawan: Last time when you did that, like, we…

51
00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:18.800
pawan: Like, we went around to, like, check the notes while it was in the… Chain split stage, so…

52
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:27.700
pawan: If you could give us a heads up before you do that, next time, that'd be really helpful, because,

53
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:38.180
pawan: Yeah, we could check the logs and metrics during the chain split, and those would actually give us a few helpful

54
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:41.460
pawan: yeah.

55
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.369
pawan: It would be helpful for us to look at them while That is happening.

56
00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:53.710
pk910: That totally makes sense. We also plan to redo that, chain split test.

57
00:12:53.830 --> 00:12:56.710
pk910: Because, yeah, once everyone has fair…

58
00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:03.629
pk910: merged in, there are fixes, we want to retry it if it has any better… Positive effect or not.

59
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:07.759
pk910: So yeah, we'll give her a heads up before we start next time.

60
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:19.930
Mario Vega: Hey, PK, so one question on that is, that is… the plan is to reproduce it on DevNet 5, is that… is that correct, or are you guys planning on reproducing it again in DevNet 3?

61
00:13:20.630 --> 00:13:27.169
pk910: I think once definite 3 is fine again, we can also reproduce it on definite 3 again, just to see if it has… if the…

62
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:30.499
pk910: Improvements had any positive effect or not.

63
00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:34.559
pk910: Definite 5 will be a lot bigger, it…

64
00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:38.920
pk910: Probably makes sense to add that test there, too.

65
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:40.300
pk910: But, yeah.

66
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.640
pk910: To be decided, I guess.

67
00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:52.229
Mario Vega: Excellent. Thanks so much.

68
00:13:52.460 --> 00:14:05.400
Mario Vega: Alright, any other, comments on DevNetri? As far as I understand, the plan right now is to keep, monitoring DevonTree until things get better.

69
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.800
Mario Vega: And we regain finality again, and then we can decide on Definite 5.

70
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:17.620
Mario Vega: Or do you guys have plans for this week for Devon5, or is that pending? PK, do you know?

71
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:23.000
pk910: It will probably be next week, when everyone has their releases ready.

72
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.970
pk910: Or at least the fix is, matched in.

73
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.469
Mario Vega: Makes sense. Thank you.

74
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.560
Mario Vega: Alright,

75
00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:53.709
Mario Vega: Yeah, thank you. So, the next topic was syncing issues, but I think Lodestar, your guys already, chimed in on the topic, and also Lighthouse. Is there any other findings regarding syncing, that any other teams, stumbled upon, or…

76
00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:58.379
Mario Vega: Or got the opportunity to analyze on last week?

77
00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:17.589
Matthew Keil: We did have some findings, but I actually, I agree with Pawan that when we do the non-finality, or before we shut down DevNet3, it'll be great to…

78
00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:29.940
Matthew Keil: To do that chain fork type test again, so that we can monitor it as it's going, because it'd be really good to see how, things diverge, and how our algorithm is actually picking it back up.

79
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.780
Mario Vega: Got it. Yeah, of course. Excellent, thanks.

80
00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.249
Mario Vega: Any other comments regarding debit tree syncing?

81
00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.489
Mario Vega: From clients… from the execution clients, was there any findings during the non-finality test that anybody wants to share?

82
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.490
Mario Vega: Alright, no comment, so I guess everything went fine there.

83
00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:33.689
Mario Vega: Alright. Yeah, if there's no further comments on DevNet 5, I'm sorry, DevNet 3, we can jump into the next topic, and just to reiterate, DevNet 5 would be probably launching next week, so we should be good there, and we are gonna discuss that in the next week's call.

84
00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.730
Mario Vega: Alright.

85
00:16:35.970 --> 00:16:41.869
Mario Vega: Great, the next, oh yeah, and one comment from PK is that…

86
00:16:44.630 --> 00:16:51.939
Mario Vega: he's gonna monitor the three notes, if I understand correctly, in regards of the non-finality that is currently happening.

87
00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:57.050
Mario Vega: And yeah, we're gonna redo the split chain again on Definitely.

88
00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.019
Mario Vega: With a prior notice.

89
00:17:00.430 --> 00:17:01.790
Mario Vega: Good.

90
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:07.310
Mario Vega: Alright, next topic is gas limit, testing updates, I think…

91
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.800
Mario Vega: Camille is the main person here,

92
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:14.019
Mario Vega: Do you want to keep an update on this?

93
00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.110
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, can you hear me?

94
00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:18.310
Mario Vega: Perfect, yep.

95
00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:29.290
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, good. So, last week, we worked quite a lot on the… on making sure that we are able to test stateful scenarios on top of any existing

96
00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.729
Kamil Chodoła: Database, an existing chain.

97
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.560
Kamil Chodoła: So, yeah, we have some successes here, so…

98
00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:51.909
Kamil Chodoła: basically, I'm able to use EEST Execute and start any EL client on top of any network, but in some isolated way, that I can run execute, consume all of the transactions which are being produced by EST,

99
00:17:51.920 --> 00:18:06.439
Kamil Chodoła: and wrap them as a new blocks, and basically record all of the usage, and record all of the new payloads. So, this opens a door for all of these stateful scenarios which we want to execute, want to try out, like Zen.

100
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:17.309
Kamil Chodoła: et cetera, and see how… how it performs, and we'll be able to execute that on top of BlotNet, as well, to see how integrates on higher… on bigger states.

101
00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:24.509
Kamil Chodoła: So, yes, right now, working with Johim on that. Johim is writing a new scenario in EST, which will be mainnet-specific.

102
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:28.269
Kamil Chodoła: And, I will be working on the generation of tests.

103
00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:35.600
Kamil Chodoła: Also, like, the EST integration is there, I just need to polish a few things and make a documentation, and I will merge it from this week.

104
00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:41.100
Kamil Chodoła: So, by default, gas benchmarks will be utilizing the ESD scenarios.

105
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:51.279
Kamil Chodoła: And yes, we'll not focus a lot on compute scenarios anymore, rather we'll start switching to the stateful scenarios, just to see how it works on top of manual.

106
00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:58.869
Kamil Chodoła: And of course, I will execute all of the compute scenarios on maintenance data as well, just to see if this is getting…

107
00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.620
Kamil Chodoła: Much affected, but not expecting, like, a huge difference.

108
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:19.070
Kamil Chodoła: So yeah, on that, and today I got some questions from Bezo team about how to run the EST test, because they had some issues with that. Hopefully, this is moving forward right now, so Bezo can check the… visiting team can check the current bottlenecks on their side.

109
00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:28.650
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, I can talk about that issue. Thanks, Camille. So,

110
00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.740
Ameziane Hamlat: Yeah, I could actually, once, specify in the good Genesis file to run all the tests.

111
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:44.949
Ameziane Hamlat: It took some time, but now I got all the results and could reproduce the issues. But yeah, we have been, we have someone working on…

112
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:50.640
Ameziane Hamlat: Improving, different arithmetic opcodes.

113
00:19:50.890 --> 00:20:00.730
Ameziane Hamlat: Like, mod, mill mod, but, we, we just need to take some time to, to test them, because it's like,

114
00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:04.059
Ameziane Hamlat: A new implementation, so we just need…

115
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:06.939
Ameziane Hamlat: To have good, good tests,

116
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:10.720
Ameziane Hamlat: And, and then we can go Fraud.

117
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:27.440
Mario Vega: Yeah, I think someone from your team reached out to see which tests they should be running. I think a combination of Ethereum tests and the latest release from EEST would be the sanest and safest way to go.

118
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.320
Mario Vega: We are also preparing a new release from EEST.

119
00:20:31.530 --> 00:20:43.879
Mario Vega: It's probably gonna come out this week, and it should contain basically everything that you need to get full coverage if you want to fully test your new implementation. But yeah, we'll reach out to you guys when that happens.

120
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.260
Ameziane Hamlat: Okay, thanks.

121
00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:52.360
Mario Vega: Cool.

122
00:20:52.730 --> 00:21:00.479
Mario Vega: Anything else here on the topic that gas… of gas limit? Do we want to go into the discussion about 60 million at the moment?

123
00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:20.769
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, so, as we discussed probably last week and last weeks in general, $60 million can be considered only if you'll have fixes from Bezu, some decisions and fixes from GAF about, modest improvements before Fusaka.

124
00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:31.540
Kamil Chodoła: And before Fusaka will need to analyze then, and once we'll have some outputs from stateful testing, then we can make some further decision about 60.

125
00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:42.670
Kamil Chodoła: So, like, 3 points. Once we'll solve all of this, we can… Start considering rolling out 60.

126
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.410
Mario Vega: Excellent.

127
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:49.539
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah, cool.

128
00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:58.450
Mario Vega: On the Modex issue from Geth, is there anything that you guys need from… Anyone?

129
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.019
Mario Vega: To proceed on this, or is… are we good, or…

130
00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.669
Marius van der Wijden: There's nothing needed, we…

131
00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.539
Marius van der Wijden: slowly working our way through it. We have,

132
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:20.649
Marius van der Wijden: PR that improves the gas computation, which should give us between, like, 2 and 10% improvement.

133
00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:25.480
Marius van der Wijden: And then the… the bigger thing is to… to actually have…

134
00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.060
Marius van der Wijden: Actually upstream our stuff to the…

135
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:34.350
Marius van der Wijden: to the Go Standard library. This is just a longer process.

136
00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:40.539
Marius van der Wijden: This is a priority for me, so I will,

137
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:43.919
Marius van der Wijden: I will, update next week.

138
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:51.580
Marius van der Wijden: About concrete, the when and how we can move… forward with this.

139
00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.370
Mario Vega: Sounds good.

140
00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.730
Mario Vega: Thank you. Alright, yeah, that seems about it.

141
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:02.810
Mario Vega: Cool.

142
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:16.940
Mario Vega: So, should we move to the next topic? The next one is, Glamsterlam testing updates, specifically EPBS and local access lists. I see Tony on the call,

143
00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:21.289
Mario Vega: Or anyone else who wants to give an update on Black Global Access List?

144
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:33.909
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, no real updates from my side. Maybe if Felipe is on the call, he might have more insights into how we are doing on the testing side. Or Rahul.

145
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:40.569
felipe: Yeah, I can give a quick update,

146
00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:45.870
felipe: The spec side is cleaned up and passing CI.

147
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:49.690
felipe: And the testing side is also talking to it.

148
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.310
felipe: I think, because we're merging, Both of those codebases.

149
00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:59.080
felipe: It's kind of waiting for a little bit.

150
00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.250
felipe: But it is, it's pretty good to go right now.

151
00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.550
Mario Vega: Awesome, thank you. Great.

152
00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:22.280
Mario Vega: And on EPBS, is there anything that we have to discuss today?

153
00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:25.099
Mario Vega: Dan, anybody wants to bring up?

154
00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.830
Zoom user: Can you guys hear me?

155
00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:38.660
Mario Vega: Yes, perfectly. Yep.

156
00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:55.959
Zoom user: Yeah, so, this is Terry, sorry, my display name is messed up. I guess one thing to give an update on is that, like, we have been working on spec tests on the… on the consensus spec report, so that's on the, the new upgrade name, Glorus, I don't know how to pronounce it.

157
00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:02.819
Zoom user: But we have sped tests for SSD test vectors and stuff, and then all the block operations are there, and the EPOB processing.

158
00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:13.349
Zoom user: So, as you implement the new spec, you could also, like, add a spec test. There are a few bugs here and there, which I won't be specific on the bugs, but yeah, if you have any questions, just ping me. Thank you.

159
00:25:18.690 --> 00:25:19.509
Mario Vega: Thank you.

160
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.800
Mario Vega: Alright, and…

161
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:31.789
Mario Vega: Talking about consensus specs, I forgot to mention there is a new release. I remember there was a consensus issue.

162
00:25:32.190 --> 00:25:42.669
Mario Vega: talked about this last week on this call, so I assume that the new test vector is included in this new release. I'm gonna link it right now.

163
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:57.169
Mario Vega: Yeah, I don't have more info on this, but please check out the release notes, and just make sure that everything's there, unless there's anyone here to chime in on details of that.

164
00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:59.860
Mario Vega: But I don't see anyone, to be honest.

165
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:06.880
Mario Vega: Anyway, just wanted to mention it. There's a new release, please check it out, for Consumer Specs.

166
00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:10.800
Mario Vega: Cool.

167
00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:21.919
Mario Vega: Alright, and the last topic I have here is Sunnyside Labs. Is there anything that anyone from Sunnyside wants to chime in?

168
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:25.170
Mario Vega: If not, that's okay. Yeah. Okay.

169
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.230
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah, hi, nothing really particular.

170
00:26:28.550 --> 00:26:37.409
J Sunnyside Labs: This week, we will be starting to prepare for the DevNet 5, if we were going to launch it early next week.

171
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.840
J Sunnyside Labs: And continue testing, in between.

172
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:51.790
Mario Vega: Okay, sounds good.

173
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.970
Mario Vega: Cool.

174
00:26:55.450 --> 00:27:02.500
Mario Vega: That was everything in the agenda today. Is there any topic that needs to be raised anybody wants to talk about?

175
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:22.630
Mario Vega: Otherwise, I think the priority right now is trying to fix the finality situation in .NET3, and the bug further syncing.

176
00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:32.669
Mario Vega: If possible, we're gonna retry to do the finalization test once we have FinalLG again, and then we can talk next week about DevNet 5.

177
00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.070
Mario Vega: If that's okay.

178
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:44.449
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah, I think that's everything for this week, quick call. Thanks, everyone.

179
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.629
Mario Vega: for joining. Okay.

180
00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.070
Marius van der Wijden: Thanks, buddy.

181
00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.120
Tim Beiko: Thank you!

182
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:51.730
Mario Vega: But…

183
00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:53.660
Toni Wahrstätter: Thank you.
