00:07:34	Trent:	Happy merge day ❤️
00:08:51	J Sunnyside Labs:	This might be useful
00:10:06	Justin Traglia:	I just started looking it btw.
00:11:16	Justin Traglia:	I think it’s not handling point-at-infinity commitments properly. Something in ckzg changed here in the most recent release. Should be easy to check.
00:12:52	Dustin:	jtraglia: the issue here is Nimbus can't run alpha.6 reference tests at all (or at least all of them) without 2.1.2
00:13:05	Dustin:	so we can't practically revert
00:13:43	Justin Traglia:	Just a theory
00:13:47	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	We reverted ckzg lib and redisabled latest kzg ref tests
00:14:07	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "We reverted ckzg lib..."

Oh, because of this issue?
00:14:12	Dustin:	Enrico: in response to this, or just in general?

That’s general I think. If you use ckzg lib
