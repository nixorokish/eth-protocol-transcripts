1
00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.790
danceratopz: Good morning, everyone.

2
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.410
Akash | ECH: Hayden…

3
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.360
Justin Traglia: Good morning.

4
00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.180
Akash | ECH: Dan, I'm helping with the stream today, so let me know whenever you are ready.

5
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.880
danceratopz: Perfect. Okay, thanks, Hakash. So, basically, I'll say, let's go, and then…

6
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.139
danceratopz: I wait for you to give me the okay that the stream's live, and then we go, right?

7
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.350
danceratopz: Perfect.

8
00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750
danceratopz: Hey, Ahash, the,

9
00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.290
danceratopz: The AI will take the notes automatically, I see it's flashing at the top. Perfect. Good morning, everyone, by the way.

10
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.240
jochem-brouwer: Good morning.

11
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.189
jochem-brouwer: Or actually, good afternoon.

12
00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:37.140
danceratopz: Okay, I think we've got… quite a good…

13
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:40.080
danceratopz: Turn out so far, so,

14
00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:42.269
danceratopz: Akash, if you could start the stream.

15
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.599
danceratopz: That'd be amazing.

16
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.930
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are, like…

17
00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:57.589
danceratopz: Perfect, thanks. Hello, today's the 15th of September 2025, and welcome to ACDT number 53.

18
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:02.590
danceratopz: Mario is out of office today, so he's asked me to step up.

19
00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:12.479
danceratopz: And, facilitate the call. I just dropped the agenda in the chat. And first off is, happy Mergeiversary. 3 years today.

20
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:21.459
danceratopz: We have the merge, so, everyone was watching the Panda ASCII out in their terminals happily.

21
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:28.419
danceratopz: Crazy to think it's 3 years ago, and 3 upgrades ago as well. So…

22
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.079
danceratopz: 2 for Saka. First rule, we're gonna have some Fusaka DevNet updates.

23
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:39.190
danceratopz: And then we're going to talk about the new simulator that's landed on the HiveView page.

24
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:43.990
danceratopz: And, have a look at the EL consensus tests and what the state is there.

25
00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.430
danceratopz: So first off, Fisaka DevNet updates. Barnabas, do you want to take the lead?

26
00:07:51.930 --> 00:08:00.080
Barnabas: Yeah, sure. So, physical.NET 5 has started last week, Wednesday, and we've been going through a fork a day.

27
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:16.590
Barnabas: We did, for example, 256 epox later. There was no significant problem there, and then the first BPO, increased the blood, maximum blood, count from 9 to 12. Then…

28
00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:18.800
Barnabas: The 12th?

29
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.349
Barnabas: Just one sec.

30
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:34.040
Barnabas: No, to 15, and then we went to 21, and now we are at, 13th Street, and tomorrow we're gonna go to 48, and then, on Wednesday to 72.

31
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:47.130
Barnabas: We currently see quite some orphaned blocks. This can possibly be caused by a few different things, that are being currently discussed in the interrupt channel.

32
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.990
danceratopz: I could go into.

33
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.570
Barnabas: off…

34
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:53.659
danceratopz: Is there anything else you want to add for DevNet5?

35
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.900
danceratopz: Omnibus.

36
00:08:56.350 --> 00:09:06.859
Barnabas: Yeah, so one of the main issues that we had is the MEV machine, had the wrong rate limiting, so none of the MEV blocks,

37
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:23.629
Barnabas: got included in time, and that was a misconfiguration from our side. So hopefully, we just fixed this issue, like, maybe half an hour ago, so hopefully we're gonna be able to see less orphan blocks, built by the, Navy builder.

38
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:38.540
Barnabas: Another thing, Nimbus, reported some issues, possibly with the DKSCG library. Maybe, someone from, the Nimbus team can give us an update regarding that.

39
00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:46.279
Dustin: Sure, yeah. So, we're, we're not… I want to say totally…

40
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:54.489
Dustin: sure that… that… where the, issue… issue lies here. But, this… oh, let me say the symptom is that

41
00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:58.289
Dustin: If you look at the… the data column,

42
00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:15.069
Dustin: the verify cells, proofs, function, something named like this, is… is in, inconsistently, apparently, returning, sort of a… a success or not success.

43
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:27.109
Dustin: response, in different clients, and Nimbus is, at least at times, not, validating a lot of these columns, but we'll…

44
00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:29.159
Dustin: See, that… that's… that's…

45
00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:47.750
Dustin: what exactly is happening there, and part of the issue is that there's, as is already being discussed in some things, different people are running, and different clients are running different versions of the CKCG library, and there have been changes about how strict that is over time, so that's one possibility. There are others. Anyway, yeah.

46
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.710
danceratopz: Okay, thanks, Dustin.

47
00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:03.450
danceratopz: But is this the… I kind of don't quite have a context on this. Is this the issue that you've seen with Nevermind, that Nevermind are working on, or is this a different issue?

48
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:16.670
Dustin: No. No, those are… those… Sorry, yeah, that's a completely separate issue. That's their V-Org issue. So they say. I'll take their word for that, and… and in any case, no, it's a different issue.

49
00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.669
danceratopz: Okay, thanks for clarifying.

50
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:24.349
Barnabas: I think for the Nethermind bug, maybe someone from Nethermind can give us an update.

51
00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:29.400
Alexey: Yeah, so… Oh.

52
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:38.109
Alexey: Recently, we started getting errors related to, reorgs.

53
00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:47.240
Alexey: It happened on Lighthouse and Dimbus nodes, so most likely the issue is on our side.

54
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.359
Alexey: Well, it's… when the…

55
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:57.340
Alexey: Consensus, client, sent us new payloads.

56
00:11:57.850 --> 00:12:01.490
Alexey: But, on the same level, or the same block number.

57
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:12.979
Alexey: But, from different forks, sometimes, we, use, incorrect parent from different fork, for, the block,

58
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.170
Alexey: We are retrieving, for synchronization.

59
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.999
Alexey: And, it's fixable. We are testing the fix.

60
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:28.989
Alexey: And, it happens, due to reorgs, and probably,

61
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:34.270
Alexey: Like, mixed with, restarts, or something like that.

62
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.440
Alexey: Which leads, to having, Run parent for a block.

63
00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:51.089
Alexey: will… we did not, see it happening a lot before. Maybe we just broke master.

64
00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:56.169
Alexey: In some, By some other contribution.

65
00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:02.269
Alexey: Not sure, but, Fixu seems to,

66
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:08.879
Alexey: be helpful, and I hope we will soon have it in master.

67
00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:22.190
danceratopz: Okay, perfect. Thanks for the update, Alexi. I see there's some chat about,

68
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.209
danceratopz: the original bug that Dustin mentioned,

69
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:31.859
danceratopz: I think Justin mentioned that, it's not handling, point infinity commitments properly.

70
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.880
danceratopz: And… so, basically, Justin's already on it, as I understand.

71
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.980
danceratopz: And Dustin mentions that the problem is that Nimbus can't run the other six reference tests.

72
00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.300
danceratopz: Okay, just a theory, says Justin.

73
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:56.290
Barnabas: There's one more thing. So, Teku had a bug just merged in yesterday, and they were also updating to 2.1.2.

74
00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:04.230
Barnabas: I'm… that Bob was caught by our, think trainer. I'm not sure if that's related or not.

75
00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:13.039
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, we were seeing the same problem, so… we actually, reverted

76
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:22.670
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the CQCG, that was our… our Java wrapper that was pointing to the very latest CKZG.

77
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:25.779
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Lib, and we reverted that.

78
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:38.779
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And because the latest version was actually able… enabling us to pass all the tests for the Alpha 6, we then reverted the…

79
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:45.960
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The enablement of those tests back to disable, so we can actually be,

80
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:52.900
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): on the network, but not passing reference tests yet. That's the current… Situation.

81
00:14:54.510 --> 00:15:00.120
Justin Traglia: Okay, I'll fix this in CKZG and publish a new release as soon as possible.

82
00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.020
danceratopz: Awesome, thank you. Good news.

83
00:15:11.530 --> 00:15:22.159
danceratopz: Okay, the other things I just wanted to mention about DevNet 5 is, we… well, it was launched, obviously, last Wednesday. We've had 3 BPOs so far, and the next BPO is scheduled.

84
00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:25.630
danceratopz: For tomorrow morning at 6.32 UTC.

85
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:32.350
danceratopz: And I just wanted to add that we have some tooling now on the steel side.

86
00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.720
danceratopz: And, Felix, managed to, confirm

87
00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:47.440
danceratopz: that the clients were correctly configured via, Dano's Eveconfig, endpoint that he championed.

88
00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:57.609
danceratopz: Using the new execute EAFConfig command. And, if you want to find out a little bit more, I just dropped a link in the chat to, a blog post on eveconfig that Felix added this morning.

89
00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.220
danceratopz: To the documentation log.

90
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:02.500
danceratopz: Execute.

91
00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:13.300
danceratopz: and thanks, Jay, for sharing the BPO schedule in the chat. That also states when the… Next VPO

92
00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.960
danceratopz: Upgrade will go live.

93
00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:20.510
danceratopz: Okay,

94
00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:32.289
danceratopz: just in case you missed it, Watchtower's not ran for DevNet 5, so if you need your image to be updated for your client, please do reach out… reach out to someone, it won't be updated manually.

95
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.380
danceratopz: And, I saw some other chatter.

96
00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.920
danceratopz: About some mystery node on the network called,

97
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:46.760
danceratopz: TYSM, and this is a diagnostic node from PRISM, so it's a modified… sorry, it's a diagnostic node from each PanDrops.

98
00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:55.610
danceratopz: This is a modified PRISM node with some additional monitoring that, if Pandrop's added, so if you see those on the network, you know what you're looking at.

99
00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:59.190
danceratopz: Is there anything else for DevNet 5?

100
00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:00.699
danceratopz: Before we move on.

101
00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:21.790
danceratopz: Okay, so, vanvas, did you want to mention anything about DevNet 3? Seems like it finalized, but…

102
00:17:22.079 --> 00:17:26.089
danceratopz: It's now not finalizing again, as of about 4 hours, as far as I could see.

103
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.000
danceratopz: Is, worth going into that now, or…

104
00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:36.030
Barnabas: Oh, I didn't know. We can take a look.

105
00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.840
Barnabas: I guess, we're doing another non-finity test.

106
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:47.699
Barnabas: This… yeah, we… we don't plan to do this, so I will have to take a look at what's happening.

107
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:55.570
danceratopz: Okay, yeah, no problem. Devnet 3, Pavan. I was just mentioning DevNet 3. DevNet 5 is fine.

108
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.179
danceratopz: Okay, Paris says DevNet 3 was unplanned.

109
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.480
danceratopz: Okay, so we don't need to worry about definite 3.

110
00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.350
danceratopz: I thought we were…

111
00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:11.060
Barnabas: No, it was unplanned.

112
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:13.279
Barnabas: Not planned.

113
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:16.300
danceratopz: Okay.

114
00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.990
Barnabas: We should worry about that industry, of course.

115
00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:20.200
danceratopz: Yes.

116
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:25.410
Matthew Keil: Yes, please, because we are actively using that as a testbed, and I think some of the other teams are as well.

117
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:44.750
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, it wouldn't be… we were, I think, at 70-ish percent, so it could just be that there was, some client push, and Watchtower just deployed an update that led to a restart loop. We can have a look and make sure that that isn't the case.

118
00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:58.140
danceratopz: Yeah, so it was at, 78% as of 4 hours ago, and then it dropped off to about… just under, so, like, 63… 62, 63%.

119
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.090
danceratopz: But yeah, it's quite new, just 4 hours ago.

120
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:14.519
danceratopz: But I guess the main focus at the moment is DevNet 5 for everyone.

121
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.649
danceratopz: The last definite topic I'd have for Fusaka would be if there's any updates on Shadow Fork testing, or whether…

122
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.790
danceratopz: That's not in pro… process… progress? Not on the go at the moment, no.

123
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:41.690
danceratopz: Okay, if there's no shadow fork testing update, then…

124
00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:49.499
danceratopz: I'd go to the next agenda item, which is the fact that we've got a new simulator on Highview since last Wednesday.

125
00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.120
danceratopz: Called ConsumeSync.

126
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:57.359
danceratopz: I think Felipe would like to… Briefly introduce what it does.

127
00:19:58.490 --> 00:19:59.360
felipe: Sure, yeah.

128
00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:02.840
felipe: Yeah, I can give a brief update.

129
00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:08.490
felipe: So, I posted something in the chat that… that if you're familiar with Consume already.

130
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:17.170
felipe: This basically builds on top of it, and what we wanted was a way to, verify client sync after certain tests.

131
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:20.149
felipe: And right now, it only exists for,

132
00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.899
felipe: the block RLP limit, for Osaka.

133
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:35.309
felipe: And, so basically, we parametrize whatever clients are set up in the HiVML file, twice.

134
00:20:35.470 --> 00:20:44.270
felipe: And so… For each client under test, you'll end up syncing to every other client, including itself.

135
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.820
felipe: After these payloads are sent, via…

136
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:56.499
felipe: the engine API. And so, just like in Zoom Sync, we send payloads over the engine API, we start up the sync client.

137
00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:04.229
felipe: And we use the Hive boot node and, admin at peer to… Establish syncing.

138
00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:06.879
felipe: And we make sure…

139
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:11.929
felipe: Syncing is kept alive, and we just verify at the end of each of these tests.

140
00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:20.850
felipe: And so this is kind of a nice way for us to sanity check, syncing and, the state route after… after some… some test payloads.

141
00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.450
danceratopz: Awesome.

142
00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:29.339
danceratopz: Thanks a lot for the update.

143
00:21:30.290 --> 00:21:36.779
danceratopz: So this was mainly introduced to test the, RLP block limit, right? Or the block RLP limit.

144
00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:43.969
felipe: Yeah, for now. So this is a… this is a new marker on the… on the east side, and so we can add this…

145
00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:55.509
felipe: Either locally, if we're testing Hive for sanity checks, or we can also just… this will run on the Hive dashboard as well for the few tests that we turn it on for.

146
00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.930
danceratopz: Awesome, thank you.

147
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.949
danceratopz: So, the last Fusaka point is a quick…

148
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:10.769
danceratopz: overview of the execution layer consensus tests. I think Spencer would like to…

149
00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.849
danceratopz: Give a quick overview here, what's the state?

150
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:21.410
spencer-tb: Yeah, sounds good. I'm gonna share my screen just briefly, if I can.

151
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.240
spencer-tb: You guys see… see what's going on?

152
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.439
danceratopz: Yep, we can see it, thank you.

153
00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:37.410
spencer-tb: So, yeah, I basically just wanted to say that,

154
00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:45.519
spencer-tb: we're now running the Ethereum test, general state test, so these are all the older tests

155
00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:51.069
spencer-tb: Not the tests that we wrote, but we have refilled them all for a sec- for a second now.

156
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:59.200
spencer-tb: And I mentioned in the last call that we added them to the latest release, but we're now running them in Hive, and it looks like all the clients are doing a really good job.

157
00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:06.320
spencer-tb: All these fails are kind of non-critical fails, and can be tweaked, quite easily.

158
00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:10.119
spencer-tb: On the east side, on our side, and also on,

159
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:17.810
spencer-tb: Yale side, so yeah, to be honest, I just wanted to say that, it feels… Feels good,

160
00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:26.740
spencer-tb: And yeah, also thanks, like, to all the EL clients for being really responsive, over the past, couple weeks.

161
00:23:27.910 --> 00:23:29.210
spencer-tb: Yeah, and…

162
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:38.610
spencer-tb: On our side as well, we'd like to finalize our EIP checklist for DEL tests. We're nearly there.

163
00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:42.230
spencer-tb: Personally, I'd like to add some more BPO tests.

164
00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:50.800
spencer-tb: And maybe a few more EIP7918 tests, yeah, on the spec test side, on the EL side.

165
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:55.799
spencer-tb: Just wanted to give that brief update. And, yeah, ConsumeSync here is added to these…

166
00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:00.620
spencer-tb: are failing right now, I think mostly for… from timeouts. It's a new simulator, so…

167
00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.840
spencer-tb: Hopefully a quick fix, but yeah, that's it.

168
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:10.489
danceratopz: Great, thanks a lot for the update.

169
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:24.209
danceratopz: So the, the Ethereum general state tests that are now included in the release, these tests have been moved from Ethereum tests to execution spec tests.

170
00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.749
danceratopz: And they're being filled by the new framework, no longer by retestees, so…

171
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:31.830
danceratopz: These tests have sort of been migrated to the

172
00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:37.780
danceratopz: to the new system. So there's some unification there, but the… they haven't been ported.

173
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:47.650
danceratopz: the JSON and the YAML, test format has stayed the same, but we read them and we fill them using the execution spec test framework.

174
00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:54.459
danceratopz: Okay, so I think that's it for Fusaka, unless anyone else has something to add.

175
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:10.100
danceratopz: Okay, moving on to scale DI1, gas limit testing. I can just very briefly mention on our side,

176
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:25.790
danceratopz: As in from steel and execution spec tests. We have some ongoing work on a new test wrapper format, which basically will just improve test developer experience, because we'll, like, abstract out the EIP7825 transaction gas limit.

177
00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:33.049
danceratopz: So you don't need to worry about that when you're… when you're trying to fill up your… your block. The framework will handle that for you.

178
00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.679
danceratopz: I think this work is quite close to completion.

179
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:45.970
danceratopz: And… Secondly, some work is ongoing, regarding, sort of validating or verifying a bloatnet testing approach using

180
00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.460
danceratopz: The east execute command.

181
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:54.250
danceratopz: Apart from that, Camille is out of office at the moment.

182
00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:01.380
danceratopz: If anyone else from Nevermind would like to give an update, please… Do step in.

183
00:26:02.740 --> 00:26:09.640
danceratopz: failing that, Jochen… I think would like to briefly mention the…

184
00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:16.779
danceratopz: benchmark tests that he's been writing based on the ZEN contract, and using mainnet state.

185
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:23.790
jochem-brouwer: Yes, yeah, I want to quickly say that we are currently setting up a test network.

186
00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:33.139
jochem-brouwer: to, well, we have seen that, mainly we have seen some slow blocks, and these are all related to Xen, so Xen is, like, a super big state contract.

187
00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:39.410
jochem-brouwer: And what we are trying to do is we are researching what happens if we raise the limit to 60 million.

188
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:47.520
jochem-brouwer: And then try to get, like, okay, what's the worst case behavior if we now do the same scenario, but now not for the 45 million guest limit?

189
00:26:47.650 --> 00:26:49.570
jochem-brouwer: For the 60 million estimate.

190
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:56.880
jochem-brouwer: And that's still… well, it's… the tests are being written, and the network is, well, we are setting this up.

191
00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.710
jochem-brouwer: And we hope to produce, results On this, like, this week.

192
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:22.289
danceratopz: Thank you. So, I think, Joachim's mainly interested in creating tests that touch a lot of state to stress test that scenario. So, if anyone has any ideas on other scenarios to add for that, then please

193
00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:25.769
danceratopz: Feel free to add them, reach out to Jocham.

194
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:33.649
danceratopz: I think that would be it for the gas limit testing update. Moving on to Glamsterdam.

195
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:42.260
danceratopz: block-level access lists. So, they had breakout number 2 last Wednesday, which is live on YouTube.

196
00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.749
danceratopz: The agenda is linked in the notes.

197
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:53.469
danceratopz: I'll just add quickly that, there was a new, test vector release last week.

198
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:58.400
danceratopz: With… which fixed some, issues found in both the specs and the tests.

199
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:03.589
danceratopz: So I'm not sure if Tony's here and would like to give a brief update on the…

200
00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:06.190
danceratopz: State block lists outfit, access level lists.

201
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:10.200
danceratopz: I'm not sure if he's in the call.

202
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.830
Toni Wahrstätter: Yes, I'm on the call.

203
00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:12.940
danceratopz: Perfect.

204
00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:19.410
Toni Wahrstätter: Yeah, there are not many updates. This week, next breaker call will happen Wednesday next week.

205
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:28.730
Toni Wahrstätter: We're currently still planning to do the definite end of month, and we are right now waiting for the first CL implementation, such that we

206
00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.310
Toni Wahrstätter: Can test it locally.

207
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:33.250
Toni Wahrstätter: And I think Terrence already said that you will do that.

208
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:39.609
danceratopz: Excellent. Sounds good.

209
00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:46.469
danceratopz: From EPBS, I don't have much to say. I think, as far as I could tell, the last breakout was on the 29th of August.

210
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:52.230
danceratopz: Not sure if POTUS is in the… in the room, wants to share something, or someone else, about EPBS.

211
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.200
danceratopz: Okay.

212
00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.870
danceratopz: It would seem that there's no EPVS updates this week.

213
00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:09.840
danceratopz: The only other thing that I would… Mentioned briefly is that…

214
00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:15.209
danceratopz: Reth had a mainnet stall, was it last week, or the week before? I've lost track.

215
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:20.930
danceratopz: But there's an excellent post-mortem for it, and…

216
00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.570
danceratopz: I can chat in the chat really quick.

217
00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:31.120
danceratopz: I'm sure everyone's seen it already. And, of course,

218
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:38.029
danceratopz: We, on the execution spec test side, we would like to be able to catch this kind of failure, obviously, and we don't at the moment.

219
00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:43.049
danceratopz: I would just add that Mario's already added a test for this specific case.

220
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:59.010
danceratopz: But triggering it via a reorg scenario in the engine simulator is still a work in progress. So we don't really run through reorg scenarios so far, we're just validating payloads. So this needs a little bit of work, but we also hope

221
00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:03.760
danceratopz: That, that this can be covered via the spec tests.

222
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.869
danceratopz: I saw that, Ref already,

223
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:14.130
danceratopz: Added end-to-end testing to prevent this in the future on their side. But of course, it'd be nice to have it.

224
00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:17.820
danceratopz: Somewhere where all clients can profit from.

225
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:28.810
danceratopz: Did anyone want to… did anyone from the ref side, or did anyone else want to mention something about that?

226
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.470
danceratopz: Otherwise,

227
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:46.059
danceratopz: Yeah, yeah, it's very detailed. Thank you, Roman. It should be… should be in the post-mortem. Yeah, thank you.

228
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.530
danceratopz: Yeah, it's an excellent document. Okay, if…

229
00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:58.289
danceratopz: If anyone else has any other topics, then please shout up, or if I've forgotten something, please let me know.

230
00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.570
danceratopz: I think we've gone through the agenda.

231
00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:03.390
danceratopz: PK.

232
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:13.009
pk910: Yeah, I got one thing to talk about. It's, Fusaka-related again. Eth calls,

233
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:23.890
pk910: We have the new, gas limit for, per transaction in a block, but, we agreed to not apply that limit on ETH calls, as that's a read-only

234
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.459
pk910: method, that's used by UIs a lot.

235
00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:35.590
pk910: And the situation right now is that get, arrogant, and Red, ensure or enforce a limit there.

236
00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:43.020
pk910: Which is, yeah, with just a new, gas limit at 16 million.

237
00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.699
pk910: Even worse is that they're,

238
00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:59.769
pk910: even if no limit is set in the RPC call, they are somehow taking a limit of 50 million, and then failing further down the line, because it's higher than the new EIP

239
00:32:00.210 --> 00:32:11.330
pk910: Yeah, gas limit. And that's a regression from what we had before FULU, and should really be fixed before any release, because it's heavily, heavily used by UIs.

240
00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:20.470
pk910: And yeah, it affects, Geth, Aragon, and Rath right now. I've posted a message in, execution Devs.

241
00:32:26.910 --> 00:32:31.600
danceratopz: Amazing, PK, thank you very much. I just dropped a link to the Discord chat.

242
00:32:32.630 --> 00:32:34.359
danceratopz: Okay, she wanted to go there directly?

243
00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.450
danceratopz: Anything else anyone has to mention?

244
00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.900
danceratopz: Okay, perfect. Then, thanks everyone for coming.

245
00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.099
danceratopz: And, have a good week.

246
00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.540
danceratopz: Happy hacking.

247
00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:57.630
jochem-brouwer: Thank you.

248
00:32:58.150 --> 00:33:00.030
Toni Wahrstätter: Bye-bye. Thank you. Bye-bye.

249
00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:01.760
felipe: Thanks, Steph, bye.

250
00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:02.680
Louis: Thank you.
