1
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.440
Mario Vega: Oh!

2
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.410
Pooja Ranjan: Hey, Mario! How are you?

3
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.120
Mario Vega: I'm doing fine, thanks, all good, and you.

4
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.313
Pooja Ranjan: Doing well, I wasn't sure that we are. Gonna have the meeting today given. Monday is like holiday for most of the Us. People. But when I noticed agenda and everything.

5
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.609
Pooja Ranjan: I don't.

6
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.260
Mario Vega: Oh, really.

7
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.550
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

8
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.327
Mario Vega: What's the holiday.

9
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.429
Pooja Ranjan: Called Memorial Day.

10
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:38.243
Mario Vega: I thought of that already had happened earlier this year. I'm I'm i i don't follow us holidays that that closely.

11
00:01:38.963 --> 00:01:52.939
Pooja Ranjan: No, that's all right. Yeah. I wasn't sure. But when I noticed it then I started working on creating stream, because it seems like Bot failed, so we will again have to figure out why it failed. But at least we have the stream link ready.

12
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.590
Mario Vega: Boom.

13
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.390
Mario Vega: hey! Louise!

14
00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.960
Louis: Hello.

15
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.920
Louis: I can run a test now.

16
00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:02.510
Louis: But but the test fail or bugging, yeah, for yeah, for Rip.

17
00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.600
Mario Vega: Cool.

18
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.200
Mario Vega: That's very cool.

19
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:14.999
Louis: I'm checking. How could I check the console so I could trickle, arrow and debug.

20
00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.510
Mario Vega: Nice. I'll get back to your message later.

21
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:21.859
Mario Vega: After the meeting.

22
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.920
Mario Vega: Probably.

23
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.140
Louis: Yes, that's fine.

24
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:05.639
Mario Vega: Hi! Everyone who's joining we're gonna give a couple of more minutes before we start the stream, and then we can

25
00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.160
Mario Vega: begin.

26
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.070
Mario Vega: Think we should be good to go. Should we start the stream now.

27
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:40.240
Pooja Ranjan: We are, live.

28
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.000
Mario Vega: Perfect.

29
00:07:43.258 --> 00:07:50.799
Mario Vega: Hello, everyone. Welcome to Acd number 38. Today's May 26, th

30
00:07:51.010 --> 00:08:00.300
Mario Vega: and we have just 3 items in the agenda, and the main one is regarding the Fussaka Devnet.

31
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.560
Mario Vega: Basically.

32
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.810
Mario Vega: I think we should start with that one just to see how clients are

33
00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:11.809
Mario Vega: looking up to join the Devnet.

34
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:30.039
Mario Vega: and we can continue with Peer Das. And then history expiry if there's anything to talk about. Also, there's another topic by that was raised by Anders. I think this was left incomplete on Acde, and we can just

35
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:33.349
Mario Vega: finish it here if if he joins the call

36
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:39.490
Mario Vega: alright. So yeah. Starting with the Poseca devnet 0.

37
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:57.049
Mario Vega: I think we can. Start with testnets, test status, and then we can follow up with them status, and so on and so forth. Pari, do you mind going first, st or should I? I just have a a quick basically update about the tests. But do you want to.

38
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:04.120
Mario Vega: Alright, yeah. Basically, the 1st update is that we have a release from East Side.

39
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:10.539
Mario Vega: about the second 0. It it contains the sfide

40
00:09:11.566 --> 00:09:35.219
Mario Vega: eips, basically is MoD. X, only the the 2 mode xp related eips they are inside in the release, and it's ready for for everyone to just run it. And we can. We also have a hive hive instance already running at the current moment. We only have go ethereum

41
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:51.600
Mario Vega: live in here, so please check it, and if you want, and you have a release, or you have a branch that you want to use to run your client in this. Please reach out to Baritosh and and they they can, or or someone. In the event Ops team. And they can. They can add you to this.

42
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.000
Mario Vega: To this hive. Instance.

43
00:09:55.840 --> 00:10:24.269
Mario Vega: we have another another simulator for hive that is getting ready. It's not quite ready yet, is regarding the blob transactions and the engine Api endpoints that we want to test inside of East. The reason it's not ready yet is because we have to make a lot of modifications to East for it to be be able to send the transaction through clients and also

44
00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:35.950
Mario Vega: request engine Api requests that the gap blobs. Basically. So that's the reason why it's not ready, but we're working on it, and we should be ready in the following days.

45
00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:41.280
Mario Vega: That's that's it from my side. Paritosh! Do you have any anything else.

46
00:10:41.788 --> 00:10:59.110
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah. So we still have to update the hive instance with the client images that we're using in Fussaka devnet 0. I can do that after the call is done. But yeah, Barnabas is already on the call, and I think he has updates on Fusaka Devnet 0, so I'd let him go first.st

47
00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:17.480
Barnabas: Yes, we just had. About an hour ago. We decided to schedule a day from now, and the 1st a day after that we are gonna have enough time for every client team to take a closer look if everything's working, it also allows the

48
00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:31.590
Barnabas: new client seems to still produce a full already image before we head tomorrow. Currently, we still waiting for nimbus and lighthouse on the sales side and Icon on the air side to have a

49
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:35.070
Barnabas: a new image that should be fun already.

50
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:44.010
Barnabas: and I think regarding Peter's under 7. We plan to shut it off tomorrow.

51
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:47.640
Barnabas: after the Flow fork is done.

52
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.880
Mario Vega: Okay, thank you.

53
00:11:58.905 --> 00:12:00.194
Mario Vega: I think.

54
00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:09.230
Mario Vega: we can switch it up now to hear from clients if there's any concerns about joining the Devnets. How's everyone looking?

55
00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:16.189
Mario Vega: Particularly Aragon? I think it's the one that you mentioned that is missing.

56
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.510
Mario Vega: Is there? Is there any updates in from their side.

57
00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:25.520
Barnabas: They have a working branch or

58
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:29.390
Barnabas: a work in Progress branch. I haven't had a chance to test it yet.

59
00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:38.970
Mario Vega: Marius, can you hear us?

60
00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.570
Mario Vega: I think the issues on his side? Yeah.

61
00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:54.549
Mario Vega: alright so. And from Nimbus on the Cl side.

62
00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:58.300
Mario Vega: do you have any updates?

63
00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:09.500
Barnabas: I'm not sure if you're asking me or someone from the numbers team. But basically, they also have a

64
00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:16.749
Barnabas: an image that is currently under testing and from lighthouse I haven't heard anything yet.

65
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:21.350
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I think the last estimate was lighthouse will give us an image tomorrow.

66
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.610
Mario Vega: Okay, sounds good.

67
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:49.099
Mario Vega: Alright. Is there anything else that we have to discuss regarding definite 0? Is everyone aware of the changes that should go in or have any questions or discussions to be made about definite 0.

68
00:13:54.573 --> 00:14:08.740
pawan: Just to be clear about the Bpo the Bpo changes. It's just the eip as is without any of the changes that have been proposed with respect to the 4 version changes right.

69
00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:19.059
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, exactly. So. The focal version changes, and any anything else is still in flux. And we would do that for devnet one or potentially devnet 2.

70
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.550
Mario Vega: Sounds good.

71
00:14:35.382 --> 00:14:40.869
Mario Vega: Alright, if there's nothing else for definite 0, should we discuss definite one?

72
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:49.310
Mario Vega: I think there! There were 2 sfi sfi eips in the last acde

73
00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:57.713
Mario Vega: Is there anything that we want to discuss that that now? Or should we defer to to next week when we have

74
00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:00.780
Mario Vega: deployed 11 0.

75
00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.390
ethDreamer (Mark): There was one other thing related to the last question on the Devnet 0 Fork, but.

76
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.520
Mario Vega: Yes.

77
00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.269
ethDreamer (Mark): Or have been discussing, is a config change

78
00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:27.189
ethDreamer (Mark): where we don't necessarily include the like Electra and Fuloo epochs in the blob schedule

79
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:37.069
ethDreamer (Mark): like we had initially decided to do that. But we've had discussions that maybe that's not a good idea, just because it could lead to

80
00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:38.500
ethDreamer (Mark): changes.

81
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:47.570
ethDreamer (Mark): so, or it could lead to like inconsistencies in the config. But is the devnet 0 version expected to have those in the config.

82
00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.500
Barnabas: I'm sorry. Could you repeat that.

83
00:15:54.168 --> 00:15:57.599
ethDreamer (Mark): So the config may or may not have

84
00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:08.529
ethDreamer (Mark): the in in the blob schedule. It may or may not have the Electra and foulu blob parameters. That's 1 1 of the things we've been discussing. So

85
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.720
ethDreamer (Mark): not only do we need to know

86
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.060
ethDreamer (Mark): what the spec is for, Blob.

87
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:20.489
ethDreamer (Mark): for Bpo forks on Devnet 0. But we need to know what the config is going to look like for Devnet 0, because that may change in future forks.

88
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:28.269
Barnabas: Yeah, I mean, here's I just posted the current version for W. 0. We already had Genesis. So

89
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.820
Barnabas: this is what we have in the Prof. Schedule.

90
00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:38.020
Barnabas: and we still we we do not have.

91
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.430
Barnabas: Who knew next props, but we still have an extra.

92
00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:53.349
Barnabas: because we haven't merged that prn yet we're discussing about having the extra look schedule

93
00:16:54.150 --> 00:16:56.126
Barnabas: in the next potential

94
00:16:57.145 --> 00:17:01.869
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, it actually looks like the Electra and Deneb

95
00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:08.640
ethDreamer (Mark): parameters are not there in this, which I think is what we're planning to do in the future. Anyway.

96
00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:15.099
Barnabas: Yeah. Yeah, it's still under discussion. That's why we didn't bother to

97
00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:17.809
Barnabas: do add them here for now.

98
00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:20.349
ethDreamer (Mark): Okay, that's fine.

99
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:33.640
Barnabas: Also, if we ever gonna include those officially, then it's gonna be really painful to test anything, because then we would need to

100
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.449
Barnabas: always go through those in a way.

101
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:37.350
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah.

102
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.859
Barnabas: Couldn't just start from Genesis.

103
00:17:38.860 --> 00:17:42.199
ethDreamer (Mark): Right. That was one of the concerns was that

104
00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:46.340
ethDreamer (Mark): we'd really have to make sure that especially across different test nets and stuff

105
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.700
ethDreamer (Mark): like it's a it's a duplication of the existing

106
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:58.299
ethDreamer (Mark): of of it's putting the same thing in the config twice and have to really make sure those match. And it's not probably a lot cleaner not to do that.

107
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:14.029
Barnabas: Yeah. So in future future they're not. I would assume that we just gonna agree on okay, which Bpo, we start the genesis rate, we're gonna have 0 set to whatever 18 and then go from there.

108
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.890
Mario Vega: Any other comments regarding the config.

109
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:48.639
Mario Vega: The Bpo config. Sorry the rest of the of the teams clear on how to how to proceed

110
00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:04.690
Mario Vega: alright. And yeah. Pari shared the link to the second one.

111
00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:17.249
Mario Vega: aspects. I think I think someone mentioned in the chat that 79, 18 is also included, and, as as far as I know, I think we we specify that

112
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.150
Mario Vega: last week, and then there was only a couple of

113
00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.690
Mario Vega: changes to be to be made to the eap.

114
00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.940
Mario Vega: But yeah, I think I think it is sufficed.

115
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:41.359
Parithosh Jayanthi: Is. Does that mean we want to definitely have this in Fusaka Devnet one? Or do we want to delay that for Fusaka Devnet 2,

116
00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:49.079
Parithosh Jayanthi: and the main reason for delaying would be in case we want to

117
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:57.769
Parithosh Jayanthi: have the devnet up as soon as possible, because we would like to have a devnet one ready by the interrupt event in Berlin.

118
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:02.630
Ansgar Dietrichs: As good. Yeah.

119
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:23.980
Ansgar Dietrichs: I think the main reason to select it for Devnet. One was just that it looked like there was only, I think, a single new addition to Devnet, one on the dev call, and we had a few ones already pending for the addition to Devnet 2. So it was really just a pragmatic choice, nothing principled behind it. So if it actually makes more sense to push it to Devnet 2, I don't think that would be an issue.

120
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:38.709
Mario Vega: And I think the other argument was that there was a constant that was missing. I mean it was the only thing that was left to define.

121
00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.908
Mario Vega: and since the consulting is not made mostly

122
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:50.679
Mario Vega: risky part of the eip, I think we could include the definite one, and if the constant changes. We can change the constant in

123
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:53.079
Mario Vega: the minute you. I think that was

124
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:56.850
Mario Vega: the decision. If I remember correctly.

125
00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:00.229
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that's my understanding as well. There was

126
00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:07.740
Ansgar Dietrichs: one last change that needed to be done to the Ap. Anders is on the call, maybe, Andas, you could briefly summarize whether you made that change already, or whether that's still pending.

127
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:24.101
Anders Elowsson: Yeah. So I updated the IP yesterday. So now there is a constant we we are still going to probably discuss the exact setting for this constant, but we have a a specification now, and I posted it in the

128
00:21:25.108 --> 00:21:32.010
Anders Elowsson: Pm. For the for this call also, and you can just see the aip. There's a specification. Now we can use.

129
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:37.590
Mario Vega: Thanks, Anders, is the eap already updated?

130
00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:39.870
Mario Vega: Or does it need an update.

131
00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.580
Anders Elowsson: It's already updated.

132
00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:54.249
Mario Vega: Sounds good. I I think we have everything to proceed with. Tsd, also testing for Tcip.

133
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:59.240
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, I've added it to the eip list for definite one.

134
00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.140
Mario Vega: Excellent.

135
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:03.560
Mario Vega: Yeah, thanks.

136
00:22:07.610 --> 00:22:13.410
Mario Vega: All right. Anything left to discuss comments or status from

137
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:16.989
Mario Vega: any clients for demo 0 or demo. One.

138
00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:32.450
Parithosh Jayanthi: I think Dimitri asked about a consensus back. Pr, that is still open, just linking it in.

139
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:38.370
Parithosh Jayanthi: I don't have the current status. Do we have someone looking at this.

140
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.929
Mario Vega: Yeah. Do you mean? 43, 23.

141
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:44.600
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah.

142
00:22:44.986 --> 00:22:45.760
Mario Vega: Yes, okay.

143
00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:49.940
Mario Vega: Is anybody aware of the status of this? Pr.

144
00:22:53.800 --> 00:23:03.109
Parithosh Jayanthi: I'm not sure if G. 11 tech is on this call, but maybe if Justin or I see Pawan's posted about it.

145
00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:18.259
pawan: Yeah post on the Pr, like, at least for lighthouse. I don't think it. That would be useful in any way, because we do not request multiple roads in a single

146
00:23:18.946 --> 00:23:21.679
pawan: like columns by route request.

147
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.079
pawan: So yeah, that's what I posted on the pr.

148
00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:37.210
pawan: but yeah, I'm not. I'm not also sure like how exactly it will give us any benefits in terms of like better bandwidth, consumption, or anything like that.

149
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:40.280
pawan: Not convinced that it's helpful.

150
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.270
Mario Vega: Yes, gajinder.

151
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:48.280
Gajinder: Yep, thanks.

152
00:23:48.955 --> 00:23:58.210
Gajinder: So basically, the aim of the Pr was to make the request size smaller. And it would benefit definitely in the sense that. Okay.

153
00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:09.960
Gajinder: if you have a list of block twos, basically you know it. I don't think that would save time in the amount of creating the request. But definitely, if you have, you're requesting a lot of peers.

154
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.660
Gajinder: then you can send the request faster and they can inspect it earlier and say that okay, these are the

155
00:24:16.181 --> 00:24:31.438
Gajinder: columns that they might not have, and they might also reject the request earlier. So in that sense, the latency of such request would come down. But given the discussion that has happened, many clients sort of pool

156
00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:46.009
Gajinder: different blocks that they get the blocks that they get from gossip, and definitely, their columns might be different. So in that sense, I don't think that this format is going to serve that mechanism where

157
00:24:46.674 --> 00:24:54.550
Gajinder: you request the where you are basically requesting the columns for those that you have not received in gossip.

158
00:24:54.660 --> 00:25:01.430
Gajinder: although in Lorsa we had a different mechanism going on where? For the

159
00:25:01.570 --> 00:25:06.090
Gajinder: blocks for which D is not complete, we basically request them one by one. So

160
00:25:06.674 --> 00:25:15.115
Gajinder: so that was my context for making this particular Pr. But if other client, other clients are basically requesting

161
00:25:16.163 --> 00:25:23.370
Gajinder: the the known da blocks altogether which they were, which were to be da'd in gossip.

162
00:25:24.162 --> 00:25:29.699
Gajinder: Then basically, this request doesn't serve that purpose. So in that sense, I guess we can leave this Pr.

163
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.809
Mario Vega: Any comments from other teams. About this pr.

164
00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.890
Manu: Yeah for prism. We, we do not yet request multiple

165
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:58.779
Manu: data columns by roots for different data column indices. But we plan to do it.

166
00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:10.009
Manu: And so yes, in this sense this pull request won't help us, and we should. We would like not to see this pull request merged.

167
00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:16.769
Manu: So the current status is is okay for us, for prism.

168
00:26:23.150 --> 00:26:23.929
Mario Vega: Thank you.

169
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:33.850
Mario Vega: And Gagina mentions that he's fine closing the pr given the future usage plans.

170
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:45.116
Mario Vega: Do you want to wait for other client teams. We? I think we have. We have comments for only 2. Do you want to wait for,

171
00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:48.729
Mario Vega: Maybe other clients to chime in before closing.

172
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.080
Mario Vega: Okay, cool.

173
00:26:54.050 --> 00:26:54.905
Mario Vega: Great.

174
00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:07.799
Mario Vega: alright. Yeah. If there are no more comments regarding Devon. 0. We can jump into peer desk. Right. Now

175
00:27:08.250 --> 00:27:12.829
Mario Vega: let me see who is in the call.

176
00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:28.240
Mario Vega: Does anybody have any of these prepared us in this call?

177
00:27:33.403 --> 00:27:37.270
Manu: I can talk about prism. So right now.

178
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:47.170
Manu: Still, a lot of code in prism for pure desk, or is, is in our dedicated Peerdas Branch.

179
00:27:47.981 --> 00:27:54.240
Manu: and we are slowly merging it into our unstable branch, namely, develop.

180
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:59.839
Manu: There is still a lot of work to do, but it's progressing quite well.

181
00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.180
Mario Vega: Yes, pawan, and then Sunnyside labs they want to share doesn't results.

182
00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:18.352
pawan: Yeah, for lighthouse we've been, I think, other than like, we haven't completed

183
00:28:19.890 --> 00:28:33.480
pawan: adding Bpo to our definitely branch. And we are still working on validator custody but that shouldn't be required as such for definite for net, for the definite 0

184
00:28:34.213 --> 00:28:53.669
pawan: other than that, we have merged a few sync fixes, and we have also we had a bug with get blobs v. 2, which we have fixed and merged into unstable so hopefully we will have a branch ready to go by the time like the fully fork happens on net 0.

185
00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.010
pawan: And that's it for us.

186
00:28:58.930 --> 00:28:59.930
Mario Vega: Thank you.

187
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.120
Mario Vega: Sunnyside labs. Do you want to talk about the the results.

188
00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:14.067
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah. Hi, so I'm Jay from Sunnyside Labs, and we've done some testings

189
00:29:15.211 --> 00:29:22.719
J Sunnyside Labs: as shared last week. And also there are some additional tests that we'd like to discuss. So

190
00:29:24.111 --> 00:29:38.060
J Sunnyside Labs: last week, we were investigating like where we are on pos in terms of like, how many number of blobs can we reach as a whole? So

191
00:29:38.832 --> 00:30:00.390
J Sunnyside Labs: we ran bit more nodes than the regional devnet, 7 back by. If so, we ran 60 nodes with 6 different cls and 3 different els, and we were able to reach up to nearly 50 blocks per block.

192
00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:02.389
J Sunnyside Labs: They

193
00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:18.470
J Sunnyside Labs: compared to the previous it's an achievement, we think, because, like previously, we couldn't even mix this many Ceos and Els together at all.

194
00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:21.769
J Sunnyside Labs: and we were able to reach like

195
00:30:22.090 --> 00:30:24.659
J Sunnyside Labs: the best results out of. Like

196
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:26.860
J Sunnyside Labs: all the dot nets we ran.

197
00:30:27.450 --> 00:30:38.060
J Sunnyside Labs: And we've after this update, we continued, looking into what can be

198
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:44.059
J Sunnyside Labs: improved so that we can reach 70 72 blobs per block.

199
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.263
J Sunnyside Labs: And then

200
00:30:47.230 --> 00:30:57.090
J Sunnyside Labs: we were looking at some bottlenecks and comparing like whether there's an impact on different stereo strategies on

201
00:30:58.354 --> 00:31:02.950
J Sunnyside Labs: get blobs v. 2 and like

202
00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:13.017
J Sunnyside Labs: the consequences of having gap blobs or not having gap blobs so far.

203
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:20.589
J Sunnyside Labs: There hasn't been much difference enabling or disabling. Get blobs

204
00:31:21.366 --> 00:31:24.099
J Sunnyside Labs: and we also found that

205
00:31:24.975 --> 00:31:30.240
J Sunnyside Labs: most of the Cls just request once per block

206
00:31:30.964 --> 00:31:34.409
J Sunnyside Labs: if they can't get it from p. 2 p. Network.

207
00:31:35.708 --> 00:31:38.920
J Sunnyside Labs: Only Granddyne was requesting more than once.

208
00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:43.303
J Sunnyside Labs: but we were not able to run

209
00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:47.539
J Sunnyside Labs: grander, grander and standalone to compare the resorts

210
00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:51.934
J Sunnyside Labs: because of, because it was a bit unstable.

211
00:31:52.550 --> 00:32:00.890
J Sunnyside Labs: But anyway, for lighthouse and prism, even with and without gaps they were

212
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:07.049
J Sunnyside Labs: achieving much higher than before, so which which were like

213
00:32:07.170 --> 00:32:18.049
J Sunnyside Labs: 53 blobs per block for lighthouse, which previously was 43, and 44 prison which previously was 25.

214
00:32:18.450 --> 00:32:19.130
J Sunnyside Labs: Yes.

215
00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:30.309
J Sunnyside Labs: So yeah, we will keep post like any updates and any findings we have from on the discord channel.

216
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:37.350
Parithosh Jayanthi: Did you guys happen to look into? Why get blobs? Wasn't making a big difference or

217
00:32:38.092 --> 00:32:43.580
Parithosh Jayanthi: yeah? Because that does. That seems a bit counterintuitive for a small network.

218
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:56.229
J Sunnyside Labs: And I think, we. I really wanted to test Granddyne because they were requesting more than once.

219
00:32:56.810 --> 00:33:04.090
J Sunnyside Labs: but I guess because it's a small network they were able to get it on via p. 2, p.

220
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:07.389
J Sunnyside Labs: We still have to look into it.

221
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:10.780
Parithosh Jayanthi: Okay, cool. Yeah.

222
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.420
Mario Vega: Thank you.

223
00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:30.149
pawan: I also had another question like, Did you also happen to test any syncing like any node in the network, like with a fresh sync, and if it caught up to head

224
00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.320
pawan: with these parameters.

225
00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.280
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah, syncing was a challenge, because

226
00:33:42.076 --> 00:33:49.860
J Sunnyside Labs: sometimes we have to restart the entire network, because many of the nodes fail to re-sync,

227
00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:59.239
J Sunnyside Labs: yeah. Is there a way that we can manually forward? Sync

228
00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:09.360
pawan: Yeah, you can do that on lighthouse, like you mean, try to sync without checkpoint sync, or

229
00:34:09.969 --> 00:34:11.550
pawan: didn't understand what you mean.

230
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.010
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah, at any point like, when

231
00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:21.269
J Sunnyside Labs: a node fails to catch up the chain.

232
00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:32.459
J Sunnyside Labs: Yeah, I I guess we can chat. Talk offline regarding like those kind of things.

233
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.921
Mario Vega: And there's a question about

234
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:51.639
Mario Vega: the resource utilization for super nodes. Whether you know what's the reason? Behind the high resource utilization in those super nodes.

235
00:34:54.060 --> 00:35:03.310
J Sunnyside Labs: High resource, utilization, and sorry one second.

236
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:21.020
Francesco: Yeah, like in the report. It says the super nodes were often running with like extremely high, like the CPU, being like very much utilized like utilizing like a ton of RAM. And like these kind of things, I was wondering if you maybe knew if it was like mostly due to column verification, or

237
00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:26.640
Francesco: or what? Exactly just because there had been already in the past this issue that it

238
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:44.870
Francesco: seem like column verification was much more expensive than it's supposed to be like, just by looking at what what the library should like. What are the verification times for the library? And so it's kind of. Yeah, I'm just wondering if that's still the problem, or if it's something else.

239
00:35:47.491 --> 00:35:54.069
J Sunnyside Labs: The resource utilization problem was particularly on lodestar supernodes.

240
00:35:54.915 --> 00:35:59.909
J Sunnyside Labs: It hasn't been an issue with other clients tested.

241
00:36:00.110 --> 00:36:05.420
Francesco: Oh, I see. Okay, yeah, I misread. I thought you just said I didn't realize it, said Lodestar.

242
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:08.410
J Sunnyside Labs: Right right sorry about that.

243
00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:09.330
J Sunnyside Labs: Don't know.

244
00:36:15.130 --> 00:36:20.188
Mario Vega: Thank you. And thanks for sharing the link. If anyone has further questions, I think we can.

245
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:29.140
Mario Vega: I'll take a look in into the report. And yeah, just reach out to sunset for questions.

246
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.277
Mario Vega: Yeah, thank you.

247
00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.179
Mario Vega: Is there anything else that we want to discuss regarding peer desk?

248
00:36:38.337 --> 00:36:53.169
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, I wanted to ask if there's some specific things client teams want us to be testing on 7 before we get rid of it. I think a natural test would be just making sure we can sync to head with all Cls

249
00:36:53.859 --> 00:36:56.979
Parithosh Jayanthi: besides that there anything else we should check.

250
00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:04.180
Manu: Yeah, I would say, thinking in boss.

251
00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.670
Manu: So in a network which is finalizing and not finalizing.

252
00:37:10.315 --> 00:37:14.240
Manu: I think it's important to test both, because sometimes.

253
00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:17.649
Manu: at least, it is the case in prism. The code pass.

254
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:22.579
Manu: He's not exactly the same when you want to sync in

255
00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:26.789
Manu: the finalizing plant compared to a non-finalizing plant.

256
00:37:27.610 --> 00:37:30.709
Manu: So, yes, would be useful to test this.

257
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:43.259
Parithosh Jayanthi: Yeah, sounds good. We can make it non finalized. We can do a basic sync test when it's finalizing, make it non finalizing and do another round of sync tests. I think that should be straightforward.

258
00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:48.320
Manu: And yeah, and especially also I, I said this for the previous devnet.

259
00:37:48.925 --> 00:37:53.194
Manu: I think it's important to run at least a few hours of

260
00:37:53.940 --> 00:38:00.919
Manu: blobs transaction before going to full, because there is a Electra

261
00:38:01.090 --> 00:38:08.950
Manu: to furloo transition which can cause some bugs as well, because Electra has blobs and Furloo has data columns.

262
00:38:10.884 --> 00:38:18.030
Parithosh Jayanthi: I was talking about Pierdas Devnet 7 up until now, so that one is the one we would be deprecating this week.

263
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:27.750
Manu: Yeah, yeah. But it's still a case. I mean, we, we can run Electra

264
00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:34.810
Manu: for a few hours in periods. Devnet 7, before activating, put up.

265
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:37.889
Manu: Or maybe I'm missing something.

266
00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.190
Parithosh Jayanthi: I mean Pietas 10 already. Has Hulu right.

267
00:38:42.838 --> 00:38:44.110
Manu: Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Okay.

268
00:38:46.282 --> 00:38:51.050
Parithosh Jayanthi: But I agree what what you're saying is, can we can apply the full second.

269
00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:52.177
Manu: So it's okay.

270
00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.539
Parithosh Jayanthi: You can do that. Yeah.

271
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.890
Mario Vega: There's a oh, yeah, sorry.

272
00:38:59.100 --> 00:38:59.946
Parithosh Jayanthi: One thing.

273
00:39:02.210 --> 00:39:10.429
Parithosh Jayanthi: Marius, I think we might need a malicious gets to to that right to create a block with cell block transactions.

274
00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:12.200
Marius: I can. I can build you one.

275
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.119
Parithosh Jayanthi: Awesome. Yeah, that's good.

276
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:19.940
Mario Vega: But could you? Could you expand a little bit more on what you mean? I didn't quite get it.

277
00:39:21.391 --> 00:39:23.678
Marius: So my idea is to send

278
00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:32.890
Marius: like as I, as I said in the interrupt chat, already we should try to make sure that all of the transaction pools are rejecting the

279
00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:38.969
Marius: the self-proof transactions before Furloo, and we made sure. But

280
00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:44.720
Marius: now we should create a block that has a transaction in that

281
00:39:45.356 --> 00:39:48.209
Marius: that has the set of rules. So if

282
00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:51.850
Marius: someone mines a faulty block with the with the El

283
00:39:52.340 --> 00:39:55.229
Marius: that those blocks get rejected by the CEO.

284
00:39:58.860 --> 00:39:59.560
Mario Vega: Yes, Francisco.

285
00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:00.310
Marius: Because.

286
00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:08.499
Francesco: But what does that mean with like, the the cell perfs would be in the network wrapper. So how could you even put them in the block.

287
00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:16.610
Marius: Well, I I mean with a with a transaction. Where this, where the network rapper is, is the

288
00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:22.720
Marius: the, the the new sub group.

289
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:33.250
Francesco: What I mean is like the like today. The current proof type doesn't go in the block anyway. So it would. It would be like.

290
00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:39.030
Francesco: I mean, you could somehow do it. But it would be like more than yeah.

291
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:40.687
Marius: It does go.

292
00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:47.930
Marius: and we don't really have a name for the for the object that we pass through the engine Api to the consensus layer.

293
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:48.810
Marius: It's.

294
00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.760
Francesco: Oh, in that sense. Okay, I see. Yeah, okay, I see what you mean. Yeah.

295
00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.930
Marius: Everyone. Yeah.

296
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.289
Francesco: Yeah, okay, I didn't understand. You meant through the engine. Api, okay, yeah.

297
00:40:56.880 --> 00:40:57.235
Marius: Yeah.

298
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.399
Mario Vega: But how? How the rest of the clients will detect this.

299
00:41:06.256 --> 00:41:14.220
Marius: The cl should reject the, doesn't it? This the proof.

300
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:22.209
pawan: I think it would be like a deserialization failure when you get it over the engine. Api.

301
00:41:22.770 --> 00:41:23.779
pawan: I did it.

302
00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:47.030
Mario Vega: I think we can explore also doing it in hive. We have a new type of testing in East that we basically use get blobs, but I think maybe we can tweak it a little bit to see if we can do this test case. I'm not sure, though I'm gonna I'm gonna check it in in East.

303
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:53.859
Marius: Well, yeah. But get blobs. That's different. Right? Like this is not the consensus path.

304
00:41:54.575 --> 00:42:04.040
Marius: Like, we should definitely make sure that if we return, share proofs on. Get blob v. 1 or or blob proofs on. Get blob. V. 2. Get blobs. V. 2.

305
00:42:04.631 --> 00:42:08.320
Marius: Then the the cl clients should reject them.

306
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:13.309
Marius: But this is more about like the consensus per.

307
00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.150
Mario Vega: Got it. Thank you.

308
00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:35.040
Mario Vega: Alright. Yeah, thank you. Thank you for that. Do we have anything else from peer for peer desk that we want to discuss.

309
00:42:49.350 --> 00:43:02.421
Mario Vega: if not the last topic that I have in the agenda is history expiry? I left this because we talked about it in the in the previous meeting. So maybe there was something left that we have to discuss.

310
00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:10.109
Mario Vega: But if not that, that's okay. Do we have anything that someone wants to share about the update in history. Expiry.

311
00:43:25.850 --> 00:43:27.729
Mario Vega: Okay? If if not,

312
00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:35.930
Mario Vega: is there anything else? Any other topics that we're missing from the agenda that anyone wants to bring up.

313
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:46.533
Mario Vega: Okay? Otherwise we can.

314
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:56.349
Mario Vega: yeah. The agenda is normally shared in the Pm repo

315
00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:02.299
Mario Vega: as an issue. So you can just look at their acdt. This is the current agenda.

316
00:44:03.062 --> 00:44:14.010
Mario Vega: Just go into the Pm. Repo, go to issues and just look up acdt, which is this meeting? And then you can either comment if you want to discuss something during the meeting

317
00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:21.154
Mario Vega: or yeah, you can revisit the topics afterwards. And there should be a and

318
00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:26.580
Mario Vega: basically meeting notes in here after the meeting also.

319
00:44:26.830 --> 00:44:27.610
Mario Vega: But yeah.

320
00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:40.169
Mario Vega: alright, yeah, if there's nothing else, I think we can wrap it up now, and just wait next couple of days that that net 0 is launched, and we can pick it up from there.

321
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:45.899
Mario Vega: See if there is any issues. Thank you. Thank you. Everyone have a nice day. Bye.

322
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:47.010
Parithosh Jayanthi: 18.

323
00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.569
Manu: Thank you. Bye.

324
00:44:47.570 --> 00:44:48.680
Dmitrii Shmatko: Take care bye.

325
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:49.270
ethDreamer (Mark): This guy is.

326
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.930
Marius: That's right.

327
00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:51.580
Ansgar Dietrichs: I have one.

328
00:44:52.130 --> 00:44:54.189
chanderprakash sharma: Bye, thank you, everyone. Bye-bye.

329
00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:16.770
chanderprakash sharma: Hi, Tim, are you still available?

330
00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.670
chanderprakash sharma: Hi, Tim.
