00:17:02	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Isn’t https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7918  SFI’d for fevnet-1?
00:17:22	Mario Vega:	Replying to "Isn’t https://eips.e..."

afaik yes
00:17:26	Dmitrii Shmatko:	Replying to "https://notes.ethere..."

https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4323  included? I’d clarify
00:18:18	Gabriel Trintinalia | Besu:	Replying to "https://notes.ethere..."

The list is missing eip-7918

I think you could start by reviewing some EIPs included in upcoming devnet

00:32:35	Csaba Kiraly:	You don’t really need getBlobs if all the block producers are powerful enough

00:33:12	Francesco:	Replying to "You don’t really nee..."

Also with small network + very high bandwidth
00:33:23	Csaba Kiraly:	If uplink BW is not constrained, getBlobs is not adding too much, just a small potential delay advantage by adding more sources at the CL
00:33:32	Minhyuk Kim:	I think our further tests will include nodes with degraded bandwidth / performance and see how getBlobs affects in those cases
00:33:39	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Reacted to "I think our further ..." with 👍🏽
00:33:57	Mario Vega:	Reacted to "I think our further ..." with 👍🏽
00:34:00	Marius:	Replying to "You don’t really nee..." 

 Also you can't rely on getBlobs, the network needs to work flawlessly without it
00:34:07	Csaba Kiraly:	Replying to "I think our further ..."

That’s what you need, otherwise you just test code efficiency and bugs.
00:34:22	Francesco:	Did you get a sense of what the problem was with supernodes? Specifically, is their really high resource consumption mostly due to column verification?
00:34:34	Marius:	Replying to "You don’t really nee..." 

 Its a great improvement for the happy case
00:34:37	Csaba Kiraly:	Replying to "I think our further ..."

Which is also very important :-)

00:35:42	pawan:	Reacted to "Which is also very i..." with 👍
00:36:12	Francesco:	No my bad
00:37:22	pawan:	Yeah sync testing would be super helpful! 🙏
00:37:24	Marius:	Can we try to create an el block with cell block txs
00:37:35	Minhyuk Kim:	Replying to "Did you get a sense ..."

In the past devnets (like a month ago), there were high consumption & time spent on those verifications which were due to bugs in certain clients; but those specific issues seem to be resolved now
00:37:35	Marius:	Make sure its rejected by the cls
00:38:22	Francesco:	Reacted to "In the past devnets ..." with 👍
00:38:23	Francesco:	Replying to "Did you get a sense ..."

great

sounds like you volunteered
00:43:44	chanderprakash sharma:	could any one tell what is agenda current meeting ? and before discussion I what things I have to see ?
