00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.060
spencer-tb: Hello!

2
00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:34.320
draganrakita: He'll….

3
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.070
Pooja Ranjan: Hello.

4
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:13.260
Mario Vega: Hello, hello?

5
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.620
Pooja Ranjan: Hello.

6
00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.010
Mario Vega: Let me give, a couple more minutes before we start to give…

7
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.539
Mario Vega: People a chance to… to join.

8
00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:17.929
Mario Vega: I think we can start. Yep.

9
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:35.300
Mario Vega: Awesome, thank you so much, Priya. Yeah, welcome everybody, this is ACDT number 49, today's August 18th.

10
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:45.960
Mario Vega: 2025, yeah, let's just get right into it. So the first item on the agenda is, Osaka.net.

11
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:55.650
Mario Vega: As I understand now, Fusaka.net 4 is down, what are the other updates, Barnos, if you… if you want to share?

12
00:09:56.510 --> 00:10:04.230
Barnabas: Right, so there are a few, Data 3 is still online, and we plan to keep it around for the foreseeable future.

13
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:16.299
Barnabas: We are slowly rolling out the images of the trend branches of different client teams. I think most of the ERs already, have everything in their master or main.

14
00:10:16.590 --> 00:10:24.650
Barnabas: And, we are waiting for the CL teams also to, start merging everything into their, developer branches.

15
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:35.019
Barnabas: And then once, that's done, then ideally we're gonna be, running .NET 5 as well, hopefully with, no more huge, changes.

16
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.640
Barnabas: No more spec changes needed.

17
00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.720
Barnabas: No more spec, clarifications are needed.

18
00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.319
Barnabas: So we are aiming to launch that, maybe next week, Tuesday.

19
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:55.669
Barnabas: Ideally, … Most client teams will have something by them in their master branches.

20
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:05.250
Mario Vega: Sounds great. Any oppositions on the timing? …

21
00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:13.069
Mario Vega: I don't think there's major updates that need to be done by clients, if I understand correctly. But is there anything that needs to be…

22
00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:16.109
Mario Vega: Done other than merging into main.

23
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.840
Mario Vega: From clients? Any concerns, basically?

24
00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.829
Mario Vega: One message, DevNet 5 should also be pretty weak, similar to DevNet 4. Okay.

25
00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:47.030
Mario Vega: Same BPO schedules, I would assume?

26
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:51.749
Mario Vega: Or it's gonna be different.

27
00:11:51.750 --> 00:12:01.169
Barnabas: We're gonna try to do the, nicer numbers with, 2 to 3, 2 to 3, so target, 2-2, to max value 3.

28
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:11.999
Barnabas: to have, … We have a better calculation for the, … what's the value called?

29
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:15.130
Mario Vega: The fraction?

30
00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.040
Barnabas: construction area.

31
00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.030
Mario Vega: Yeah, alright.

32
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:18.110
Mario Vega: Cool.

33
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.620
Mario Vega: Alright.

34
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.480
Mario Vega: Good. This is looking good. Okay, great. …

35
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:35.269
Mario Vega: Yeah. Alright, on the testing side, I can give an update. The next item is basically VPO site tests. We are almost ready.

36
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:50.640
Mario Vega: we have tagged a new release of East that we can use to test, the clients. So the approach is gonna be that we have now, tests with the exact same, scenario that happened on the W4 fork.

37
00:12:50.800 --> 00:13:02.679
Mario Vega: and other similar test cases and scenarios for that. So, we have tagged the version 1 for Devon 5, and it's currently building, and as soon as it's done.

38
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:06.699
Mario Vega: We're gonna, make the release, and then update Hive.

39
00:13:06.970 --> 00:13:17.950
Mario Vega: With this, we're gonna run the tests against all clients, and just verify that the BPO issue that was present in demo 4 is already fixed by everyone.

40
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:19.350
Mario Vega: …

41
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:29.759
Mario Vega: Yeah, that's basically the update on that. We'll keep you updated, and we'll try to update Hive as soon as possible to get the information out.

42
00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:41.389
Mario Vega: Alright, any comments on this, or either DevNets or static tests?

43
00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:43.099
Mario Vega: From any… anyone?

44
00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.350
Mario Vega: Yeah, right, I guess it's just waiting on… until Demet 5 for next week.

45
00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:03.180
Mario Vega: Alright, good. …

46
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:18.909
Mario Vega: Moving on, on gas limit testing updates, there was a point brought up by Ben, that we should discuss 60 million gas pre-Fusaka. Ben, do you want to, expand this?

47
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:27.700
Ben Adams: Yeah, so there's been a lot of work going on to improve the worst-case scenarios, … But…

48
00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:29.669
Ben Adams: will be fixed.

49
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.900
Ben Adams: We, post Osaka through repricing.

50
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.070
Ben Adams: But…

51
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:42.840
Ben Adams: sort of… I'm trying to gauge people's thoughts on going to 60 million, as was originally planned, briefly, so…

52
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.570
Ben Adams: Anybody has any thoughts?

53
00:14:50.890 --> 00:15:03.490
Justin Florentine (Besu): Hey Ben, this is, Justin from Bayesu Team. I don't have all the details, happy to engage offline with them. We had some concerns with EC Recover, between 45 and 60 million gas.

54
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:22.679
Kamil Chodoła: Do you mean some particular scenario for EC Recover? Because from opcode testing, it was quite fast… fast enough to consider 60.

55
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:35.930
Justin Florentine (Besu): I don't wanna… I don't wanna derail this. I know that there's a separate conversation happening on Telegram. I just wanted to raise the…

56
00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.079
Justin Florentine (Besu): issue that Bayesu has some hesitancy about going to 60 million gas.

57
00:15:44.290 --> 00:16:03.059
Kamil Chodoła: So, from my perspective only, if I can chime in now, is that there are just a few things which we still need to consider. It's like, Modex performance before Fusaka repricings, is that GEF still is working on improvements.

58
00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.950
Kamil Chodoła: There was one attempt, …

59
00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:13.800
Kamil Chodoła: Which was showing quite significant improvements, but was causing some regressions in other places, so there still need to be some work being done here.

60
00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:22.319
Kamil Chodoła: And yeah, I guess we'll discuss that a little bit this week, to see what else can be done, and how we can help them testing that out.

61
00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:34.359
Kamil Chodoła: Other thing is that we integrated EST tests and benchmark tests. On version 3 of those benchmarks, we noticed quite a lot of slow scenarios for Bezu.

62
00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:42.859
Kamil Chodoła: Which already we are in touch with by the team here, so… it was more specifically about, Mot Aris.

63
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:50.700
Kamil Chodoła: scenarios, but yeah, this needs to be analyzed. Maybe this is some other inputs in tests, which we maybe should analyze.

64
00:16:50.920 --> 00:17:05.800
Kamil Chodoła: But anyways, this is done, and also there is a new version of benchmarks, which we integrated, but it's having one quite significant regression, which is causing tests to basically kill the nodes.

65
00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:23.790
Kamil Chodoła: So… yeah, but this is not, like, it is slow on some particular example, on some small gas limits, but by mistake, EST tests are enabling some very, very huge blocks in giga gas. So yeah, so this might actually crash.

66
00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:28.400
Kamil Chodoła: And yeah, last thing, which would be stateful testing.

67
00:17:28.450 --> 00:17:31.379
Kamil Chodoła: Which I'm working on exactly right now.

68
00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:46.620
Kamil Chodoła: is to enable a way on how to write and execute stateful tests on top of mainnet and bloatnet, and reproduce, for example, Xen scenarios or other heavy state access scenarios.

69
00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:55.060
Kamil Chodoła: And see how impactful those will be, and, like, at least open this branch of scenarios for reproducible tension testing.

70
00:17:55.330 --> 00:18:01.519
Kamil Chodoła: But yeah, hopefully this week I will have something to share with Carlos Perez to work on new scenarios out there.

71
00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:08.859
Kamil Chodoła: But yeah, most specifically, the most important issues right now with 60, which I see, is ModeX with GEF.

72
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.779
Kamil Chodoła: And, some new scenarios found for Bezos.

73
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.710
Mario Vega: Excellent.

74
00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:34.270
Mario Vega: So, a question from Tim on the chat is that, given EC recovery prices aren't going to be changing in Fusaka, is this a blocker for you post-fork? It sounds from Ben that it isn't, but, …

75
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:38.980
Mario Vega: Maybe we'll want to dig a little bit deeper onto that?

76
00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:44.810
Mario Vega: Repricing is your programming?

77
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:52.740
Tim Beiko: Yeah, that question was for… for Bay2, yeah, not for, Nethermine, like, if, … Like, yeah, …

78
00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:57.580
Tim Beiko: Is there a… plan. Like, basically, like, yeah, if…

79
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:04.949
Tim Beiko: Is there something that, like, at the client level, you think you can do to, to, improve this, or, …

80
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:10.839
Tim Beiko: Do we, like, actually need a repricing to… To, fix these issues.

81
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:30.410
Justin Florentine (Besu): Right, so I'm not running point on the gas refricing issue at the moment, so I can't really speak to that, but I do know that we have multiple opcodes, as well as the modics pre-compile, that we worry about transitioning from 45 million gas to 60 million gas. That is, …

82
00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:37.509
Justin Florentine (Besu): a performance problem for us that, you know, we're currently working on it, and we're trying to optimize it, but, you know, it's a known issue.

83
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:39.090
Mario Vega: Yeah.

84
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:43.600
Mario Vega: Yeah, Camille?

85
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:51.199
Kamil Chodoła: So yeah, so looking at the data from EC, there is a EC ad scenarios which are particularly slow for Bezel.

86
00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:52.670
Kamil Chodoła: …

87
00:19:52.940 --> 00:20:02.199
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, looking at the other clients, those scenarios are way much higher, and the slowest one for best-looking right now is, like, 23 megabits per second.

88
00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:14.519
Kamil Chodoła: So, yeah, up for discussion, but for 60, it will be slower, but it won't reach, like, even 3 seconds blocks.

89
00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.070
Kamil Chodoła: What would be good, yeah, as Marius is mentioning, to get, like, a…

90
00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:26.819
Kamil Chodoła: There's a team statement to get exactly what… maybe there is something which we are missing here, and we should test more deeply.

91
00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:37.390
Mario Vega: I think, Camille, if you can share the results that you're looking at with the best of team and with everyone, I think that that would be very helpful.

92
00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.239
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, I will bump it up on our Discord channel with Caslimid testing.

93
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:49.810
Mario Vega: Awesome.

94
00:20:50.910 --> 00:21:09.150
Mario Vega: Alright, so it seems like we have to do more analysis based on the results. Is there any other concerns from other client teams, regarding gas limits? Do we need more benchmarking? Do we need more information, or what's the current stance from everybody else?

95
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:14.719
Mario Vega: I see Rev on the call, … Does anybody have any opinion?

96
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.179
Mario Vega: Alright, Red says no concern.

97
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.920
Mario Vega: Anybody from Ericon?

98
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.010
Mario Vega: No concern, okay.

99
00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:44.490
Mario Vega: And Marius mentions that we need more benchmarking with regards to state, and… Yep.

100
00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:51.750
Mario Vega: Maurice, do you want to expand on that, or…?

101
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.390
Mario Vega: On SnapSync?

102
00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:54.650
Marius van der Wijden: After yours?

103
00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.239
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, so…

104
00:21:56.640 --> 00:22:08.689
Marius van der Wijden: I don't know that much about it, but, apparently we're running, periodical snap syncs on these networks, and for Perth DevNet 2.

105
00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:10.910
Marius van der Wijden: All clients failed.

106
00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:16.839
Marius van der Wijden: To SnapSync within 70 hours, and, that is with it.

107
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:22.269
Marius van der Wijden: Network that is twice mainnet size, so it's not that much bigger.

108
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:32.559
Marius van der Wijden: So that is something that all clients should be aware of, and should look into what's happening on their client, and I can send some…

109
00:22:33.610 --> 00:22:38.980
Marius van der Wijden: more… Info in the chat.

110
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.160
Mario Vega: So through… Respond to answers…

111
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:59.059
Mario Vega: con… comment, we… I think this is a work in progress. So right now, we're trying to unify.

112
00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:02.859
Mario Vega: Most of the tests into execution spec tests.

113
00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:11.059
Mario Vega: And we're trying to make releases to make consistent testing across all the clients, but the framework is not perfect yet.

114
00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:25.080
Mario Vega: mainly we don't have stateful tests in East, because it's hard for them to produce. So we're still working on a way to have this unified. But I think at the end game, or the final…

115
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:26.360
Mario Vega: …

116
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:40.909
Mario Vega: the final, like, benchmark testing that we have is all unified in East, and we can, like, take the same measurements per team… on each client, I'm sorry, on all clients, using the same tests, yeah.

117
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:50.309
Ansgar Dietrichs: Yeah, that sounds good, and I wasn't trying to imply that we should already be there, right? Like, I think that's… that is a big project, so I was just curious, kind of, what the current state is.

118
00:23:50.310 --> 00:24:08.459
Ansgar Dietrichs: I do think a nice goal eventually would be to basically get to a place where these are reliable enough that they actually give us confident visibility into blockers and bottlenecks, right? Because I do think right now we're still in this position where sometimes it's very hard to say, okay.

119
00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:23.600
Ansgar Dietrichs: this looks good on all clients, but then maybe the way these benchmarks were done didn't account for all the client-specific problems, and so then, out of quote-unquote nowhere, at least from the kind of top-level view, new problems emerge, and so I think really trying to get to

120
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:28.650
Ansgar Dietrichs: the highest visibility possible, I think would be really, really valuable.

121
00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.189
Mario Vega: Yeah, completely agree. So, and just to highlight,

122
00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:47.240
Mario Vega: So the latest version that Camille mentions is… it added a lot of tests from Eastside. So I think that's one of the reasons why we spotted new things.

123
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:55.709
Mario Vega: But I think, the longer that we go on East testing, the less new tests that we're gonna see, and it's gonna be more stable.

124
00:24:55.870 --> 00:25:04.459
Mario Vega: So yeah, just to summarize, we have many new tests now, and I think that's the reason why we catch some things that we didn't catch before, in my opinion.

125
00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:06.099
Mario Vega: Yeah, Camille?

126
00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:24.310
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, and just exactly to that, the tests which we run right now, not yet on the desired machines, but on the side, on weaker machines that actually we use, EC Recover is, from EST test suit, is performing at 60 megabits per second for all of the clients.

127
00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:26.170
Kamil Chodoła: At least 60 megabz.

128
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:32.570
Kamil Chodoła: So, not sure why I need to understand a little bit more what exactly is the thing about EC Recover.

129
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:33.650
Kamil Chodoła: Here.

130
00:25:35.250 --> 00:25:45.080
Mario Vega: Also, if we can take a look at your… your specific tests that you are running for easy recover on Bisu, I think it will be very good.

131
00:25:45.110 --> 00:25:56.089
Mario Vega: that we can import them into East to have them in this benchmark test set, so we can run them against all clients. So maybe there's a blind spot in our tests, specifically for East Recovery that we're not seeing.

132
00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:58.490
Mario Vega: … Yep.

133
00:25:58.950 --> 00:26:12.790
Justin Florentine (Besu): So I don't want to, bias this too much towards EC Recover. I think it's… it is an issue. I, again, I don't have the details on that. I think it's the, ModiXP stuff, though, that is more of a concern.

134
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:26.390
Justin Florentine (Besu): So we have specific, just to elaborate here, we have 9 opcodes and the mod EXP precompile that are below 20 million gas, 20 mega gas.

135
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:28.290
Justin Florentine (Besu): So that's… that's…

136
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:33.639
Justin Florentine (Besu): more the area of focus that we need to address if we want to consider raising gas limit before Fusaka.

137
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:49.390
Mario Vega: Of course, yeah. In any way, I think if you can share the benchmark tests, just so we can also write a similar test for East, I think that would be great, just to make sure that we're not missing anything.

138
00:26:49.770 --> 00:26:51.110
Mario Vega: Yep.

139
00:26:53.810 --> 00:26:56.400
Mario Vega: Who can we reach out from Besu's side?

140
00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:02.770
Mario Vega: sorry, who can we reach from Beso's side to… that has the details on this specific.

141
00:27:02.770 --> 00:27:15.829
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, Mezian Hamlot, who's currently out for August, is our performance engineer, but Simon Dudley has been doing a lot of this testing as well. He's in the Australian time zone, though, so he doesn't usually make these calls.

142
00:27:18.330 --> 00:27:24.430
Mario Vega: Excellent. We try to reach him async, just to see if we can implement the same test in East, yeah.

143
00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.529
Mario Vega: Camille, yeah?

144
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:33.129
Kamil Chodoła: So, yeah, just last question, by 20 megas, you mean 20MGAS per second performance?

145
00:27:36.430 --> 00:27:37.120
Justin Florentine (Besu): Yes.

146
00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:54.720
Kamil Chodoła: Okay, yeah, so here is, yeah, all for the decision if 20 megah is something which we want to treat right now as a security concern, or we should fit into, like, 4-second execution time.

147
00:27:55.030 --> 00:28:01.130
Kamil Chodoła: So, based on that, the decision should be made. Like, best would be, of course, to be below, even 2.

148
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:02.810
Kamil Chodoła: But, yeah.

149
00:28:03.150 --> 00:28:09.300
Kamil Chodoła: ModeXP, as I can see for now, for sure, there is some work needs to be done for GEF.

150
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:18.010
Kamil Chodoła: Where we have 15, or something like that, while Bezu's slowest scenario, which we have right now for Bezu on our end, is 19.

151
00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:28.019
Kamil Chodoła: And whenever I was thinking about any potential…

152
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.849
Kamil Chodoła: increase. It would be that it would be good to be…

153
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:35.590
Kamil Chodoła: But worst scenario is not above 3 seconds.

154
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.670
Kamil Chodoła: And surely not above, or close to 4.

155
00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.080
Kamil Chodoła: With GAF, it is for exactly.

156
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.970
Kamil Chodoła: With Bezos, it will be close to free.

157
00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.249
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

158
00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:56.520
Mario Vega: …

159
00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:08.710
Mario Vega: And yeah, Luis from East, team, he shared a… the links to the exact test that we're running on Eastside. So yeah, just for reference.

160
00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:10.690
Mario Vega: If anybody wants to take a look.

161
00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:20.589
Mario Vega: All right, cool. Anything else on benchmarking, or we can move on to the next, … Next topic.

162
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:31.680
Kamil Chodoła: One thing only for me, that whenever any client team or anyone here listening is building any new scenarios or any new tools, please maybe consider at first.

163
00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.770
Kamil Chodoła: to work on EST benchmarking approach.

164
00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:41.240
Kamil Chodoła: So, this way, we'll be able to run it on our existing infrastructure and verify it against all of the clients.

165
00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:50.050
Kamil Chodoła: Even recently, if Efrex from Lambda team, Lambda Class team is joined, so they are also being verified right now.

166
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:59.590
Kamil Chodoła: So it would be really cool to follow that approach moving forward, rather than creating separate tools, because it will add additional level of complexity to integrate everything.

167
00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.270
Mario Vega: Makes sense. Perfect. Yeah, thank you so much.

168
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:11.840
Mario Vega: Cool. Alright, before jumping into…

169
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:21.080
Mario Vega: The next topic is Sunnyside Lives, but I think there's a quick topic that Barnabas just brought up about the PR that has to be merged.

170
00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.309
Mario Vega: When I shared the link?

171
00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:29.180
Mario Vega: Here, Barnabas, anything that you want to add to this, this PR?

172
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:30.480
Mario Vega: Any comments?

173
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:46.200
Barnabas: Yeah, so my general comments would be that ideally, we want to be able to locally test blood numbers over 32 as well, and this limitation, is, present in the minimal preset only, so this is a CL-only change.

174
00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:53.779
Barnabas: I don't even want to pump this to the team that uses mainnet, so we can test a larger number of,

175
00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.290
Barnabas: Blob's throughput as well.

176
00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:58.599
Barnabas: Please take a look and, …

177
00:30:58.930 --> 00:31:02.470
Barnabas: Approve it if you want, and argue if you don't.

178
00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:12.729
Barnabas: And ideally, they should make it into the full releases. We're gonna… if everybody agrees, then we can include it in Alpha 5 release with Justin.

179
00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:20.239
Justin Florentine (Besu): Sorry, Barnabas, was that for me?

180
00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:22.840
Barnabas: This is for CLW.

181
00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.119
Mario Vega: CL specs, just in… just in trouble.

182
00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:35.999
stokes: Is there any reason to not do this, Barnabas?

183
00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.050
Barnabas: Not that I can see.

184
00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.090
stokes: Okay.

185
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:46.219
stokes: Yeah, it seems fine, just from a first pass.

186
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.140
stokes: For me.

187
00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:54.669
Barnabas: The only reason not to do it is, it's so late.

188
00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.060
Barnabas: But that's about it.

189
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:04.030
Mario Vega: Alright.

190
00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:11.380
Mario Vega: Yeah, please comment and approve if we are moving forward, or was just, … leave the comments.

191
00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.999
Mario Vega: Alright, thank you.

192
00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:17.289
Mario Vega: The next topic is Sunnyside Labs.

193
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.650
Mario Vega: …

194
00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:26.719
Mario Vega: Yeah, I just wanted to put this point here, if there's anything to share, but I'm not sure if anyone from Sunnyside has joined the call.

195
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.670
Mario Vega: Or if there is any updates.

196
00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:32.670
Minhyuk Kim: Oh, yeah, I, ….

197
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.480
Mario Vega: Thank you.

198
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:46.099
Minhyuk Kim: I'm Mina from SciSight Labs. We don't have anything much new since last week, except for this report that we put out on Discord last week, so please check it out if you haven't, and…

199
00:32:46.650 --> 00:32:47.509
Minhyuk Kim: Thank you.

200
00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:51.840
Mario Vega: Excellent. Thanks.

201
00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:04.010
Mario Vega: All right. Yeah, and, the last topic… …

202
00:33:04.530 --> 00:33:13.130
Mario Vega: is the sephe discussion. I think Mikhail raised this on… ACDE last week.

203
00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:19.950
Mario Vega: But I'm really not sure if there's any updates on that, or if Mikhail can comment on this topic.

204
00:33:22.390 --> 00:33:30.889
Mario Vega: So, I just added it to have a follow-up discussion today, but if there's not news on this, or if there's no one here that can comment on this.

205
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:38.049
Mario Vega: … Let me share the link to the comment in the chat.

206
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.299
Mario Vega: this discussion I'm referring to.

207
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:47.850
Mario Vega: Basically, the safe head, …

208
00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:58.820
Mario Vega: on the… on the EL clients, there was a discussion at the last ACDE, about changing the semantics or the behavior of this endpoint.

209
00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:07.129
Mario Vega: … Is there anybody here that has more, context on this, or any updates on this topic?

210
00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:33.449
Mario Vega: Seems like not.

211
00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:38.960
Mario Vega: Yeah, we can follow up this topic on the ACDE, I assume.

212
00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:49.709
Mario Vega: Alright, that was the last topic in the agenda for today. Anything else that anybody wants to bring up, or any concerns?

213
00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.370
Mario Vega: About any other topic?

214
00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.840
Mario Vega: Going once… Going twice.

215
00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:20.380
Marius van der Wijden: I have something really quick. I just looked through the benchmarks, and I noticed that Keth and Aragon are at 30… 30, 33 million gas for the point evaluation precompile.

216
00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:24.490
Marius van der Wijden: So… I think it's probably…

217
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.889
Marius van der Wijden: would be nice for those teams, us and Aragon, to look into this.

218
00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.320
Marius van der Wijden: Because those are the only cases

219
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:41.790
Marius van der Wijden: Significantly below 60 megabytes per second, for those clients. So, point evaluation precompile.

220
00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:54.379
Kamil Chodoła: Isn't it that it is more or less the same performance for all of the clients, because of how it works right now?

221
00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.920
Kamil Chodoła: And the only way to improve that would be to just reprice it.

222
00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:08.690
Marius van der Wijden: Is it? I don't know, I didn't look at the other clients.

223
00:36:09.940 --> 00:36:16.719
Kamil Chodoła: just opening that right now, but as far as I recall, this performs almost identically for all of the clients.

224
00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:21.529
Marius van der Wijden: That's probably because they use the KZG library for it, right?

225
00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:28.580
Marcin Sobczak: Yeah, I recall the sign. It was about 50 to 52 megabits per second for all the clients.

226
00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:52.450
Marius van der Wijden: But I… I don't see it in the Netherland chart, so… I don't know.

227
00:36:53.620 --> 00:37:00.759
Kamil Chodoła: Nethermind is there, but … for some reason, we have warming enabled for that scenario.

228
00:37:01.590 --> 00:37:05.550
Kamil Chodoła: Yeah, and this throws Netherland quite high on the chart.

229
00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:08.460
Marius van der Wijden: Okay.

230
00:37:09.490 --> 00:37:15.490
Kamil Chodoła: But without it, it will be also on the same level, as I recall from the past results.

231
00:37:15.890 --> 00:37:20.810
Kamil Chodoła: Just some recent merge, … Make it, again, fast.

232
00:37:21.190 --> 00:37:28.410
Marius van der Wijden: Yeah, I think that this is probably a case for optimizing CKZG.

233
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.490
Marius van der Wijden: And or repricing the party valuation pre-compan.

234
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:38.030
Mario Vega: Do we need.

235
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:40.029
Kamil Chodoła: I mean,

236
00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:46.189
Mario Vega: Oh, sorry, I just want to mention if we are missing any cases on this, on the east.

237
00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.509
Kamil Chodoła: The scenario is performing exactly the same.

238
00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:51.440
Mario Vega: So far.

239
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.449
Kamil Chodoła: identical, ours and East, exactly the same.

240
00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:58.209
Kamil Chodoła: Both with same performance, …

241
00:37:59.050 --> 00:38:07.890
Kamil Chodoła: Just that, at least with my assumption that it is more or less around 32, 33 megacity per second.

242
00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:12.719
Kamil Chodoła: It does not much violate the rule of 3-4 second blocks.

243
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.510
Kamil Chodoła: It's on 3 seconds, actually.

244
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:22.929
Kamil Chodoła: So, yet to be, maybe, considered, how much it affects the 100 goal, or something.

245
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:32.170
Kamil Chodoła: We can bring it to the discussion.

246
00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.879
Kamil Chodoła: To consider it moving forward.

247
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:40.120
Kamil Chodoła: But definitely, if we want to go higher, we need to consider either some optimizations in the library.

248
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:43.209
Kamil Chodoła: As we all use the same one?

249
00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:46.680
Kamil Chodoła: Or repricing for Glamsterdam?

250
00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:07.580
Barnabas: One more note, could every, EL try to think to proof that too, and see locally what kind of problems you're facing?

251
00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:15.849
Barnabas: Because none of them… none of the clients being able to sync on our sync test seems to be…

252
00:39:16.010 --> 00:39:19.570
Barnabas: There might be some other underlying issue.

253
00:39:30.330 --> 00:39:31.900
Kamil Chodoła: We're looking at mine for us.

254
00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:42.170
Mario Vega: Thank you. Alright.

255
00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.700
Mario Vega: Anything else?

256
00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:55.060
Mario Vega: It seems like we have to take a look at these, benchmark results, unify, and …

257
00:39:55.460 --> 00:40:00.719
