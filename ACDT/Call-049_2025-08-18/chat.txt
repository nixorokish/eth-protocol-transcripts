00:11:35	Marius van der Wijden:	All good on our side
00:11:35	Barnabas:	similar to devnet 4
00:17:04	Tim Beiko:	@Besu, given ecrecover prices aren’t changing in Fusaka, is that a blocker for you post-fork, too?

00:21:20	Roman:	no concern re going to 60m
00:21:27	Marius van der Wijden:	I think we need more benchmarking re state

00:21:50	Marius van der Wijden:	not at the moment
00:22:32	Ansgar Dietrichs:	question: how much is benchmarking unified across clients yet, vs requires specific per-client context knowledge? e.g. my understanding is the ecrecover besu performance concerns didn’t show up in the cross-client benchmarks we did coming out of interop? why is that
00:22:49	Barnabas:	test run that failed: https://github.com/ethpandaops/perf-devnets/actions/runs/16961730639
00:22:49	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "question: how much i..."

seems like there would be a lot of value in getting to reliable cross-client benchmarks
00:25:07	Ben Adams:	No issue with 60M for Nethermind, just to complete the record 🙂

00:25:23	Louis:	Replying to "question: how much i..."

I think the problem is that in interop we use gas-benchmarks repo for benchmarking, but we also have benchmarking in EEST using by zkEVM at that time. The testing approach for them are different, I think the reason might be we use zkEVM test for measurement now
00:25:28	draganrakita:	Btw block gas limit is not hardcoded and does not require hard fork, on standpoint of risks if there is a problem with 60m we can always reduce it
00:26:55	Louis:	This is the benchmark in EEST for ecrecover: https://github.com/ethereum/execution-spec-tests/blob/9765b9110689ab3f25ba8d46bd223d9553e746f6/tests/benchmark/test_worst_compute.py#L1688
00:30:21	Marius van der Wijden:	Can we get client teams to compile a list what is preventing them from going to 100M post fusaka
00:30:23	Mario Vega:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4508
00:31:39	pawan:	Looks good to me
00:31:44	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "Can we get client ..."

devp2p receipts over 10 MiB is a problem at some point post 60M due to the logs > 10 MB. So would then need the devp2p partial messages https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7975 or log repricing to ensure Receipts response does not exceed the 10 MB

interesting - but if the results are different, we should understand why that is, no?

Thuis is exactly what we raised on Besu Nethermind TG group :)

So will work with you guys on testing of that :)
00:39:47	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "question: how much i..."

ultimately “how many iterations of precompile X can you execute in 1s” should have a deterministic answer per client (and on set hardware)
00:40:31	Louis:	Replying to "question: how much i..."

Yes I agree
