00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.820
Akash | ECH: Hey! Hello!

2
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.479
Pooja Ranjan: Hello, Akash, so we don't need to change any setting, and it should work for both platforms simultaneously, right.

3
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.870
Akash | ECH: Yeah, yeah.

4
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:42.340
Pooja Ranjan: Okay, cool so I just have selected fossil breakout 15. And let's see if it works there.

5
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.930
Pooja Ranjan: I'm going to start the stream for starting soon transition.

6
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.039
Pooja Ranjan: and let me know if it comes out right.

7
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.950
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are live on both the platforms.

8
00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.850
Pooja Ranjan: Awesome. Thank you.

9
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.590
Akash | ECH: We can.

10
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.220
Jihoon: Hello!

11
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:09.799
Jihoon: I think we can wait like one more minute and then start the call

12
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:55.489
Jihoon: alright. I think we can start the call. Thanks for joining us. Hello, everyone! Welcome to the 15th possible breakout.

13
00:07:56.385 --> 00:08:02.314
Jihoon: Toma is here, but he cannot stay longer, so I will be running this breakout.

14
00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.639
Jihoon: So I want to share

15
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:13.000
Jihoon: few updates. Yeah, thank you, Toma, I want to share a few things related to call Amsterdam. And then

16
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:18.679
Jihoon: we can move to implementation updates. And then, if anything else

17
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:22.690
Jihoon: that I haven't added to the agenda, we can also talk about them.

18
00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:32.510
Jihoon: Firstly, as many of us here might already know. You can express your preferences of the headliner for Glimpster Diamond Forecast.

19
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:39.600
Jihoon: Here's a link, and at the Acd call

20
00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:49.050
Jihoon: we briefly talked about the headliner for Clemsterdam. And we realized we want to have more opinions from client teams and the community.

21
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:56.529
Jihoon: So please make a vote and let it be heard via Discord Twitter, or, as it calls.

22
00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:00.349
Jihoon: here's another link you might want to share your preferences.

23
00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:10.310
Jihoon: I also want to re-emphasize why, we need fossil, even though the censorship today has gotten better.

24
00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:16.390
Jihoon: We are seeing less censorship because up builders are not censoring for whatever reason.

25
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:23.859
Jihoon: but ethereum is vulnerable to censorship threat if top builders were to turn on their censorship again.

26
00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.319
Jihoon: Not censoring and hand censoring are fundamentally different.

27
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:35.019
Jihoon: Ethereum censorship. Resistance can be swayed by the opinions of a few

28
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:41.020
Jihoon: fossil is not a Bonancia, but it does improve censorship resistance by far.

29
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:54.310
Jihoon: so Glimpster. Time is probably a good fork to ship censorship resistance, and we can still ship other proposals that that scale l. 1 l. 2, and improve. Ux.

30
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:02.400
Jihoon: Lastly, let me share an update regarding the epbs and fossil compatibility.

31
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.079
Jihoon: We have a new article written by Toma

32
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:21.770
Jihoon: with the Pbs. Bag is being updated by potos. The compatibility between the Pbs and fossil is also revisited. The article provides the up-to-date ideas about the compatibility it uses the Irbit list.

33
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:28.050
Jihoon: It's a bit list indicates the Ils that a builder considered when building a block.

34
00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:36.890
Jihoon: If I were to provide a clunky summary of it. Please feel free to jump in. Don't mind if I'm making some wrong explanation.

35
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:52.800
Jihoon: Testers validate. If a payload for previous slot satisfy the il constraints, and check if the il bit list of a beacon block for current slot is a superset of their subjective il view.

36
00:10:53.130 --> 00:11:02.449
Jihoon: In this way we can leverage the whole Beacon Committee for the Irp List inclusivity check, but on alternatively

37
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:10.129
Jihoon: we can decide to let Pdc. Perform it. This allows us to reorg a payload instead of a peacom block

38
00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:13.810
Jihoon: when it fails, the inclusivity check

39
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:23.559
Jihoon: while this give us better liveness. Are we going to rely on Ptc. Instead of the whole taken committee for the inclusivity. Check.

40
00:11:24.206 --> 00:11:29.720
Jihoon: So it boils down to the trade off for more details. Please take a look into the article.

41
00:11:30.985 --> 00:11:34.209
Jihoon: Next up is implementation updates

42
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.469
Jihoon: before we jump into it. Does anyone have any questions or comments?

43
00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:58.739
Jihoon: I guess we're good. So let me just continue. I guess the implementation updates will be mostly about back.

44
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:09.310
Jihoon: But please feel free to jump in and share if you have any other updates. So in the previous breakout call, we discussed about how to specify the

45
00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:18.569
Jihoon: see. A spec. Afterward I shared a write-up. That explains what were the problems. And what are the possible solutions.

46
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:44.420
Jihoon: thanks to detailed feedback from Mikhail just in a medi, or we were able to find a much better way to write us back. So now the Pr has updated. And now I'm working on the El Spec. In the meantime, I guess people will be busy with other stuff like Fusaka. But can we have more eyes on the Pr. And Margit? If it's okay, let me share the link to the Pr in the chat.

47
00:12:45.943 --> 00:12:57.289
Jihoon: Yeah. So merging it into the into into this main branch would allow me to reason my work on the sales spectas. So yes, Justin.

48
00:12:57.969 --> 00:13:00.159
Justin Traglia: Yeah, I would love to get this merged in soon, too.

49
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:02.020
Jihoon: Thank you.

50
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:07.959
Justin Traglia: I'll give it a proper review today, and then maybe wait for my file to give his review. And then merge.

51
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.880
Justin Traglia: Or is that great? Thanks.

52
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:13.010
Jihoon: Yeah, okay, cool.

53
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:23.909
Jihoon: Yep. So that's all from my end. Does anyone have any other updates, thoughts, comments, or feedback?

54
00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:52.050
Jihoon: I guess today's breakout is quite

55
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:57.500
Jihoon: nice and neat. Maybe tomorrow you wanna say something.

56
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:12.619
Jihoon: Otherwise we can, just, you know, call it a day, and then see each other after 2 weeks.

57
00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:23.471
Jihoon: Oh, right so in a chat, Thomas says.

58
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.099
Jihoon: Curious to hear if people have opinions on fossil

59
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.230
Jihoon: and call Amsterdam so in a twitter. We are seeing

60
00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:42.599
Jihoon: people are expressing their preferences on what should be the headliner for Amsterdam, and they are, you know.

61
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:51.890
Jihoon: putting eips in different ranks from S to D. Some people put fossil on S. Some people put it on d

62
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.570
Jihoon: can we have some, you know.

63
00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.890
Jihoon: as people hear about what their preference is

64
00:15:12.310 --> 00:15:13.829
Jihoon: right, so

65
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:50.659
Jihoon: right, and it would be valuable if you could let us know if you don't think that fossil should be shipped in Glamsterdam. Then I'd be curious curious to learn why.

66
00:15:51.382 --> 00:16:01.950
Jihoon: Because, yeah, it is it because of the proposal itself, or is because, you know, like it touches so many things from cl to el? Or is it because of

67
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:10.269
Jihoon: a priority priority, as in the 3 goals of the Ef scale l. 1 l. 2, and improve ux or whatnot.

68
00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:27.270
Justin Traglia: Oh, I have a dumb question. Forecast isn't like an official voting mechanism that doesn't track anything. You're just like. It would share the screenshot on Twitter or something.

69
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:29.870
Justin Traglia: Or is there a better way?

70
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:32.470
Justin Traglia: Okay, it's not.

71
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.929
Justin Traglia: It would be nice if there were some

72
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.529
Justin Traglia: more formal voting mechanism where it was like public.

73
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.690
Justin Traglia: Okay. Another time.

74
00:17:04.030 --> 00:17:10.220
thomasthiery: Okay, I I mean, it's probably where I can talk a bit. But yeah, I think

75
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:17.349
thomasthiery: I think there are pros. And and against official voting mechanisms, and that will necessarily like

76
00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:35.329
thomasthiery: need to buy in from most of the people, and like a whole sort of like rethinking around governance. I think the Str list is more. Yeah, informal way of stating preferences. That is a bit more fun and nice. But yeah, shouldn't be considered like a

77
00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:40.919
thomasthiery: like an actual thing. I think it's still nice to share. And just because even for me.

78
00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:45.990
thomasthiery: you know, I've been less involved in other proposals, and just like

79
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.490
thomasthiery: trying to look at Stl's. It actually forced me to to look more into the

80
00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:57.600
thomasthiery: some of the other ones I like didn't know much about which was nice.

81
00:17:59.690 --> 00:18:05.140
thomasthiery: But but yeah shouldn't be taken very, very seriously.

82
00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.680
Jihoon: Fair point. Acd calls are the official channel. If I'm not wrong.

83
00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.500
thomasthiery: Yeah, exactly.

84
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:20.990
Jihoon: Yes.

85
00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:30.039
thomasthiery: And yeah, maybe to reformulate or to the question. I just wonder if, like anyone here has

86
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:37.489
thomasthiery: concerns about the mechanism, or if it's just a matter of priority and urgency into including stuff

87
00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:42.360
thomasthiery: rather than for soon. Because if if it's

88
00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:56.980
thomasthiery: if it's the former, I would love to know. So we can maybe try to work on it. If it's the latter, then there's probably not enough work to do on the proposal or mechanism itself. It's it's just like a matter of preference and and urgency.

89
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:17.550
thomasthiery: Okay, so I I will take it as not.

90
00:19:18.170 --> 00:19:19.010
thomasthiery: Okay.

91
00:19:20.769 --> 00:19:32.910
thomasthiery: Yeah. If anyone has ideas about like things they think are wrong with the proposal, like, let me know there was some a bit of turbulence on Twitter today, because

92
00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:38.620
thomasthiery: the Max Resnick, who is now at Enza and Solana.

93
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:46.330
thomasthiery: He is a bit known to be like vocal on Twitter, but he was saying that it adds latency to the critical path.

94
00:19:47.214 --> 00:19:50.960
thomasthiery: Because of the view merge mechanism, I think like that's

95
00:19:51.320 --> 00:20:01.029
thomasthiery: I mean, the Id is partially right. And but the the time it's like the actual latency itself, like can be reduced down to less. For sure.

96
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:03.899
thomasthiery: if we, we think it's like

97
00:20:04.945 --> 00:20:15.834
thomasthiery: completely safe to reduce that latency between, like, basically the view freeze for the attesters and and and the proposal.

98
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:30.140
thomasthiery: but yeah, I think my thinking is like, let's start with like good safety mail margins, and then look at how it behaves on on testnet and mainnet, and maybe then reduce it down. I really don't think it's like it's like a

99
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.860
thomasthiery: truthful point that we

100
00:20:33.666 --> 00:20:41.189
thomasthiery: should take like at heart. But it's it's still interesting to to hear it and and think about

101
00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:46.360
thomasthiery: how and whether and when we can reduce that that latency.

102
00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:57.379
Jihoon: But is it correct to make an argument in that way? Because

103
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:05.330
Jihoon: inclusion leads is not the only way. I mean not the only channel to include transactions.

104
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:13.569
thomasthiery: Yeah, for sure. No, no, I I think it's it's not. I think it's 1 additional channel. So yeah, it doesn't.

105
00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:19.680
thomasthiery: You know, it doesn't reduce anything for transactions that don't go through that mechanism.

106
00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.690
thomasthiery: so yeah, that's a that's a good point.

107
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:43.870
thomasthiery: and yeah, I think it's really nice to also like look at the fossil and and shorter slot times. I'm also I also agree with Justin. I think it's safer to reduce slot times after fossil is included. Just because, like reducing, you know, slot time

108
00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:58.200
thomasthiery: can sort of sort of like shorten some deadlines. That we currently have in the protocol. So like, we sort of like reduce safety margins in a way. And

109
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:15.610
thomasthiery: yeah, I mean my my take. And I know it's not shared by everyone. But like I feel like it's it's nice to have, like a good slot structure we like before we shorten slot times rather than doing it the other way around but that's just my preference.

110
00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:25.780
thomasthiery: I I think I'm like open to do it myself. But like if everyone else like wants to do it. They're welcome to, but like sort of do you know, fossil

111
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:39.240
thomasthiery: and shorten shorter slot times compatibility post, just like I did with the Eps epbs and fossil might be useful. But the yeah, the overall point is like.

112
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:46.745
thomasthiery: no, it's not incompatible. And yeah,

113
00:22:48.260 --> 00:23:03.820
thomasthiery: I mean, at 1 point. It, you know, especially if we go to 6, basically like going to 6 is not incompatible with fossil. Like, if we go to yeah, 2 or 3. Then, of course, like, there is this sort of like view merge mechanism that like adds

114
00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:10.259
thomasthiery: some latency that can't be compressed down to 0. But yeah.

115
00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:28.960
thomasthiery: yeah. So when we talk about shorter slot times, are we talking about 6 seconds.

116
00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.549
Stefano De Angelis: Yeah, maybe even less than 6 seconds.

117
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.340
thomasthiery: Okay.

118
00:23:38.770 --> 00:23:39.799
Stefano De Angelis: Long run.

119
00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:47.340
thomasthiery: Right right? I mean, if you go down and down and down then yes, there will be some some like tension between fossil and like.

120
00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:55.329
thomasthiery: you know, one second slot time, I think, for sure. But then we need to re-architecture like the whole consensus mechanism anyways, like the whole.

121
00:23:55.620 --> 00:24:17.429
thomasthiery: That needs to be so much more of a restructuring than what we are thinking about right now, that it's even hard to exactly grasp how that will play out and fossil will be one of the things we have to rethink if we want to go to like one second time. But for 6 I don't. I actually don't. Don't think there is any incompatibility. There.

122
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:29.779
Stefano De Angelis: And so can we say that even if we go to 6, which is the most plausible approach, then we we can

123
00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:37.009
Stefano De Angelis: still have fossil working on Mainnet, and we don't have to restructure anything. In that case.

124
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:47.590
thomasthiery: Yeah, yeah, I think I can write the argument more like nicely. But yeah, I really don't think there is any tension with like 6 seconds of the time. And for so

125
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:58.609
thomasthiery: because I mean, il building and broadcasting is literally done in parallel at the same time as like block building.

126
00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.780
thomasthiery: So it it, yeah, it doesn't really conflict with anything else.

127
00:25:12.290 --> 00:25:12.960
Stefano De Angelis: Thanks.

128
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.069
thomasthiery: But yeah, I do have a feeling that this question will be asked

129
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:24.590
thomasthiery: a lot, and maybe we want to

130
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:31.980
thomasthiery: write something about it. So it's it's more clear. And we we can also, like, get our feedback and and opinions from from you guys.

131
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:39.579
Stefano De Angelis: Yeah, maybe it would be good to have some quantitative experiments.

132
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.540
thomasthiery: Yeah, yeah, for sure.

133
00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:45.449
thomasthiery: You mean, with, like

134
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:52.257
thomasthiery: the time it takes for stations to propagate, I mean, and like things like this, or like

135
00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:54.190
Stefano De Angelis: Yeah, yeah, that's it.

136
00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:13.929
thomasthiery: Okay, yeah, I mean for sure. And that's it's nice. Because this effort is anyways sort of like done because it needs to be done for shorter slot times in any case. So we can just take advantage of this and and see how well it it fits with with fossil. But I yeah again, I don't think it will conflict.

137
00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:22.520
Stefano De Angelis: Yeah, I think the the most important parameters for such an experimentation would be slot times

138
00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.740
Stefano De Angelis: and number of inclusion lists. And see where is the

139
00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:35.220
Stefano De Angelis: the maximum? Right? So where the the setting, the the optimal setting saturates after we reach that optimal.

140
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:41.089
thomasthiery: Right? Yeah. So one thing that's important to still keep in mind, I guess, is like that.

141
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:48.360
thomasthiery: Inclusion lists with by by definition always be much smaller than the block size.

142
00:26:50.530 --> 00:26:54.980
thomasthiery: So yeah, I I doubt they will ever be the bottleneck. Because.

143
00:26:55.230 --> 00:27:18.219
thomasthiery: yeah, the the there is also like a current thinking that we won't necessarily want or need to include, like increase the inclusionally size as we increase the gas limit for blocks that's not like that doesn't actually have to go together. So you can like. And and the the goal is like, you know, if we actually get to decouple local block building from

144
00:27:18.988 --> 00:27:30.709
thomasthiery: solo stakes. Then we could actually like sort of increase the delta between inclusion lists and the the throughput of the chain.

145
00:27:31.263 --> 00:27:33.849
thomasthiery: So like the gas limit for blocks. Basically,

146
00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:38.239
thomasthiery: yeah, and so yeah, just saying, like.

147
00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:56.020
thomasthiery: basically, I don't think we should necessarily scale the scale. The is as we scale the the block like the gas, and that then it will become even less of a bottleneck compared to like broadcasting full blocks.

148
00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:12.270
thomasthiery: Yeah, number of just sorry, Katya. Just number of includes matters and the size of the inclusion list matters a lot as well.

149
00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:22.549
thomasthiery: Now it's it's meant to basically have all inclusion lists. So the 16 be the size of the size of one blob

150
00:28:23.059 --> 00:28:28.009
thomasthiery: that was like sort of like the thinking around the size. But both do matter, and

151
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.606
thomasthiery: both can be changed.

152
00:28:31.410 --> 00:28:35.000
thomasthiery: even though we don't think like it's going to be a strain on the network right now.

153
00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.180
thomasthiery: Yeah, catch up.

154
00:28:39.149 --> 00:28:48.380
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, hello. So I'm currently working on the metrics we discussed in Berlin. Interrupt and probably will publish a draft

155
00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:56.270
Katya Riazantseva: today or tomorrow. So we will see the picture like the size of Els, the number of Els, and

156
00:28:56.400 --> 00:29:01.319
Katya Riazantseva: potentially it could help like to evaluate the 6 slot.

157
00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:10.310
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah. 6 second slot I hope it will help, so we will soon see it on both Star and maybe other teams will join.

158
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:20.944
thomasthiery: Yeah, that's that's awesome. That's like exactly what we need to start gathering metrics and start like making choices accordingly.

159
00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:22.320
thomasthiery: so it's.

160
00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:37.790
Katya Riazantseva: So so my plan is to add, the dashboard to quote for cortosis, so every client which has the same metrics will be able to use the dashboard. So yeah, maybe by by the next call, I hope. Yeah, we'll have some results.

161
00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:38.490
thomasthiery: Nice.

162
00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:38.810
thomasthiery: Thank you.

163
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.609
thomasthiery: Yeah, that would be really, really awesome. Thanks.

164
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:59.560
thomasthiery: Okay, does anyone have anything else to say? Sorry to? I actually have to to run. But it was, it was fun to discuss this.

165
00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.250
thomasthiery: and just before we maybe close

166
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:23.519
thomasthiery: off Botus is asking in the inclusion list chat if we went over

167
00:30:24.322 --> 00:30:31.860
thomasthiery: the doc about the epbs and fossil compatibility. So Jihoon gave a good overview. But

168
00:30:32.737 --> 00:30:41.542
thomasthiery: maybe next time I can actually go and present it a bit more if people are interested.

169
00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:52.590
thomasthiery: because I feel like maybe it's nicer if, like, I send it in advance and say, there will be a presentation. So everyone has time to just like, read it and and know about the the

170
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.839
thomasthiery: does that sound like an okay idea?

171
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:07.009
Jihoon: Yes, sounds awesome. So yeah. So we, you know, did this kind of

172
00:31:07.230 --> 00:31:10.900
Jihoon: research updates in our prior calls.

173
00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.969
Jihoon: And maybe it's good time to revisit the compatibility between the Pbs and possible.

174
00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:23.399
Jihoon: I have a question. Is that article fully reviewed?

175
00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:34.010
Jihoon: I have a question about some sentences, so I wonder if it's like fully reviewed by people who's working on

176
00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:36.320
Jihoon: both a Pbs and fossil.

177
00:31:37.742 --> 00:31:42.720
thomasthiery: So Terrence and Botus both had a look.

178
00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:53.819
thomasthiery: I mean, it doesn't mean like they, you know, looked extremely into the details of everything, and for me, same like there could be still mistake in there.

179
00:31:53.980 --> 00:32:05.509
thomasthiery: If you want to give feedback like, you can either just like post on on, if magicians, or reach out to me or or start discussions in this call like any.

180
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:18.149
thomasthiery: anyway, is fine. And if yeah, if you spotted some like things that were like inaccurate, or maybe that needed some more like some better wording just for sure. Let us know.

181
00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.740
Jihoon: Gotcha, I wanna you know

182
00:32:25.390 --> 00:32:31.169
Jihoon: dig deep into a eps and fossil. So let me reach out to you sometime

183
00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.699
Jihoon: in this week or next week. Thank you.

184
00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.699
thomasthiery: Yeah, that sounds great awesome.

185
00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:37.800
thomasthiery: Cool.

186
00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.980
thomasthiery: Alright, if that was all for everyone, maybe we can keep this one short.

187
00:32:48.770 --> 00:32:50.070
thomasthiery: What do you think.

188
00:32:50.640 --> 00:33:05.110
Jihoon: Yeah, we can just see each other 2 weeks later, and thanks everyone joining. And thanks Toma for staying with a call. So yeah, thank you. Everyone.

189
00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:06.670
thomasthiery: Thanks everyone, bye.

190
00:33:07.112 --> 00:33:08.440
Katya Riazantseva: You bye, everyone.
