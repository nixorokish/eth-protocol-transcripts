00:14:12	thomasthiery:	I can’t talk but curious to hear if people have opinions on FOCIL and GLamsterdam
00:15:02	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	For me S: ePBS as priority and A: FOCIL
00:15:12	Justin Traglia:	Personally, I want to see ePBS & FOCIL in glamsterdam. But ePBS would probably be the official headliner. Save 6 sec slots for another fork.
00:15:18	thomasthiery:	And especially if there are things people are concerned about around the proposal itself, or is it just a matter of priority
00:15:27	NC:	Replying to "For me S: ePBS as pr..."

Pretty much the same for Lodestar
00:15:47	Katya Riazantseva:	will vote for FOCIL in Glamsterdam
00:16:10	Katya Riazantseva:	the readiness is quite good imo
00:16:28	Marc:	Nethermind team supports including FOCIL but only alongside or after epbs
00:16:28	thomasthiery:	No no it’s not official
00:16:43	thomasthiery:	I think it’s meant not to be an actual formal voting mechanism
00:16:49	Katya Riazantseva:	Reacted to "Personally, I want t..." with 👍
00:17:47	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Forkcast is marketing - it's a communication tool only
00:17:49	Justin Traglia:	Yeah it has been a lot of fun 🙂
00:19:16	Katya Riazantseva:	2
00:19:22	Justin Traglia:	Reacted to "2" with 👍
00:20:27	Stefano De Angelis:	Main concerns are around bandwidth consumption and how FOCIL impacts slot times. Would it be safe to reduce slot times with FOCIL implemented?
00:20:47	Jihoon:	Reacted to "Main concerns are ar..." with 👍
00:21:15	Justin Florentine (Besu):	i think it is safer to reduce slot times AFTER focil is included, as opposed to prior
00:22:36	Jihoon:	Replying to "i think it is safer ..."

Could you elaborate on why?
00:23:05	Stefano De Angelis:	With shorter slot times, we might realize that FOCIL is not possible to achieve with the current design
00:23:22	Enrico Del Fante (tbenr):	Replying to "i think it is safer ..."

I think every changes on slot structure should be done BEFORE slot reduction
00:24:26	Jihoon:	Replying to "i think it is safer ..."

Ah right, so it's not just about FOCIL. I also think so
00:25:35	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "i think it is safer ..."

right, it the difference between compressing all the stuff you want to get done in a slot, vs. finding more time in the slot later to do more things.  one is easier to design than the other, assuming priorities don't change.
00:27:05	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "With shorter slot ti..."

this is fair. it is also a matter of priority - i personally think CR is more important than shorter slot times.
00:28:00	Stefano De Angelis:	What about the number of includers?
00:30:59	Marc:	presentation sounds good
00:31:08	Sebastian Lujan:	Sounds awesome!
