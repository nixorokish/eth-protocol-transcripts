00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.839
Jihoon: Maybe we can wait one more minute, and then just start?

2
00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:04.309
Jihoon: Alright, I can… I think we can just…

3
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.810
Jihoon: start this call. Alright, hello and welcome, everyone, to Fossil Breakout 20.

4
00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:17.999
Jihoon: Same as before, we can jump right into status updates and have some discussions, if any.

5
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.069
Jihoon: I guess.

6
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.610
Jihoon: We already have.

7
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:33.219
Jihoon: Everyone who are active on fossil development these days, but do we have any development metrics or testing updates?

8
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.230
Jihoon: Yes, Katya?

9
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:56.159
Katya: Hello, everyone. I updated the PR and added these new metrics implemented in Lodestar in this PR. Yeah, I left a couple of comments. I've seen your answer already to whom.

10
00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:13.799
Katya: So, yeah, I'm not sure. My question is, are we going to have some simulation of failing inclusion lists, or equilocating inclusion lists? For example, for peer does,

11
00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:26.309
Katya: prison team, made this… added the CLI flag, which… which caused kind of loss of columns, and so we could check a little bit.

12
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:34.760
Katya: This kind of thing, do… do you have something on your mind, something like this?

13
00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.480
Katya: Are we gonna check it?

14
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:42.260
Katya: Somehow, or just through the dead nuts and…

15
00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:46.050
Jihoon: Yeah, that's a good question. I think…

16
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:55.289
Jihoon: We can take our two prongs here. One is using some CLI flag, as you just mentioned, to produce some

17
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.179
Jihoon: Invalid or equivocating ancological leads.

18
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:14.839
Jihoon: And the second approach would be, setting up Author Tour to, you know, run some tests over invalid or duplicating culture lists.

19
00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.609
Katya: about 4 weeks ago.

20
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:33.970
Katya: Yeah, for the tests, the metric, the metrics won't work, so we won't, see the simulations on the dashboard, I guess so. So, with CLI common, that would be great, would be interesting.

21
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:38.379
Katya: At least to check the metrics, and yeah.

22
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:44.339
Jihoon: Yeah, I agree. Once we,

23
00:08:44.930 --> 00:09:00.050
Jihoon: decide to include fossil in Glamsterdam, we can add such flags so that we can test if every client is working as expected, and use your metrics dashboard to

24
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.310
Jihoon: See how it works.

25
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.660
Katya: So, currently.

26
00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:25.109
Katya: My latest run of Lodestar was yesterday, and I had some issues, but we're trying… we're discussing it with the Lodestar team, so maybe, yeah, I think they made some updates, and they need to check again today.

27
00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:31.029
Katya: That would be great, if we could have some interop,

28
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:38.419
Katya: I don't know, maybe you could try to implement these metrics as well on the prison side, or then…

29
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:47.869
Katya: We can launch some kind of interop, even through kurtosis, maybe some of these metrics that would be interesting to look into it.

30
00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:52.209
Katya: Whenever you have some time.

31
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.450
Jihoon: Yeah,

32
00:09:54.620 --> 00:10:02.820
Jihoon: Do you know what kind of work that most of people would do? Is it about rebasing, or just adding metrics?

33
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.189
Katya: The metrics are added, yeah, I think rebasing.

34
00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:10.140
Jihoon: Oh, great. Yeah.

35
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:12.060
Jihoon: Yeah, right.

36
00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.820
Jihoon: for Prism… Hmm.

37
00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:36.609
Katya: We have kind of… we have the set of metrics, we have the dashboard, so it's technically possible if some other clients will build the metrics, it's technically possible to check, to compare it to clients, for example.

38
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:41.440
Jihoon: Yes, for PRISM, I think…

39
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:47.429
Jihoon: it'll take some time to rebase it on the flow. Yesterday, I…

40
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:53.040
Jihoon: I had opened a PR that enable

41
00:10:53.260 --> 00:11:06.519
Jihoon: fossil genesis block to PRISM, and it was marched yesterday, so I think we can start working on replacing, on the PRISM side.

42
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:08.600
Jihoon: But…

43
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:25.360
Jihoon: the branch is a bit stale, so I think… not sure. I need to take a look into it to measure how much it would take. To be honest, I've been mostly working on something else, so I cannot promise, when that

44
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:30.750
Jihoon: when that I'm gonna start working on it. Yeah.

45
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:43.180
Katya: Okay, just let me know if this rebase happens. Just let me know, maybe I can take a look into it, how to add metrics.

46
00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:46.370
Katya: Yeah, just… Pin me somewhere.

47
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:53.459
Jihoon: Okay, great. Maybe you can try interop with Lighthouse?

48
00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:56.329
Jihoon: Not sure if Lighthouse is on Flow.

49
00:11:57.890 --> 00:12:01.069
Katya: I, I will, I will ask.

50
00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:02.900
Katya: In the channel.

51
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.040
Jihoon: Okay, great.

52
00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.919
Katya: as soon as I can run Loadar.

53
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.449
Jihoon: Yeah, sure, yeah, take your time.

54
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:17.950
Katya: Thank you.

55
00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:20.050
Jihoon: Thank you.

56
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.299
Jihoon: Do we have any other updates?

57
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:56.709
Jihoon: On my end, I've been mostly working on something else, and a little bit of spec tests.

58
00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:04.379
Jihoon: I do hope I can finish it by this week, and I've been saying this over and over again for the past few weeks, but I…

59
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:11.559
Jihoon: I'm gonna aim to finish it by this week, and open up a PR against Constance's spec repo.

60
00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.790
Jihoon: Yeah.

61
00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.500
Jihoon: Hi, Doma. Hi, Nancy. We were just sharing some status updates.

62
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.520
Jihoon: Yeah. Welcome.

63
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:43.190
Jihoon: Do we have any… Updates on red side.

64
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:57.319
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: On the rest side, it's been pretty much just cleaning up some of the code and doing the interop testing with, Geth, which has all been going well. If you want, I can talk on the…

65
00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.409
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Lighthouse, issues I was finding and working on real quick.

66
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.320
Jihoon: Yeah, please share it.

67
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.510
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, so… Lighthouse…

68
00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:28.710
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: was only passing zero inclusion lists even back for Electra, which I thought was kind of weird. So I looked more into it, and it seems like, the inclusion list that it's trying to get from the cache is… it's trying to get from, slot N instead of slot N minus 1.

69
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:35.109
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: And when it's trying to get the inclusion list, there's obviously no inclusion list, because…

70
00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:52.309
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: those inclusion lists for that slot haven't been sent out, so it's just grabbing one slot ahead. So I'm working on having it grabbed from one slot behind, and so far, it's been working in testing. So, still need to iron out a few things with that, but I'll probably open a PR for it.

71
00:14:54.610 --> 00:15:04.499
Jihoon: Great, great. And, if I remember it correctly, there's, another issue that some blocks are missing.

72
00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:09.940
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Oh yeah, when I just put my naive, implementation together.

73
00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:25.919
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I was running Geth and REST together, and both clients were sometimes failing blocks, or not proposing blocks. I know on the REST side, my logs were saying that it was an inclusion-less issue, so…

74
00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:36.659
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: one transaction didn't get included. I didn't quite check… I didn't quite figure out if it was the same issue on Geth, but I'm guessing it's probably the same. But still need to look into that.

75
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:49.870
Jihoon: Could you elaborate a little bit of how does the enclosure list transaction prevent some block from, being proposed?

76
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:56.040
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, on my end, just the inclusion list transaction didn't get included. Sorry.

77
00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:00.100
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: And that's why it was failing the new payload V5.

78
00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.920
Jihoon: Got it, got it. So… the CL is reorging out because it found

79
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:10.700
Jihoon: Some trans… English transactions are missing.

80
00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:11.840
Jihoon: For some reason.

81
00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:17.569
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, yeah, I haven't quite gotten to the bottom of it, but that's what I've seen so far.

82
00:16:18.430 --> 00:16:19.580
Jihoon: Got it, got it.

83
00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.910
Jihoon: Right.

84
00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:33.600
Jihoon: Alright, cool. So, it's really nice to see that we are having some… Debugging and progress on the…

85
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:39.480
Jihoon: On the first EL interrupt, there might be some bug in GAT, so…

86
00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.620
Jihoon: Just, yeah, feel free to just…

87
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:46.739
Jihoon: find the bug and open up a PR or report it somewhere.

88
00:16:47.090 --> 00:16:49.240
Jihoon: And, yeah, looking forward to it.

89
00:16:51.000 --> 00:17:05.319
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Sounds good. I'll let you know. And then, also, Lodestar, I don't know what's causing it, but there's also zero inclusion lists, and the logs of Lodestar say that it's successfully adding the inclusion list to the cache, so…

90
00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:10.000
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I don't know what's going on there. It could be a similar thing, but something to think about.

91
00:17:12.290 --> 00:17:16.490
Jihoon: Right. But you mean Lighthouse, right? That low star.

92
00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:30.279
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: No, Lodestar as well. I haven't looked into the Lodestar code, so it could be something else, but just saying it might be the same thing as Lighthouse. Not sure, though.

93
00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:36.940
Jihoon: Oh, I thought that Lowestar is not working today, but… Probably, I was wrong.

94
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:51.099
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I… it was… it wasn't working perfectly when I was checking on Fulu, but I was able… the build for a while, there were… there is another issue, but I was also getting a zero inclusion list.

95
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.269
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: It was a bit of a shaky testnet.

96
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:55.940
Jihoon: Got it, got it.

97
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.840
Jihoon: Hmm.

98
00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.660
nflaig: What value do you use for seconds per slot?

99
00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.040
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I was using 6.

100
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.020
nflaig: Yeah.

101
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:07.959
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Do I need to move that to 12 for…

102
00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:14.709
nflaig: Yeah, I think so, because we didn't move the code to the BPS yet, so to use basis points.

103
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:28.909
nflaig: So I think it uses absolute values, and then you get to the… yeah, it submits the wrong inclusion lists, because the freeze deadline or the submit deadline is 9 seconds, so it's outside of the slot.

104
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:31.960
nflaig: I think that might be an issue, yeah.

105
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.230
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, that sounds like it probably is that. I'll have to get that a look.

106
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.800
Jihoon: Yeah, remember that we had this issue…

107
00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:46.529
Jihoon: I don't know, like, many months ago. Right, yeah.

108
00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.029
Jihoon: Makes sense.

109
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:57.030
nflaig: Yeah, I don't think we have fixed anything in that regard, because the spec was just like that, and was just recently changed.

110
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:06.830
Jihoon: Yeah, you're right. So, I guess we can try interop between, Lostar Lighthouse, GED and Rev.

111
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.909
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, we can probably do that.

112
00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:23.680
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Especially once I get Lighthouse fixed up.

113
00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:33.659
Jihoon: Yeah, sounds great. With that, would it be enough for…

114
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:41.710
Jihoon: testing the metrics dashboard, Katya, if we have, like, at least two CL clients.

115
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:48.419
Jihoon: Even if we don't have metrics implemented in Lighthouse, it'll be implemented in Lowestar, so…

116
00:19:49.450 --> 00:20:00.529
Katya: then it doesn't make sense if the other client… I mean, for metrics interop, if the other client doesn't have… so it will be just…

117
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.150
Katya: door, and that's it, so I won't see anything.

118
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.380
Katya: on the Lighthouse, on the dashboard.

119
00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.159
Jihoon: Right, right.

120
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:16.000
Jihoon: Like, could you remind us what would be the…

121
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:22.090
Jihoon: Goals of this metrics, testing, like, how, how…

122
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:33.000
Jihoon: Like, let's say that we implemented the metrics correctly in all clients, then how do we tell if they are implemented correctly?

123
00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:46.760
Katya: I mean, first of all, we are just observing the values on the dashboard, and I mean, it's more for…

124
00:20:47.190 --> 00:21:04.429
Katya: The final goal is to observe this metric in the long-term period, so when we already have DevNets, so normally DevOps teams just observe if something's going wrong.

125
00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:10.960
Katya: During the long period of time, it's… it's… It's good to use dashboards.

126
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:18.710
Katya: And at the same time, we can… we can just compare, different values.

127
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:30.629
Katya: On different clients, so… Which also sometimes can be helpful for the clients itself, like…

128
00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:38.769
Katya: How long is, like, purification going, etc, so… and to find some issues, maybe?

129
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:46.549
Jihoon: Got it, got it. So… even if you just run a local dev net with Lowestar.

130
00:21:47.190 --> 00:22:04.649
Jihoon: then you can see the dashboard bit, but it doesn't tell you anything other than you just see the metrics measured in certain ways. So you want to use that dashboard to see if others say, clients are seeing the same thing in the expected ways.

131
00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:13.669
Katya: Yeah, that would be great, because this is the goal of the metric specs, so, the clients have, like, more or less,

132
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:19.590
Katya: Similar implementation in the important points, like.

133
00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:26.369
Katya: You wanna see, like, how verification goes, like, how many inclusion leads are produced, etc.

134
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:31.990
Katya: So, just a… Some kind of evaluation and observation.

135
00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.260
Jihoon: Got it, got it. Cool.

136
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:37.780
Jihoon: Right, thank you.

137
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:53.080
Katya: I would also like to collab with, EL team, maybe Reth, just to look into, what metrics could be added on the EL side.

138
00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.829
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, I'd love to work on that as well, so, just DM me on Discord.

139
00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.279
Katya: Okay, thanks.

140
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:17.650
Jihoon: Very nice. Do we have any other updates, or…

141
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:19.740
Jihoon: Something that we want to discuss?

142
00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:43.949
Jihoon: Otherwise, I think… We can go ahead and wrap up this call.

143
00:23:44.420 --> 00:23:46.950
Jihoon: I was thinking about…

144
00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:57.070
Jihoon: Yeah, I just wanted to ask, what do people think about changing falsehood breakout to monthly until

145
00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:10.400
Jihoon: We have client devs come back, because people are busy with Fusaka, and then we also need to wait until a PBS spec and implementation are finalized, so…

146
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.500
Jihoon: On one hand, we can just skip this one bi-weekly, so that we can

147
00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:19.509
Jihoon: Keep the momentum or something.

148
00:24:19.850 --> 00:24:27.200
Jihoon: On the other hand, I don't know, maybe we are… We could use…

149
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:32.829
Jihoon: Our time more efficiently by making this monthly?

150
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.780
Jihoon: I don't have a strong opinion, I just wanted to…

151
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.500
Jihoon: Ask what people here think about it.

152
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:49.169
Katya: My opinion, bi-weekly would be great, not to lose focus at all, like…

153
00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:55.889
Katya: One… once a month is kind of… Too rare.

154
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.840
Jihoon: Okay.

155
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:17.110
Jihoon: Oh, yeah.

156
00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.350
Jihoon: Yeah, I think for now we can just…

157
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:24.180
Jihoon: Keep it as is, maybe bi-weekly.

158
00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:28.129
Jihoon: Because monthly is too long, I think that's a valid point.

159
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:37.530
Jihoon: And… yeah, thank you, Thuma. There's a… there was a… there's a proposal to… use

160
00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:43.119
Jihoon: fossil in the context of native roll-ups. Luca…

161
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:50.530
Jihoon: Yeah, Ruka reached out to me, like, I don't know, a few months ago, and we…

162
00:25:50.720 --> 00:26:02.990
Jihoon: doubled in about how to implement this, in the native roll-ups, I mean, how to implement it using the… inheriting, the existing execution spec.

163
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.839
Jihoon: I think what's interesting…

164
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:13.679
Jihoon: to see this idea, maybe we can ask Luca to share his idea next breakout.

165
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.950
Jihoon: Yes, it's a… it's a nice summary.

166
00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:37.619
Jihoon: There was a tweet thread, that Luca shared. Let me pull that link real quick, and then we can wait for more discussion, and then wrap up this call.

167
00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.639
Jihoon: Yeah, here's the thread. Please take a look into it if you're interested.

168
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:03.090
Jihoon: And then… Yeah.

169
00:27:04.330 --> 00:27:09.699
Jihoon: Maybe we can have a look here to share a little bit more about it next breakout.

170
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.160
Jihoon: In two weeks.

171
00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:26.159
Jihoon: Does anyone have any more comments?

172
00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.519
Jihoon: Or… anything to discuss?

173
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:39.480
Katya: Last quick question, should we start from Elektra in ketosis, or maybe you can start from Fullo?

174
00:27:42.030 --> 00:27:45.640
Jihoon: I think they're starting… no.

175
00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.520
Katya: My latest config is, like, Electrod and Foolos, and…

176
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.889
Jihoon: Yeah, we are still on Electra, right? Pelly, do you start on Flu or Electra?

177
00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.160
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: For Lodestar, or…

178
00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:07.249
Jihoon: For Lostar and Lighthouse.

179
00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:17.269
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: For Lighthouse, I've been doing, Glow Ass and Electra, just testing both of those, and then Lodestar, I believe, is only up to Fulu right now.

180
00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:26.630
Jihoon: up to Flu, so you start, you start from Electra, and then transition into Flu, and then Gloas.

181
00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:32.150
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I… I think I was just starting from Fulu for Lodestar.

182
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:33.969
Jihoon: Got it.

183
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:37.920
Katya: Okay, we'll try. Thank you.

184
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:47.469
Jihoon: Does that mean the load star already repased on the flow?

185
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.669
nflaig: Yeah, we have the fork between claws and fool, so in between those two.

186
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:58.360
Jihoon: Oh, cool.

187
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:18.089
Jihoon: Alright, I think… We can go ahead and wrap up this call, and… We can get their…

188
00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:29.460
Jihoon: in two weeks, and share another update. And in the meantime, I will ask Luca if he can join us to share his idea on fossil

189
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.040
Jihoon: In negative roll-ups next time.

190
00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:41.790
Jihoon: Alright, guys?

191
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.340
Jihoon: Thank you for joining, and… See you in 2 weeks!

192
00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:49.270
Katya: Thank you, everyone. Bye.

193
00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:53.130
nflaig: Yep.
