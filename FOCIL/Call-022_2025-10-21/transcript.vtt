00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:18.389
Jihoon: I think we can wait just one… another minute, and then start the call.

2
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.319
Jihoon: Alright, I think, we can start this call.

3
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:33.270
Pooja Ranjan: VLI.

4
00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:42.860
Jihoon: Okay, thank you, Pooja. Hello, everyone! Welcome and thanks for joining Fawcett Breakout 22nd.

5
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:55.350
Jihoon: Today, I haven't prepared any research update, so we could share development updates, as always, and if anyone has anything to share, we can jump into it afterward.

6
00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:03.470
Jihoon: So, development updates, what do we have on client development, metrics, or testing?

7
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.630
Jihoon: Does anyone want to go first?

8
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.539
Jihoon: All right, and let me go first. So,

9
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:26.380
Jihoon: I've added unit tests for inclusion-laced store.

10
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.290
Jihoon: Along with a checklist for CL tests.

11
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.729
Jihoon: Here's a link, if anyone's interested.

12
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.929
Jihoon: Yeah, I drafted in a table, but Justin revamped it so we can read it easily.

13
00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:47.710
Jihoon: I'm gonna add more test cases and implement corresponding test.

14
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.279
Jihoon: In the meantime, if anyone come up with

15
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:55.719
Jihoon: Testing ideas that's not there, please feel free to open up a PR.

16
00:11:56.050 --> 00:12:02.529
Jihoon: I also fixed the gaff image, so we can have an… interrupt between Geth and Wrath.

17
00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:10.580
Jihoon: At least I thought I did, but it seems there's a bug, probably in GATT, and that's what I'm gonna work on next.

18
00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:20.990
Jihoon: Yes, Pella?

19
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:24.910
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I can go next, if that's all.

20
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:26.530
Jihoon: Yes, please.

21
00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:36.250
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Alright, so this week, I added… well, I cleaned up some of the metrics that me and Katya were working on last time, and we have…

22
00:12:36.430 --> 00:12:50.699
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: 3 more that we're adding right now, I believe. So that's almost finished, and then that'll be all for the EL metrics in Wrath. And then I've also been working on the execution tests, just drafting up the…

23
00:12:50.820 --> 00:13:04.329
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: the checklist for them, and started a little work on the actual coding for that, but, still, it's my first time doing tests for this. So, it's going along… it's going pretty well, but yeah.

24
00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:23.339
Jihoon: Sounds great. Do we have any updates on other clients, like maybe Teku or Lowestar?

25
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:33.850
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I can give an update for Teku. We didn't really make any, real progress.

26
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.390
Mehdi Aouadi: Since last time.

27
00:13:35.570 --> 00:13:42.120
Mehdi Aouadi: We kept the, the branch that we had, which is working on top of Folu.

28
00:13:42.330 --> 00:13:45.620
Mehdi Aouadi: You know,

29
00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:56.129
Mehdi Aouadi: I tried to rebase it on top of Glow As without TPBS, but it turned out to be a little bit hacky and hard to do, so I did… I chose to not lose the…

30
00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:06.070
Mehdi Aouadi: too much time on it. So for now, hopefully we will, have a… we will wait for the, for a stable version of EPBS, and maybe…

31
00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:10.860
Mehdi Aouadi: then we will, consider rebasing it on top of, GlowEyes.

32
00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:12.379
Mehdi Aouadi: Oh, yeah.

33
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:27.199
Jihoon: Yeah, sorry about the miscommunication. I think we want to remain on top of Flu, and then we don't wanna go for Glas without the PBS, because it will be too hacky, because.

34
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.890
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah.

35
00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.660
Jihoon: Yeah, so we… we can just stay on fluid, and then…

36
00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:38.539
Jihoon: probably in a few months, if we decide to include, I mean, SFI Fossil in Glamsterdam.

37
00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:46.470
Jihoon: Yeah, we can… still, we wanna… I think we wanna wait until the PBS spec and implementation.

38
00:14:46.640 --> 00:15:03.660
Jihoon: are gonna stabilize, and then, yeah, we can try to rebase it on top of it, and then there will be a little bit of spec changes, to rebase fossil on top of a PBS, but, I can take care of it. And, yeah, so for… for…

39
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.880
Jihoon: Now, for the time being, I think we can just…

40
00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:13.030
Jihoon: stay on top of Lou, and then try to make an interop between CL and Yale clients.

41
00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.490
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, sure.

42
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.770
Jihoon: So there's no update for Lostar,

43
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:31.220
Jihoon: Yeah, I guess that's it for client.

44
00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:32.620
Jihoon: development?

45
00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:38.020
Jihoon: Hmm, so Katya is not here,

46
00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.640
Jihoon: Maybe, Pella, do you have any updates on EL metrics?

47
00:15:46.560 --> 00:16:06.259
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, the only thing that's changed from last time is we're adding metrics into the block builder when we're applying the inclusion list to the block building process, but those metrics are pretty much the same as the metrics we were getting from the validation of a block in New Payload.

48
00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:16.310
Jihoon: Do you know what causes that discrepancy?

49
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.369
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: It's…

50
00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:27.630
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: It might actually be exactly the same, I might have misspoke, I don't have it pulled up right in front of me, but…

51
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.769
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah. Ju…

52
00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:40.350
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: We just wanted to track it differently, because it looks like it's tracked differently on consensus layer as well, just because it's two different calls.

53
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:51.030
Jihoon: Gotcha. So, alright, so… Last time Katya shared… said that we don't wanna…

54
00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:56.009
Jihoon: gathered two information, I mean, same information.

55
00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:00.650
Jihoon: in the CL and EL, and I guess…

56
00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:07.030
Jihoon: I may be wrong, but we want to somehow unify metrics across the CL and EL.

57
00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.859
Jihoon: Maybe it's already done.

58
00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:25.979
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: So, the metrics that we're getting on the EL are still different, because we're tracking how many of each transaction got included or unincluded, and then a label for why.

59
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:35.340
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Whereas the consensus layer is just a raw number of how many, transactions were passed, I believe.

60
00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:42.999
Jihoon: Gotcha. How many transactions we passed.

61
00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:47.760
Jihoon: I see.

62
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:55.309
Jihoon: Right, yeah. Thank you.

63
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:11.180
Jihoon: So that's for metrics, and I guess, yeah, I guess, Pella, you also want to share something about… I guess you already shared, but maybe you want to…

64
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:16.499
Jihoon: mention what you're working on on EL test checklist.

65
00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:37.650
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, I don't know if there's too much more to share about that, other than what I already mentioned, but, so far, I have, I believe it's 10 or 11 tests, that Jihoon's been leaving some comments on, and I've been working on getting those all fixed up and ready.

66
00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:57.919
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: just mostly basic stuff, like, ensuring that the size limit on the IL creation from the EL is correct, and then some basic transaction stuff, and making sure invalid transactions aren't included, and stuff like that.

67
00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.700
Jihoon: Sounds great.

68
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:10.270
Jihoon: So… Yeah, we were gonna have checklists for both CL and EL, and…

69
00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:14.760
Jihoon: Corresponding test will be following.

70
00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:22.610
Jihoon: Hmm, yeah, so I think that's for our development updates.

71
00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:28.379
Jihoon: Does anyone wanna… Does anyone have any comments, or…

72
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.610
Jihoon: Something to share.

73
00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:49.950
Jihoon: Yeah, otherwise we can go ahead and wrap up the call a bit early.

74
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:55.959
Jihoon: Alright guys, thanks for joining, and…

75
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.580
Jihoon: Hope you guys have a great rest of your day, and see you in two weeks.

76
00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.060
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you.

77
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:07.900
nflaig: Beautiful.
