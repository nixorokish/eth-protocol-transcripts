00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:23.779
Justin Florentine (Besu): What's up, cat herders? Good morning.

2
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.870
Pooja Ranjan: Very good morning, Justin. You always add a lot of energy in the call.

3
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.700
Justin Florentine (Besu): I just started my second cup of coffee, so, you know…

4
00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.799
Pooja Ranjan: Had early morning, I am on the first one yet.

5
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.620
Justin Florentine (Besu): Fuck.

6
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.960
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah.

7
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:14.860
Jihoon: Hello guys, I think we can wait a few more minutes until we have more people.

8
00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.820
Jihoon: Alright, 3 minutes in, I think.

9
00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:38.719
Jihoon: We can kick this off.

10
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.909
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are live.

11
00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.669
Jihoon: Okay, thank you.

12
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:56.949
Jihoon: All right, hello everyone, welcome to Fossil breakout number 25.

13
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.170
Jihoon: I've prepared 3 agenda today, 4…

14
00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.239
Jihoon: Yeah, hello, Stefan. The first one is…

15
00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.989
Jihoon: A fossil has CFI for HECA.

16
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:16.089
Jihoon: So, we can talk a little bit about it. And then, as always, we can move on to development updates.

17
00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:26.690
Jihoon: And then, as a last one, I haven't updated the GitHub issue yet, but I just wanted to ask, what do we think about, like.

18
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:36.610
Jihoon: when to have the next breakout call, because some people might have some vacation for next week. Yeah, that's the third and last agenda.

19
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:45.090
Jihoon: So… Yeah, let's jump into the first one. So, you know, as everyone knows.

20
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:50.610
Jihoon: Or you might know, Fossil has CFIs for HECA, and…

21
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:56.970
Jihoon: there will be the headliner process begins on January 8th.

22
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.019
Jihoon: It will last for a month, and then we will pick the headliner for HECA.

23
00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:12.030
Jihoon: Here's the… Ethereum Magician Post, if you want to learn more details.

24
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.520
Jihoon: Let me share it in the chat.

25
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:28.229
Jihoon: I know that it's not done yet, but I just want to say thank you, everyone, who has been researching and developing fossil

26
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:34.570
Jihoon: voicing out for fossil… Attending ACD calls, and also breakout.

27
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.119
Jihoon: Talking to many people in various channels.

28
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:47.729
Jihoon: Sometimes it goes contentious unexpectedly, whether you are pro or against Fossil sharing your constructive feedback.

29
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.710
Jihoon: Has been… and will be helpful.

30
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.219
Jihoon: We're not done yet, but we're doing a great job, I'mma say.

31
00:10:57.570 --> 00:11:04.729
Jihoon: We have 2 months more to go to SFI Fossil, and then many months to go to ship it, but we got this. Thank you.

32
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:11.859
Jihoon: Yep, so next up, development updates.

33
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:22.660
Jihoon: Maybe I can go first. I've rebased the EL spec, I mean, execution spec, from Osaka to Amsterdam.

34
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.279
Jihoon: Here's the link if anyone wants to take a look into it.

35
00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.809
Jihoon: And… yeah, that's pretty much it from my end. Does anyone have anything to share?

36
00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.289
Jihoon: Great, so Lowestar has rebased to the latest flu.

37
00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:09.610
Jihoon: Did you try interop between wrath and…

38
00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.550
Jihoon: Aragon, using this lowest star image.

39
00:12:20.250 --> 00:12:26.530
Faheel: I, I tried, before, Lodestar got rebased.

40
00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.950
Faheel: So, I'll, I'll try again with, after, after the rebates, yeah.

41
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:34.659
Jihoon: Did it… did it work?

42
00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.730
Faheel: Yeah, last time, like,

43
00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:55.600
Faheel: the issue was that, like, there was, like, some data availability, problems which it was running into, the, Lodestar node, but, after I disabled, like, the blobs, spamming it, it worked.

44
00:12:56.170 --> 00:13:02.349
Faheel: So… Yeah, I'll just check, recheck again, see if it's working with the new image.

45
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:09.750
Jihoon: Got it, it sounds like it should work, because blob is something that we don't touch in fossils, so…

46
00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:10.600
Faheel: Yeah.

47
00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:12.520
Faheel: And.

48
00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.339
Jihoon: Can you also share your Kurtosis config?

49
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.960
Faheel: Yeah, I'll… how do I share it? It's on…

50
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.050
Jihoon: I think you can just share it.

51
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:32.400
Jihoon: I mean, you can upload it to your… yeah, you can upload it to your GitHub, or if you just prefer to share

52
00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.719
Jihoon: script, just sharing in the, Discord channel.

53
00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:39.469
Faheel: Okay, okay, yeah, I'll link it, okay.

54
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:41.550
Matthew Keil: Yeah, that you could when you…

55
00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:49.760
Matthew Keil: When you get any error messages or any DA issues, do me a favor and just DM them. I'd love to see what you're running across.

56
00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:52.429
Faheel: Okay, yeah, thank you.

57
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.040
Jihoon: Do you have any other update? Yes, please?

58
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.739
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Not so much, Sean.

59
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:29.460
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Sorry. Not so much on REF, but I've been working on the sidecar to try to get some more data on sensor transactions. So, I have the…

60
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:35.049
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: like, the MVP for that working. I've just been using a free…

61
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:54.839
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: RPC APIs and stuff, just to test it, so I will eventually need… I'm trying to get my own node running right now, or I may need someone else's RPC node to do some real testing with it, but, I'm not sure if I'll have enough storage, but we'll see.

62
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:04.350
Jihoon: Do you have any article that lays out your research direction?

63
00:15:06.970 --> 00:15:19.259
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I don't… sorry. I don't have anything right now, but I could definitely work on something. Right now, it's just a real basic proof of concept, just trying to see if I can, what I can find.

64
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:20.630
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: But yeah.

65
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:42.699
Jihoon: Yeah, sounds great. I think it'll be really nice if you can, you know, make… write… write it down, then I can ask… I'm gonna review it myself, of course, but I'm gonna also ask other… other researchers to review it, so then we can elaborate it, I mean, improve it. So, yeah, if you are interested.

66
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:43.590
Jihoon: Definitely.

67
00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:45.219
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, sounds great.

68
00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.440
Jihoon: Great.

69
00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.890
Jihoon: Do we have more updates?

70
00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.729
Jihoon: Alright, it seems nuts, so I think we can move on.

71
00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:32.530
Jihoon: So… Last but not least, I just wanted to ask,

72
00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:39.350
Jihoon: Yeah, do we wanna cancel our next breakout call? Wait.

73
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.680
Jihoon: Let me read the chat.

74
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.239
Jihoon: Right, so… until January 5th?

75
00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:12.270
Jihoon: There will be no ACD call, except this… the one that we have this week.

76
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.420
Jihoon: So…

77
00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:28.550
Jihoon: Yes, next month is planned for… planned on the 30th of December.

78
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:32.219
Jihoon: Yes.

79
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.450
Jihoon: Alright, I think…

80
00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:50.989
Jihoon: we can cancel next one, which was scheduled on the 30th of December, which is also in line with our ACD schedule.

81
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.329
Jihoon: Just wanted to ask one more time if…

82
00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:58.949
Jihoon: People are preparing something to share in two weeks.

83
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:08.170
Jihoon: Otherwise, we can just cancel next one and see in… 4 weeks, which should be…

84
00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:12.420
Jihoon: on the 13th of January.

85
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.930
Jihoon: Yes, Katen?

86
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:26.770
Katya: Yeah, if we cancel this December 30, it means that we, won't meet before January 8th, alright? So…

87
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.510
Katya: Before this HECA process decision, or…

88
00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:43.080
Jihoon: Are you asking… So… I… do you have…

89
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.340
Katya: Yeah.

90
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:55.720
Katya: I always have concerns, like, do we need to meet before, before this HECA process, or not, or…

91
00:18:56.460 --> 00:19:00.419
Matthew Keil: Bite like heck, we're gonna go! Yay!

92
00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:14.229
Jihoon: Yeah, so, I think it should be fine, because it is just the beginning of the process, and the process will last for a month, and it is collecting

93
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.250
Jihoon: EIPs.

94
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:26.510
Jihoon: that people want to propose for the headliner for HECA, it is not the process that we select for the headliner, so I think it should be fine. But of course, like.

95
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:34.490
Jihoon: If you want to discuss something, or if you want to share something, you can always share it in the Discord, so that people can see it.

96
00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:40.120
Jihoon: Or, if you want to discuss something with me, I'm very reachable, so… yeah.

97
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.290
Jihoon: And…

98
00:19:44.030 --> 00:19:50.400
Jihoon: Yeah, so we had many a thumbs up for canceling next one, so I guess we can see on the…

99
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.599
Jihoon: 13th of January.

100
00:19:53.740 --> 00:20:03.200
Jihoon: And… yeah, there's… That's all that I've prepared for today. Does anyone have anything to share or discuss?

101
00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:20.909
Jihoon: Going once… Going twice… Alright, we can go ahead and wrap this up.

102
00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:27.819
Jihoon: Ollie, yeah, thank you everyone joining this call. I hope you guys have a great…

103
00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:32.270
Jihoon: End of year, and see you guys in 4 weeks!

104
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.400
Jihoon: Thank you.

105
00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.290
Katya: Bye, everyone.
