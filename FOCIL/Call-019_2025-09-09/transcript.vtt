00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.949
Jihoon: All right, I think we can wait a few more minutes to…

2
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:23.160
Jihoon: Have more people here, and then start a call.

3
00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.440
Jihoon: Alright, I think this is it. Hello everyone, welcome to Fossil Breakout 19.

4
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:43.469
Jihoon: We have a small set of people here.

5
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.279
Jihoon: Yeah, thank you, Pooja.

6
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.630
Jihoon: I guess people are probably busy with Fusaka, so we can keep this one short.

7
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.809
Jihoon: I don't have a special agenda other than development updates, so…

8
00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.350
Jihoon: We can jump into it first, and see if anything else comes up.

9
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:07.370
Jihoon: Firstly, I want to give a heads up about the spec. Currently, we cannot see the fossil spec on the website.

10
00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:19.719
Jihoon: I was told that feature specs were hidden because they are experiments, but shorter forks require some people to work on the next fork, so I asked Justin about this, and

11
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:24.279
Jihoon: I think feature specs would have a separate section from canonical ones.

12
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:29.770
Jihoon: As far as I know, Justin is on his vacation, so we can wait a little bit more.

13
00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:42.299
Jihoon: Next up would be rebasing. We are rebasing onto Fulu and then Coloss. Coloas is in no fork, like, without a PBS or whatnot.

14
00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:44.539
Jihoon: Hey, NC.

15
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.509
Jihoon: I know that not every client teams are here, but

16
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:56.629
Jihoon: So we are talking about rebasing, so does any client that want to share some updates?

17
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:15.809
Jihoon: Maybe not. I think people are still busy with Fusaka, so, I think we can…

18
00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.990
Jihoon: resume our work on Fossil after…

19
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:29.379
Jihoon: I don't know, shipping full circle or whatever, so that, so we can try out client interrupts again after we settle on

20
00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.419
Jihoon: I guess, clue us with the updated engine APIs.

21
00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:43.510
Jihoon: maybe we have the first EL interrupt. I haven't tried it out yet, but perhaps, Bella, you wanna share some updates?

22
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:47.470
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Sorry?

23
00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:56.190
Jihoon: I… guess you reached the EL interop between RET and GATH.

24
00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:07.389
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Oh yeah, I was just doing some basic testing on Electra, and everything seems to be working so far. I was only able to run it for a short amount of time yesterday.

25
00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:13.310
Jihoon: Great, you might want to double-check if

26
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:21.340
Jihoon: Red produce IELTS correctly. You can see the log, or click some slot in DORA to see the IELT tab.

27
00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.110
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Okay, I can take a double check at that.

28
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.270
Jihoon: Okay, thank you.

29
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:32.850
Jihoon: So, I guess we have… We already have 6 clients ready for interop.

30
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:36.719
Jihoon: That's that.

31
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:41.520
Jihoon: Do we have any update on the metrics, Katya?

32
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.080
Katya Riazantseva: Hello, everyone.

33
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:54.980
Katya Riazantseva: I've just added a couple of metrics more, but I think they are my articles, so I just build them.

34
00:14:55.180 --> 00:15:03.910
Katya Riazantseva: Probably next week, I will be more… I will have more free time, and maybe we will discuss.

35
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:15.309
Katya Riazantseva: the metrics, so I can open the APR in the metrics repo, if we have some agreements on metrics, if you don't mind, Jehoon.

36
00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.630
Jihoon: Yeah, of course, yeah, yeah, feel free to share it.

37
00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.439
Katya Riazantseva: And I wanted…

38
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:22.710
Jihoon: Yep.

39
00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:25.979
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, and I wanted to ask about the,

40
00:15:26.830 --> 00:15:32.750
Katya Riazantseva: the config, the current config, so we are, running…

41
00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:41.100
Katya Riazantseva: fossil on Fuller, on top of full, right? Or maybe glass already, or what's the current status?

42
00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:47.479
Jihoon: So, we… were based on Electra, but now that it's

43
00:15:48.000 --> 00:16:05.469
Jihoon: quite stale, so I think only Lighthouse and Geth are working at the moment. I repaired a new Cortosis config and Docker image that runs on top of Electra. It runs with only Lighthouse and Geth pair.

44
00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.150
Jihoon: So maybe you can try that out.

45
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:21.240
Katya Riazantseva: Because Lone Star is already rebased on Fulu, also, so yeah, I was trying to… Combine it with guest.

46
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:27.690
Katya Riazantseva: It didn't work properly, I don't know, maybe it's CL side, we'll check again.

47
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:35.479
Jihoon: Oh, okay, so I… okay, I… let me try that interop between low star and get on top of…

48
00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.869
Jihoon: It started with the fluid Genesis work, right?

49
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:48.740
Katya Riazantseva: No, no. I actually, I failed with Foologenesis. I'm starting from Electra, then follow, then go to Fossil.

50
00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:52.280
Jihoon: Correct. Can I already start from Pulu?

51
00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:54.310
Jihoon: So…

52
00:16:55.090 --> 00:17:03.600
Jihoon: Ethereum package supports Flu… and it also supports Coloss Genesis fork, so you should be able to run with Fluid Genesis.

53
00:17:04.099 --> 00:17:10.450
Jihoon: But yeah, I… yeah, I saw your, some error message in the, in the Discord channel, but…

54
00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.939
Jihoon: Yeah, I'm not sure what's the issue.

55
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:16.120
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, I will… I will give it a try again soon.

56
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:31.339
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I also tried Lodestar and Gep for the Fulu Fork, and Fulu was fine, and then as soon as, Fossil Fork started, everything went… not… it all stopped working.

57
00:17:31.689 --> 00:17:34.319
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I couldn't quite figure it out, either.

58
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:38.799
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, I've seen the reason, it's like,

59
00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:44.660
Katya Riazantseva: on the, I guess, on the Lodestar, so probably I will ask,

60
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:51.340
Katya Riazantseva: and C, because, NC is here. So, the reason was in the,

61
00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:55.699
Katya Riazantseva: engine API, I guess so,

62
00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:00.580
Katya Riazantseva: Update, how does call update payload, or…

63
00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.359
Katya Riazantseva: Notified payload, or something like this.

64
00:18:04.690 --> 00:18:08.329
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, this is where it failed last time I ran it.

65
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:23.589
Jihoon: Yeah, I can try that out. Maybe I have to update, some GAT code regarding the engine API version. Maybe, Nancy, do you have any clue regarding this?

66
00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:26.530
NC: No idea.

67
00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:33.639
NC: to be honest, like, the new code, I haven't ran it at all. It's not tested at all, so…

68
00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:34.979
NC: I don't know.

69
00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:42.220
Jihoon: Right, so there was no change on low star, so yeah, maybe it's natural for…

70
00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:48.220
Jihoon: Low start to fail after we transition into flu.

71
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:58.610
Katya Riazantseva: So, it happens right after transitioning to fossil, to EIP, like, from full to EIP. So,

72
00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.730
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, I will take a deep look into it.

73
00:19:01.870 --> 00:19:02.790
Katya Riazantseva: We'll see.

74
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.000
Jihoon: Okay, so, are you trying that…

75
00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:12.629
Jihoon: I mean, I retry EIP7805 after Fallout, because…

76
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:17.619
Jihoon: Because we are rebasing, right?

77
00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.070
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah.

78
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.790
Jihoon: Yeah, okay.

79
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.530
Jihoon: But I guess a low star is…

80
00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:33.330
Jihoon: they don't have any update on their rebasing yet, so maybe you can just start on Electra and then IP7 and 05, and see how your metrics work.

81
00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:39.570
Katya Riazantseva: No, we actually rebased, right? And see, we are on top of who currently is.

82
00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:42.759
Jihoon: Okay, so we were talking about rebasing, okay.

83
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:43.370
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah.

84
00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:49.919
Jihoon: Right, yeah, I can try that as well to see what's the log, and see…

85
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:52.400
Jihoon: Where the problem is.

86
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:56.789
Jihoon: And then I can share the, what I found.

87
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.590
Jihoon: In the Discord channel.

88
00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:00.280
Jihoon: Yep.

89
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:02.330
Jihoon: Cool.

90
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:13.450
Katya Riazantseva: And the latest, clients, images, so they are still in your repo, right? Updated?

91
00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.100
Jihoon: Right, so .

92
00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:17.889
Katya Riazantseva: the configs, etc.

93
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.739
Jihoon: Which… which image are you asking? I guess?

94
00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:24.980
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah.

95
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:25.970
Jihoon: Yeah, so I…

96
00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:30.539
Katya Riazantseva: I normally… I'm using your repo with all the configs of the clients, so…

97
00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.869
Jihoon: Yeah, so, we have two versions. The latest version is…

98
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:55.679
Jihoon: The latest one reflects the updated engine API, and the one before the latest one is previous one. So, I guess, if you are playing with Blowestar, then they haven't made any change yet, so you can just use the, the old one.

99
00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:00.210
Katya Riazantseva: Okay, I can try both.

100
00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:13.110
Jihoon: Let me pull that tag real quick, so that… Yeah, so you can try…

101
00:21:14.250 --> 00:21:15.830
Jihoon: Oh, there's the chat? Yes.

102
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:17.750
Jihoon: You can try this one.

103
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:19.060
Katya Riazantseva: Okay.

104
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:20.449
Jihoon: Yeah, this one should be good.

105
00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:22.350
Katya Riazantseva: Okay, thanks.

106
00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:31.190
Jihoon: Does anyone have anything to discuss?

107
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:43.400
Katya Riazantseva: So currently, people are working on EPBS, right?

108
00:21:43.620 --> 00:21:49.759
Katya Riazantseva: And, everyone's busy with PPS and Osaka at the same… at the same time.

109
00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.550
Jihoon: I… think so. I think people are usually…

110
00:21:55.930 --> 00:22:04.850
Jihoon: Most of the people are working on Fusaka, and some people are working on the PBS, on the CL side, at least, and some people

111
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.009
Jihoon: Find some time to work on next fork.

112
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.800
Jihoon: Like, 6-second slots, for example.

113
00:22:14.370 --> 00:22:15.400
Katya Riazantseva: Yeah, okay.

114
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:35.219
Jihoon: Yeah, we can… if anyone has anything to discuss, then we can, cover it. Otherwise, we can just…

115
00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:37.360
Jihoon: Get this one short.

116
00:22:54.300 --> 00:23:00.900
Jihoon: Right, guys, I think this is it. Thanks for joining the call. Hope you guys have a great rest of your day, and…

117
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:02.670
Jihoon: See you in 2 weeks!

118
00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:05.619
Katya Riazantseva: Thank you, Bargain.

119
00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:06.449
NC: I agree with us.

120
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:07.800
Jihoon: Bye-bye.
