thomasthiery: Hello!

2
00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.710
Akash | ECH: Hey? Am I audible? I guess. Yeah.

3
00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:43.070
Akash | ECH: Hello! Hello!

4
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.440
thomasthiery: How are you?

5
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.929
Akash | ECH: I'm fine. What about you?

6
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.988
thomasthiery: I'm good. I'm good. Thanks.

7
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:05.620
Akash | ECH: Okay. So today, I'm helping with the live streaming on both platform X as well as Youtube.

8
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.310
thomasthiery: Yeah. Yeah. Pooja also sent me a message. All good. Thanks a lot for being here.

9
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.719
Akash | ECH: Yeah, it's great.

10
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:10.990
thomasthiery: Hello! Hello!

11
00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:13.900
Mehdi Aouadi: Ion.

12
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:15.700
Jihoon: Hello!

13
00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:21.660
thomasthiery: I didn't announce this one very well, cause I thought it was gonna be a

14
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:31.910
thomasthiery: like quick, short ones. We might not be that many. But and that's let's wait for like one or 2 moments, and then maybe start.

15
00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:16.870
thomasthiery: Okay, let's start welcome to breakout fossil breakout number 13.

16
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.060
thomasthiery: Yeah, so, as I said, I mean, last week was interrupt.

17
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:28.040
thomasthiery: It was pretty crazy, and things are still happening in Berlin. So

18
00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:42.350
thomasthiery: I think this should be like sort of a nice and short and quick one, hopefully and we and there is no like presentation or or anything. I think we can just like discuss things that are like top of mind.

19
00:07:43.876 --> 00:07:45.689
thomasthiery: So yeah.

20
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:55.269
thomasthiery: what did I? I'm still like, sort of sort of like gathering stuff around for soul, and how it went during the interrupt. I think

21
00:07:55.600 --> 00:08:20.009
thomasthiery: maybe it's some overall comments or well, first, st I think, we had a nice fossil session people like really liked it. And it was sort of like a very packed overview of what's happening around fossil during 1 h. And I think the session was I don't know useful, and so that's cool.

22
00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:26.599
thomasthiery: Then, generally, like everyone I talked to was.

23
00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:49.400
thomasthiery: I don't know it. It really seems like there is like a overall general consensus on fossil being important. I don't know. You can see it across presentations. You can see it when you ask people what they think whether there are researchers or codes. I feel like everyone sort of like is on the same page, and and things fossil like

24
00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.830
thomasthiery: is gonna going to be like an important part of the future of the protocol.

25
00:08:55.545 --> 00:08:59.890
thomasthiery: The only thing that's left to determine is like

26
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:12.230
thomasthiery: the urgency. And that's a bit more viable, like people. Some people think it should be included as soon as possible like, and it's very urgent. Some other people

27
00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:30.479
thomasthiery: think it might be okay if it comes in the protocol a bit later. So that that's really like the sort of like contentious part. But I would say, on its importance, on, on whether it should be included. In the 1st place, is

28
00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:38.840
thomasthiery: looking really good. So that's very nice. I think couple of comments. I think

29
00:09:38.940 --> 00:10:03.319
thomasthiery: some people notice that. We actually might need a niel limit in gas and not just in kilobytes. And that's to make it work with the approvals in the future. Because if you don't limit per gas then, like, basically, you can include

30
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:14.560
thomasthiery: very worst case is for approvals to deal with via fossil, which isn't like something we want. So we need to think about

31
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:32.700
thomasthiery: I mean changing the il limit from Kilobytes to gas. I don't think that's a big, big overhaul. To be honest, I think we just need to settle on like a value. Basically, that's not too small. Hopefully, it still covers, like.

32
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:56.069
thomasthiery: like the all transactions that are usually included in in a block. Today, I think that would be ideal. That was definitely the case with, like the 8 kB limit. So we can see whether it's like 2, 3 million. Yes, I don't. I I'm wondering if you guys also have ideas about like the good size limiting gas that we

33
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:02.267
thomasthiery: should probably have but I'll keep giving it some some thoughts.

34
00:11:04.630 --> 00:11:28.289
thomasthiery: then good news. I think maybe I'll let Jihoon talk to talk about this, because he also has like insights. And he he was the one telling me a lot about this. So but yeah, both mostly like more clients interested in in implementing fossil, which is always like a very good news and a good sign. So yeah, I'll let maybe Jihoon talk a bit more about this.

35
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:32.474
thomasthiery: And then the one thing I really wanted to mention is,

36
00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:45.980
thomasthiery: yeah, that we need to focus on tests. I've noticed in a couple of conversations that people are even mentioning, you know, maybe

37
00:11:46.931 --> 00:12:00.170
thomasthiery: eips that are considered for Glamster, then, should have spec tests in included in, in their like devnet, or or or like implementation

38
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:12.890
thomasthiery: for it to be even considered for inclusion. So I think we might need more of an effort and tests like in the following weeks if possible. So I wanted to check with you guys on that

39
00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:40.038
thomasthiery: And unfortunately, Jacob was looking at the tests on the El side, and he's not gonna be able to continue work on working on this. So yeah, I think someone needs to step up. So I don't know if, like, anyone here is willing to do it it. Also, I mean, you can also like just DM, me, and and we can

40
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:57.379
thomasthiery: chat about it. If you are ever interested, it will be definitely in collaboration with the steel team. They said. They will be like willing to to help on that front. But yeah, basically on the sales side. I think Jihoon might

41
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.830
thomasthiery: refocus on on tests on this year. But we need someone on the year side. So if anyone is willing to help there. That, we really will.

42
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.210
thomasthiery: And yeah, that was pretty much it.

43
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:24.960
thomasthiery: Let me know if you have questions about the interrupt or how it went. Generally. But yeah, other than that, I think Johan wanted to talk about a couple of things.

44
00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:34.356
Jihoon: Yeah, thanks for sharing the update. Regarding the El Spec test. I can take it over.

45
00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:59.719
Jihoon: I'm planning to like, I expect I can finish the sales spec test in few weeks, like one or 2 weeks. My major bottleneck was filling up the holes in the spec test. I know. Sorry in the sales pack, and it's done so. I don't think it will take like much time, and I also met Guru from sales team yesterday, so I can take it up

46
00:14:00.555 --> 00:14:06.879
Jihoon: and another feedback that I want to share that we had during the interrupt is that

47
00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:20.840
Jihoon: we might need to shift the freezing deadlines, because over the time we expect to raise gas limit and raising gas limit will increase.

48
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.299
Jihoon: I'm sorry. Raising gas limit

49
00:14:23.802 --> 00:14:30.139
Jihoon: might make local builders run out of time. So we wanna like, for example, currently, we have

50
00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:45.620
Jihoon: 9 seconds deadline for our testers and 11 seconds deadline for builders. But we might wanna move it to like, let's say, 10 seconds instead of 11 seconds to give local builders more time to update their payload.

51
00:14:46.358 --> 00:14:53.490
Jihoon: That's also we wanna think about. And the second, yes, Toba.

52
00:14:53.780 --> 00:15:04.230
thomasthiery: Yeah. Just about your last comment. I think you're completely right. And it's a good good observation. I definitely think it should be included in this.

53
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:11.020
thomasthiery: Look at different deadlines

54
00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:36.890
thomasthiery: based on like the side of the the size of the block you would have to build for a local proposal, and you can always assume that like, I don't know. Sophisticated builder will be much faster anyways or so. So yeah, I think that's a good comment. But it could be included as a test. Just like as we try to actually, you know, increase the size of blocks that will be

55
00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:40.379
thomasthiery: built by a a local

56
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:47.240
thomasthiery: builder or proposal we can. We can just test this out and see whether the deadlines hold.

57
00:15:50.040 --> 00:16:12.590
Jihoon: You mean after we? Let's say, if we have both in Amsterdam we wanna decide to whether move the phrasing deadlines after we see how it goes in the real world? Or are you suggesting to run some tests at some at the public dev nest, and to figure out what would be the better phrasing deadlines before we ship possible.

58
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:22.489
thomasthiery: Yeah. The second one, I think, having an idea of about like whether the deadlines will hold under like

59
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:45.668
thomasthiery: blocks with higher gas limits would be nice to have before we ship fossil, so we can prepare for what's next, because we are pretty sure, like the gas limit is going to increase. Anyways, I don't think there is like a ton of uncertainty around this, so might as well just like test it before we even ship it. So we don't have to like change the deadlines of fossil

60
00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:53.149
thomasthiery: after like guesstimate increases, or at least it's not like a block blocker for for any scaling things.

61
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:59.520
Jihoon: Yes, totally so. To summarize it, we wanna

62
00:17:00.142 --> 00:17:04.309
Jihoon: have a good insights on 2 things. One is

63
00:17:05.112 --> 00:17:10.537
Jihoon: phrasing deadlines, and the second thing is what was it?

64
00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.297
Jihoon: Oh, Jesus, I forgot.

65
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:24.749
Jihoon: Could you help? I just forgot what the other thing we wanna test.

66
00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:26.020
thomasthiery: No, I think.

67
00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.250
Jihoon: Oh, right! Get get signed.

68
00:17:27.250 --> 00:17:28.770
thomasthiery: Like, based on block site.

69
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.222
Jihoon: Yeah, yeah, guess limit, right? So we wanna figure out those 2 things. Sorry.

70
00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:46.960
Jihoon: And then secondly, regarding the interrupt. So we thanks to ita here we onboarded a lighthouse. So we have 5 clients that work in the interrupt.

71
00:17:47.140 --> 00:18:14.609
Jihoon: and then maybe we can invite that their mind into the interrupt. Mark is also interested in working on that, so we might figure it figure that out in this week or next week, and also. Looking at epf cohort 6 I feel like 3 to 4 people interested in developing fossil and granting and nimbus. So

72
00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:22.279
Jihoon: after like few months. I expect to have like 9 out of 11 clients succeed in interrupt

73
00:18:23.006 --> 00:18:31.609
Jihoon: which is really cool. And then, yeah, I think that's pretty much it, for for my end.

74
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:52.580
thomasthiery: Nice. Yeah, that's really awesome, I think. Yeah, even talking to some of the interrupt. Some of the teams like didn't start implementing fossil. But we're feeling already quite strongly about wanting to cheer for it for for the next 4. So yeah, I think

75
00:18:52.730 --> 00:19:08.706
thomasthiery: you know, a lot of things are gonna be a bit more clear after the deadline for headliner is is passed, which is like in a month or something. So yeah, it's it's nice to involve more and more clients with.

76
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.420
thomasthiery: I I think we'll all have more clarity exactly on the timelines for

77
00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.450
thomasthiery: for everything in in not so long, which is nice.

78
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:24.860
thomasthiery: Okay. Does anyone else have something they want to share? Or

79
00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:31.309
thomasthiery: I don't know questions about the interrupt. It was pretty packed. It was very dense. But I thought it was nice.

80
00:19:33.649 --> 00:19:38.040
Mehdi Aouadi: I'd like to raise the question about rebasing

81
00:19:39.410 --> 00:19:47.009
Mehdi Aouadi: forces back onto full loop. I don't know what other team thinks about that.

82
00:19:47.400 --> 00:20:06.120
Mehdi Aouadi: because for example, in tech, we have all the furu boilerplate already merging, master, and unfortunately the fossil brand started diverging, and I was thinking maybe we could rebate the faucets back onto Furu.

83
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:14.020
thomasthiery: Yeah, that's a good question. How do you feel about

84
00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:25.400
thomasthiery: waiting for the headliner or Cfi sort of like decision before before, like rebasing everything on foulu like, or do you think

85
00:20:26.205 --> 00:20:30.119
thomasthiery: it's like quite urgent, and we should do it like sooner.

86
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:37.899
Mehdi Aouadi: I mean, the sooner we do it the better. But if we're talking like a month or 2, I mean we can leave with that.

87
00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.769
Mehdi Aouadi: But my thought

88
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:51.889
Mehdi Aouadi: we're like, I mean, even if we don't make it to Amsterdam, I guess we won't leave another fork without rebasing. So in the end. Maybe we will.

89
00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:56.629
Mehdi Aouadi: Sooner or later we will end up doing that. So that's what I was thinking.

90
00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:07.130
thomasthiery: Yeah, that totally makes sense. I think so from my perspective. But I mean, like, I think more people should chime in what? I'm

91
00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:20.610
thomasthiery: sort of sensing is a priority right now is trying to make the tests on both the cl and the year, because that could basically be a deciding factor of

92
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:24.550
thomasthiery: for the for sale inclusion in the next book. So

93
00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:32.560
thomasthiery: yeah, I think I would want to prioritize this overall like a rebasing efforts.

94
00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:32.920
Mehdi Aouadi: Okay.

95
00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:44.500
thomasthiery: Possible, like just for one month, but in one month we'll have like this decision of Cfi or not, and then based on. And then we should re base it in any case, like whether it's Cfi or not. But

96
00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.410
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah.

97
00:21:45.410 --> 00:21:50.210
thomasthiery: But you know, it would be. It would be like an effort that we will need to do anyways.

98
00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.979
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, sure, that sounds reasonable. Yeah, why not?

99
00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:54.710
thomasthiery: Okay, awesome.

100
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.269
thomasthiery: Does it sound good with everyone else?

101
00:21:59.137 --> 00:22:15.320
Jihoon: I think when we wanna consider repacing fossil onto follow. Another point that we wanna consider is that we wanna check like, if period is stabilized enough, because, as far as I remember, we avoided it.

102
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:41.739
Jihoon: repaising a fossil onto Pollu as pure depth was unstable back in the days I wasn't following a periodic development. So I'm not sure if it's stabilized enough. But if it's not stabilized enough yet that we wanna waste too much more because, like, it might be a hassle to, just, you know, making fossil work on top of like unstable, pure debt if it is unstable. So yeah.

103
00:22:43.070 --> 00:23:12.310
thomasthiery: Right? Yeah, that's a good point. So okay, so then let's say, for sure, let's not touch it for one month, and in one month. Let's reevaluate. And by that time I'll definitely try to find out if it's all stable, or if it's like changing a ton. I agree like, if it's just like minor changes, I think it's fine, and we can probably live with it, because in a case like it's actually diverging, and we will need to do it anyways. But yeah, that's definitely a good point. To think about when we

104
00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:22.430
thomasthiery: talk about it in a in a month. Great any other questions.

105
00:23:22.861 --> 00:23:33.149
thomasthiery: So yeah, with Jihoon. We sat down with Katya at some point and looked at the Cl. And El. Metrics for full soon, which I think was nice and would be very useful.

106
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:34.630
thomasthiery: And

107
00:23:36.202 --> 00:23:44.267
thomasthiery: yeah, there was also like a comment, by the account abstraction team. I'll probably just write it down before I talk about it. But

108
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:50.540
thomasthiery: yeah, you know, like as a builder, let's say, solo builder.

109
00:23:50.987 --> 00:24:02.760
thomasthiery: When you build a block, you have to like check. If transactions that were not included in the block are valid or not to determine whether you know the block satisfied the ir conditions or not.

110
00:24:03.030 --> 00:24:21.590
thomasthiery: And yeah, doing it that way, you know, can lead to some like worst cases in terms of computation time for local builders. Which you know, I don't think it's like the end of the world, but like should still be probably considered. And so

111
00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.739
thomasthiery: an idea would be to ask

112
00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:35.139
thomasthiery: the builder, whether it's like a local builder or an out of local builder to include a sort of like Il

113
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:40.848
thomasthiery: hint list to indicate where that the transaction.

114
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:52.409
thomasthiery: was executed in the block. Or like the attempt. The attempt of execution was in in the block. So

115
00:24:53.336 --> 00:24:57.629
thomasthiery: so yeah. So the the builder doesn't have to like sort of like.

116
00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.240
thomasthiery: try a lot of different combinations for for

117
00:25:02.420 --> 00:25:07.259
thomasthiery: for including like including il transactions in in its payload. In the 1st place.

118
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:24.990
thomasthiery: I think that's definitely something we will need in any case in the future. I've started to think quite a lot about like how fossil fits with Zkvms and statelessness. And I think this sort of Il hint or il sidecar thing will need to

119
00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:52.470
thomasthiery: like exist in the future, anyway. So we might as well. But yeah, that's just like the rough idea. I will try to write something. So people can also just like, look at the doc and see how it would affect fossil. And and we make a decision based on it. But it's not a big, big deal. It's just like a helper, basically to avoid like having to append. Il transactions to the end of the payload.

120
00:25:52.919 --> 00:25:58.869
thomasthiery: So yeah, just wanted to mention it here? But I will definitely write something about it.

121
00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.820
thomasthiery: Does anyone else have other questions?

122
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:30.600
thomasthiery: Okay? If not, we can probably wrap this up. It was a very short one, but that was expected. Given the the interrupt last week. And we'll go back to a more like normal, I think. Schedule

123
00:26:31.071 --> 00:26:37.749
thomasthiery: starting in in 2 weeks with like more presentations and sort of like, more content to to go on.

124
00:26:38.384 --> 00:26:46.295
thomasthiery: In the meantime. Exactly. In the meantime. Yeah, thanks all for for coming and

125
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.940
thomasthiery: and see you next time.

126
00:26:51.130 --> 00:26:52.309
Katya Riazantseva: Thank you. Bye.

127
00:26:52.870 --> 00:26:53.849
Mehdi Aouadi: Thank you, very.
