00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:21.229
Jihoon: Hello, everyone! I think we can wait.

2
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.550
Jihoon: Few more minutes, and then begin.

3
00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.260
Jihoon: Alright, 30 minutes in, I think we can kick this off.

4
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.500
Jihoon: Akash, are we alive?

5
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.800
Akash | ECH: We are left.

6
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.880
Jihoon: Cool, thank you.

7
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.250
Jihoon: Hello everyone, welcome to the…

8
00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:05.800
Jihoon: 23rd fossil breakout. This one will be the last one before the next ACDC, where we will decide fossil inclusion.

9
00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:14.599
Jihoon: So, I'd like to suggest to use this breakout to share our thoughts on fossil inflation after we share our development updates.

10
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.030
Jihoon: So, let's start with development updates.

11
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.589
Jihoon: Hello, Pooja. Does anyone want to go first?

12
00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.040
Jihoon: And maybe I can go first, as usual.

13
00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:50.210
Jihoon: So on my end, I'm working on the spec PR that rebases fossil onto Cloas. Tomai and I ask people about what do we think about fossil in Kalamsterdam.

14
00:11:50.330 --> 00:12:07.719
Jihoon: Some gave us the feedback that they want to see fossils back on top of glass. I opened the draft PR when you see a fossil, but it was stale, so I opened a new one a couple of days ago. It's being reviewed, so please have a look when you have some time.

15
00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.779
Jihoon: And… yep, that's all from my end.

16
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:23.349
Jihoon: Alright, so no updates from Lostar. Lostar's mainly working on EPBS, so it's great.

17
00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.660
Jihoon: Mmm… Yeah, anyone want to go next?

18
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.449
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I can go next.

19
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:53.550
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I've just been working on the spec testing and moved it over from, EST to ELS. All… it took a little bit, but I have 9 test cases passing, so I'm just working on cleaning that up so I can add it to the PR.

20
00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:05.830
Jihoon: Sounds great, that test case is running in red, right?

21
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:19.109
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, it's… I've only tested on… well, I'm running Wreath and Hive and testing the fixtures through that. I haven't tested on any other clients yet.

22
00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.009
Jihoon: Paul, sounds great. Thank you.

23
00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:34.890
Jihoon: Yep, so tech was all the same, nothing special, but still working on a PBS, sounds great.

24
00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:56.710
Jihoon: An APF fellow dropped a PR that implements Foso in Aragon. Do we have anyone from any Aragon, or anyone who's working on that PR?

25
00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.240
Jihoon: By any chance?

26
00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.810
Jihoon: Guess not. Okay.

27
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:15.889
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: I'm somewhat familiar, I can just talk about it for a second.

28
00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:17.830
Jihoon: Oh, yes, please.

29
00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:38.349
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, so that's been done by… I think it's Fahil, Fahil? It sounds like he just finished up his implementation, and I've been working with him to try to get some interop testing going on, so… not too sure about his implementation and everything, but…

30
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:41.439
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: It sounds like he should be joining interop testing soon.

31
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:55.610
Jihoon: Sounds great, sounds great. So… If it works out, then we were gonna have, 3 EL client interop.

32
00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:57.480
Jihoon: Which is great.

33
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:05.130
Jihoon: Yeah, I haven't fixed that,

34
00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:11.369
Jihoon: the… the bug in the GAT yet. I will be mostly working on the spec.

35
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.949
Jihoon: PR, and then I will be traveling around

36
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:23.569
Jihoon: DevConnect, so not sure when I can finish it, but, I think, if you guys are…

37
00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:31.719
Jihoon: continue working on that. I think you guys can try interop between Wrath and Aragon, and see if…

38
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.510
Jihoon: If it works.

39
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:38.990
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Yeah, sounds good.

40
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:47.309
Jihoon: Great, thank you. Do we have any updates on metrics end?

41
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.500
Jihoon: So, Katya is not here.

42
00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:53.880
Jihoon: Yes, Pele?

43
00:15:54.240 --> 00:16:07.330
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Katya went out for, I think, the last two weeks, and I had just heard back from her from today, so there's a few little tweaks we need to make, so… Not completely finished, but pretty close.

44
00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.360
Jihoon: You mean metrics implementation?

45
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:26.970
Pelle Krabbenhoeft: Both the list of EL metrics and the implementation ref. I think we just have, like, some naming conventions to deal with right now, but… yeah.

46
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:31.319
Jihoon: Oh, cool, okay. Yeah, thanks for sharing.

47
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:50.210
Jihoon: Alright, I think… That's that, unless…

48
00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:53.910
Jihoon: Anyone want to share their updates?

49
00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:55.330
Jihoon: Hmm.

50
00:16:58.970 --> 00:16:59.760
Jihoon: Share.

51
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:06.739
Jihoon: Alright, it seems that's that for our development updates.

52
00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:26.110
Jihoon: Right, cool. Now, let's move on and share our thoughts on fossil in Kalamsterdam. We are in fossil breakout, but it really doesn't mean that you have to be pro-fossil, or we don't have to derive any conclusion either. We could use this time to do some

53
00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:33.789
Jihoon: temperature check before ACD calls, so… Who wanna go first?

54
00:17:47.170 --> 00:17:51.410
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I can go first for… for tech team.

55
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:58.750
Mehdi Aouadi: So basically, we are, we, we think, we still think the same, since we've,

56
00:17:59.130 --> 00:18:08.250
Mehdi Aouadi: gave our feedback for the Glamsterdam headliners. We definitely think that Fossil, is the next EIP that should be SFI'd.

57
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:16.179
Mehdi Aouadi: So, we are a little bit concerned for EPBS and the added complexity that it will introduce, so…

58
00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:24.950
Mehdi Aouadi: I think once we have at least a first EPBS working DevNet, we can definitely

59
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:33.010
Mehdi Aouadi: voice for, for, for, for merging the, the, the faster spec PR into, the constant spec, so…

60
00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:36.119
Mehdi Aouadi: That's the only thing that we are,

61
00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:54.889
Mehdi Aouadi: a little bit, concerned about, basically, how it would, be with the EPBS. So, yeah, but for now, we did some good progress in EPBS. We still not have, a, a working implementation, but hopefully,

62
00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:02.350
Mehdi Aouadi: As soon as we have one, we definitely, we definitely want to, to,

63
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:09.089
Mehdi Aouadi: fossil to be acidified. So, yeah, that's… and now we will share our thoughts on that.

64
00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.029
Mehdi Aouadi: Before the next, ACDC, I guess.

65
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:22.070
soispoke: Hi, just so I understand, do you…

66
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:34.889
soispoke: Do you feel like it will… will you be even more comfortable, like, delaying the decision, or do you think it's just, like, fine to have a decision, this week, and…

67
00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:40.619
soispoke: Like, because it seems like you… yeah, I'm not sure exactly what you have.

68
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:58.089
Mehdi Aouadi: In my understanding, we need to… I mean, the CL teams are asked to give a feedback on the next, consensus score, right? Yeah. Just to be sure, yeah. So, yeah, our feedback… and… yeah, our feedback is definitely that we can include, fossil.

69
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:02.990
Mehdi Aouadi: Should we voice that…

70
00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:14.110
Mehdi Aouadi: in my understanding, do we need, like, to say if we want it to be SFI'd, during that call, or should we just give a feedback on…

71
00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.599
soispoke: Yeah, I think the idea is to…

72
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:22.800
soispoke: to make choices about EAPs.

73
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.920
soispoke: client teams think should be SFI'd.

74
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:38.049
soispoke: So… Yeah, I mean, from my… what I understood, like.

75
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:46.389
soispoke: Clients are, like, asked for, like, a sort of, like, decision on what EIPs they would want to specify.

76
00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:55.329
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, then our decision would be definitely, we could decide,

77
00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:03.650
Mehdi Aouadi: with the condition that we… I mean, EPBS should… should… is the headliner and should be the… the…

78
00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:18.510
Mehdi Aouadi: the most important EIP, like, to implement, if it really makes things hard and, could delay PBS, maybe…

79
00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:26.250
Mehdi Aouadi: We should reconsider that, but… For now, we think that it's… it's doable, and…

80
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:30.349
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I think… I think we would be okay to SFI it.

81
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:40.609
soispoke: Okay, yeah, that's… that's clear, thanks. Maybe one thing that's not only for… for you, but, like, generally, like.

82
00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:46.779
soispoke: I feel like… the notion of delaying EPBS with forceful.

83
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.710
soispoke: I mean, it will introduce some delays, I think, so…

84
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:58.170
soispoke: I feel like… I don't know if it's fair to say

85
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:11.880
soispoke: Yeah, I don't know. I'm just struggling with the idea of, like, for example, saying, we want to SFI fossil, but as long as it doesn't introduce delays.

86
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:22.510
soispoke: Just because of the fact that it's, you know, additional code and logic that needs to be, shipped. So I think it should be framed as, like, how…

87
00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:29.090
soispoke: How long, you know, how much of a delay are we ready to…

88
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:47.560
soispoke: to accept for it to be SFI'd, or… or… and then after that delay, it should be dropped, so it doesn't, like, you know, actually delay PBS and, like, headliners, generally, like, further than this. But just… just suggest… suggesting, like, it might be worth

89
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:51.179
soispoke: thinking along these terms as well.

90
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.489
soispoke: But, yeah, just wanted to know what people thought.

91
00:23:20.010 --> 00:23:30.020
soispoke: And see, can you remind me what was Lodestar exactly saying? Because I'm trying to find the docs, but .

92
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:37.039
NC: Yeah, it was a blog post, yeah, basically supporting EPUS and Foso together.

93
00:23:37.930 --> 00:23:47.970
NC: But also, you know, since, like, last ACDC, there have been, you know, a lot of new EIP candidates, so we still need to go through them.

94
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:52.290
NC: And see if, like, our opinion has changed.

95
00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.160
soispoke: That makes sense. Cool. Thanks.

96
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:16.549
Jihoon: Great, great. Do we have any other comments?

97
00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:27.590
Jihoon: If you want to express your personal opinion, that's also… very welcomed, so, shit.

98
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.460
Jihoon: So Nethermine's also pro-fossil for Klamsterdam.

99
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:38.479
Jihoon: Though it's hard to say what the trade-off is.

100
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.569
Jihoon: with a delayed BDS.

101
00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:44.700
Jihoon: So it seems we have

102
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:51.109
Jihoon: more devs here from several teams. Maybe we can ask

103
00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:59.450
Jihoon: Maybe it's not a good question, but maybe we can ask, how much delay do we think acceptable?

104
00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:08.360
Jihoon: like, in… when we… if I did, the estimation was… Like, 2 months.

105
00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:18.740
Jihoon: then, let's say we're gonna delay PBS for 2 months, I mean, Amsterdam. Then, do we think that's… okay.

106
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.830
Jihoon: like… Yeah.

107
00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:25.600
Jihoon: Can we get some frame that…

108
00:25:26.210 --> 00:25:32.030
Jihoon: Fossil is fine, as long as it doesn't delay up to… X month.

109
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.820
Jihoon: Or do we even need that?

110
00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.870
Jihoon: So, 3 months would be the delay.

111
00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:17.130
Jihoon: And… Hmm.

112
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:30.980
soispoke: Yeah. Well, I can give a personal opinion, I guess. Obviously a bit biased, but

113
00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.640
soispoke: No, we've had actually quite a lot of discussions

114
00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.859
soispoke: around this, internally, I guess, DEF.

115
00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:42.259
soispoke: And I would say opinions are split.

116
00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:51.219
soispoke: And yeah, as I already said, I guess, like, on ACD or whatever, but there are some…

117
00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:58.349
soispoke: Researchers and devs at the end that Just, like, really want to…

118
00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:03.010
soispoke: Ship on a, like, very regular, strict cadence.

119
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:14.479
soispoke: And others that think it's fine, delaying a fork by a bit, if it's to include, like, an important feature.

120
00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:23.150
soispoke: I sit, like, in the second camp, I guess, but it's not, like, a very popular opinion, I guess. And…

121
00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:28.080
soispoke: Yeah,

122
00:27:29.290 --> 00:27:41.720
soispoke: my worry is that… and so, yeah, I have to say that I guess the more consensual, like, more broad… broader, like, opinion at DF is to ship fossil for the H…

123
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.190
soispoke: start fork.

124
00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:53.670
soispoke: But I do think there's just, like, a lot of uncertainty when talking about, like, future forks. I think we've seen that in the past.

125
00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:55.230
soispoke: And…

126
00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:11.290
soispoke: yeah, I always basically think it's completely fine, you know, if we come to the edge fork, and for some technical reasons, full soul is not a priority anymore, and then it's delayed again, or whatever, like, that's all good, because,

127
00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:19.539
soispoke: Because it's a technical reason, like, it means priorities have shifted, and core devs, and, like, the community, like, thinks it's not as important anymore.

128
00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:25.390
soispoke: But, yeah, as I said last time, I think they're all…

129
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:33.009
soispoke: non-technical reasons that could also affect, an IP, like, like, Fossil.

130
00:28:33.270 --> 00:28:39.600
soispoke: And… that's why my position is… basically strongly…

131
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:45.430
soispoke: Programs for them, just because…

132
00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:56.590
soispoke: I want to de-risk it. And it's a hard sell, because Fossil is a very, like, defensive sort of, like, EIP, like, it won't really drastically…

133
00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.639
soispoke: change UX, for example, for users.

134
00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:04.490
soispoke: Compared to, I don't know, scaling AIPs, for example.

135
00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:08.939
soispoke: But, yeah, I want to de-risk it, so we don't…

136
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:13.950
soispoke: End up, like, having the exact same discussion for…

137
00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:17.069
soispoke: For future folks, and maybe,

138
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:21.370
soispoke: Getting into a point where it's just, like, harder.

139
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:23.140
soispoke: from, like, a… I don't know.

140
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:33.509
soispoke: political environment perspective, let's say, to ship it, which would be a shame, because then it wouldn't be for technical reasons.

141
00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:46.539
soispoke: But, yeah, I've said this already,

142
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:52.910
soispoke: Does anyone here, like, have, like, Other arguments, because,

143
00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:57.700
soispoke: I feel like, we could also, like, go back to maybe, like, some technical…

144
00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:07.699
soispoke: decisions. One thing I said that was, yeah, I think interesting is, like, what do you guys… would you guys agree that,

145
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:13.540
soispoke: like, repricing EIPs should be implemented by the EL folks after.

146
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.250
soispoke: sort of, like, EPBS and bells are, like, stabilized, which would give us maybe some time

147
00:30:19.410 --> 00:30:21.969
soispoke: To ship fossil.

148
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.980
soispoke: Or is that just not the right way to think about this?

149
00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:32.319
soispoke: Do you have an idea, Jihoon? Like, or anyone else, yeah?

150
00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:39.620
Jihoon: I was thinking about, like.

151
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.830
Jihoon: do I have any good answer regarding…

152
00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:47.460
Jihoon: the question of repricing EIP, and…

153
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:59.419
Jihoon: that was the moment Justin came in, because I asked him about, like, what do we want to prioritize when it comes to repricing versus fossil.

154
00:31:59.690 --> 00:32:02.940
Jihoon: Yeah, I…

155
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:12.369
Jihoon: Honestly, I don't have a good answer to that question, but if I were to share my thoughts on fossil in Kalamsterdam.

156
00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:18.800
Jihoon: Of course, Yeah, like.

157
00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:24.269
Jihoon: I mean, it's cold, so I wanna see Fossil in Amsterdam, because…

158
00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:30.379
Jihoon: The community has been signaled strong preferences for fossil inclusion.

159
00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.439
Jihoon: And I think the main argument against Fossil is that

160
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:39.709
Jihoon: It was gonna delay the fork, which is true.

161
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:41.820
Jihoon: But…

162
00:32:42.220 --> 00:33:00.109
Jihoon: I believe majority of people agree that we want fossil, so let's have it in HECA, but I think the same argument would be applied in HECA as well. It touches both layers, it's not crystal clear which of the three goals it belongs to.

163
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:07.169
Jihoon: The interaction with the headliner, whatever that be, is unknown, so we should have it in… let's say, iFork.

164
00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:12.669
Jihoon: But the thing is, the later we want to have it, the more difficult it'll become.

165
00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:20.810
Jihoon: And I'm in a camp that I believe we all want to add more value to Ethereum.

166
00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.819
Jihoon: And, yeah, basically, I just think that having fossilink in Amsterdam is a way to achieve it.

167
00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:31.229
Jihoon: But we also need to consider other EIPs.

168
00:33:31.510 --> 00:33:36.180
Jihoon: Such as repricing, and when it comes to that question.

169
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:41.209
Jihoon: I'll defer others to, you know, share our good opinions on it.

170
00:33:41.610 --> 00:33:50.030
Jihoon: So, yeah, maybe… I don't know, maybe ELDef here could provide us… some… insights?

171
00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:59.740
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, I'm Justin from the Basi team, Yale Dev, right? And I think that…

172
00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:05.899
Justin Florentine (Besu): The comparison between fossil and gas repricings, I don't find…

173
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:13.550
Justin Florentine (Besu): I don't find them very comparable, meaning that… They provide wildly different things.

174
00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:18.540
Justin Florentine (Besu): And they are difficult in very different ways.

175
00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:31.259
Justin Florentine (Besu): Meaning that fossil is difficult because it has to be done on both the EL and the CL. It has some interactions with EPBS. EPBS makes it,

176
00:34:31.510 --> 00:34:50.290
Justin Florentine (Besu): a little bit easier, right? Gas repricings, on the other hand, can be shipped in a lot of different ways. There's a ton of different EIPs, there's tons of different ways that you can bundle them together, and they're difficult because of a scheduling and testing.

177
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:51.650
Justin Florentine (Besu): burden.

178
00:34:51.920 --> 00:35:01.760
Justin Florentine (Besu): They're difficult to schedule because they can be grouped in different ways, and those groups interact with each other in hard-to-reason-about manners.

179
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:22.409
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, for instance, we're supposed to, on Thursday, have a list of EIPs that are ready to go, or that, you know, your team thinks should be included in Glamsterdam. And, you know, my team doesn't have that yet, and if we did put a list together, it would be very low quality, because it's hard for us to reason about all these different categories of gas repricing and how they might interact.

180
00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:37.230
Justin Florentine (Besu): That's going to directly translate into a testing burden when we try to ship the hard fork. So, you know, I don't find… I don't find the argument that, you know, there's no room for fossil because we have to do gas repricing

181
00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:55.209
Justin Florentine (Besu): very compelling. And if I had to make my decision today, I would prioritize fossil over gas repricing, because I don't really see, you know, yeah, maybe the gas pricing today is suboptimal, but I don't know, it's been okay for a long time.

182
00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.240
Justin Florentine (Besu): So, you know, that's kind of my perspective. I think that…

183
00:35:59.670 --> 00:36:17.579
Justin Florentine (Besu): the only arguments that I've heard for gas repricing are that, well, this is a scaling hard fork, and it's thematically consistent. I don't find that compelling. We can do, you know, multiple things, at one time in one hard fork.

184
00:36:17.770 --> 00:36:27.249
Justin Florentine (Besu): And I think scaling has had plenty of developer attention over the last, you know, 3 years or so. So, end rant.

185
00:36:27.510 --> 00:36:29.820
Justin Florentine (Besu): Thank you for coming to my TED Talk.

186
00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:41.830
soispoke: Thanks. I think that was interesting, thanks for sharing that. Would you… okay, one thing I needed, like, maybe some clarification on is, like.

187
00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.510
soispoke: is it true that we, like, EPBS and BALS,

188
00:36:46.590 --> 00:37:04.319
soispoke: like, need to be in their, let's say, final form, and sort of, like, not shipped on mainnet, but, you know, like, actually stable, before we can even consider doing the testing for repricing EIPs, because

189
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:09.780
soispoke: you know, you shift the… with the PBS, at least, you, you do…

190
00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:17.300
soispoke: change the slot structure and the time allocated to execution, propagation and everything, so if you really want to fully

191
00:37:17.540 --> 00:37:28.150
soispoke: sort of, like, optimize repricings for EPBS. For example, it feels natural that you'll set EPBS first, and then do repricings. Is that the way to think about it, or…

192
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:48.420
Justin Florentine (Besu): I don't really… I find those to be pretty orthogonal. I'll defer to POTUS on that, but I really don't really see any interrelation to them. I think wanting to do gas repricings after EPBS involves is just a way of saying, I want to do gas repricings as soon as possible. I really don't see any interaction there.

193
00:37:50.410 --> 00:37:51.250
soispoke: Interesting.

194
00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:00.600
Marc: I think in terms of block access lists and repricing, there could be quite a bit of interaction there.

195
00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.729
Marc: Especially, like, around the testing effort, like, I think…

196
00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:18.539
Marc: there's a lot of, very, kind of, specific EVM edge cases and block access lists that, kind of, also depend on gas pricing, so I can see that certainly from… in terms of testing, like, that'll be a bit complicated there.

197
00:38:22.340 --> 00:38:30.110
Justin Florentine (Besu): But you don't… you don't imagine being able to paralyze a block getting expressed in gas pricing, do you?

198
00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:38.389
Marc: No, this is just talking about the sort of block access list construction part, so kind of separate from the…

199
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.380
Marc: Parallel execution, just like…

200
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:54.770
Marc: Basically creating the list of all the, you know, state, reads, access, etc, and testing that is kind of very interlinked with the gas pricing schedule.

201
00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.810
Justin Florentine (Besu): Hmm.

202
00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.040
Justin Florentine (Besu): Okay.

203
00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:04.960
Justin Florentine (Besu): I find that… not obvious, but I'll consider that.

204
00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.639
Marc: Like, I'm not saying it's insurmountable or anything, I just think that, like.

205
00:39:11.050 --> 00:39:18.940
Marc: There's gonna be a… for bowels and repricing, there's gonna be, like, a big testing effort, and there could be some kind of complexities that are… that overlap.

206
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:36.619
Marc: Yeah, I mean, personally, I don't see that as a…

207
00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.739
Marc: problem for Fossil. I mean.

208
00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.460
Marc: like, personally, I see it as quite a high-priority thing, so I don't…

209
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:51.970
Marc: mind if it delays the fork by a few months, but, we haven't really discussed this as a team yet, so I can't really speak as to what other people think.

210
00:39:56.170 --> 00:39:59.190
soispoke: Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, thanks for sharing.

211
00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:07.429
soispoke: I mean, okay, there is an alternative world in which, Possol… yes, it is cross-layered, but, like, it's still, like.

212
00:40:08.170 --> 00:40:12.570
soispoke: Mostly lives on the, on the CL, by far.

213
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.020
soispoke: So…

214
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:23.440
soispoke: I mean, yeah, if you, you know, if people end up wanting to include, like, a lot of, gas repricing ZIP, and those will actually take time.

215
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:28.879
soispoke: And fossil mostly lives on the CL, maybe that's also an argument, too.

216
00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.540
soispoke: Parallelized efforts between both. But,

217
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:40.989
soispoke: Yeah, because I do think for sale is quite minimal on the EL side of things.

218
00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:49.739
Jihoon: It's just a dumb question, is there a…

219
00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:56.859
Jihoon: Will there be an edit complexity coming from, overlapped.

220
00:40:57.210 --> 00:41:01.479
Jihoon: Testing surface between Bells and fossil.

221
00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:20.010
Marc: I mean, personally, I wouldn't think too much between bowels and fossil, because, yeah, I mean, fossil's mostly CL, right? And…

222
00:41:20.570 --> 00:41:27.440
Marc: from… just off the top of my head, like, I think the kind of code changes don't touch most of the same stuff.

223
00:41:30.390 --> 00:41:32.239
Jihoon: Good. Thank you. Potas, please.

224
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.090
potuz: Yeah, so…

225
00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:44.509
potuz: I have a bunch of, like, random comments, mostly personal opinion. I, myself, want to see Fossil in Protocol. I think it's…

226
00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:54.670
potuz: it's the property that blockchains provide, and we aren't providing sensitive resistance at the moment. So I do think that this is urgent to have in protocol.

227
00:41:54.900 --> 00:42:00.650
potuz: I also think that, some, some… Some objective, comments,

228
00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:07.910
potuz: We… it's clear that most core devs, if not all core devs, want to have fossil in protocol.

229
00:42:08.030 --> 00:42:18.509
potuz: It's, also clear that, it interacts in a highly non-trivial manner with current EPBS for the current fork.

230
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:33.989
potuz: And, if there is some kind of consensus in having shorter slot times in the next work, it also interacts in a highly non-trivial way. With that actually might be the case that one would make it impossible for the other PR.

231
00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:43.260
potuz: So I agree with Thomas that it is, at a point, it is just a political decision of whether it should be included or not.

232
00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:51.599
potuz: So it's really a matter of, like, saying what are the priorities. But it should be clear that it could be the case

233
00:42:51.600 --> 00:43:04.960
potuz: that having shorter slot times makes it impossible to have fossil, or it could be the case that having fossil now would make it impossible to have shorter slot times. And I think we should realize that this is the situation.

234
00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:10.760
potuz: Or at least not the numbers that people are talking about with having 6-second slots.

235
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:14.019
potuz: Now, as for the…

236
00:43:14.490 --> 00:43:25.709
potuz: complications of implementing and testing this. I have no clue, and I cannot speak for the EL teams. What is really clear is that the big overhaul of fossil is on the CL side.

237
00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:33.379
potuz: And it's more than just the gas repricing and these kind of things, where the EL devs can start working already.

238
00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:49.089
potuz: On the fossil side, we're very far from starting working already. I just saw the PR open on the EPBS side a few days ago when I saw it. It was just bare bones and was lacking a bunch of things, so we're… in the fossil side, we're really at the drawing board.

239
00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:59.090
potuz: we're really at the specing board. Even EPBS, the spec for EPBS is not completely closed, there are some changes to purchase that are still needed to add, and so I think it's…

240
00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:04.259
potuz: We are far away from being in a situation where we can actually say, yeah, this…

241
00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:11.180
potuz: I mean, you can guess 3 months, 2 months, whatever it is, but we know that those timings are never going to work.

242
00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:16.250
potuz: Whatever we say now, yeah, possibly it's going to delay for 2 months, for 3 months, it's just…

243
00:44:16.590 --> 00:44:30.489
potuz: out of nowhere. Those numbers are out of nowhere. We have no clue how we're gonna start testing these things. And especially, both EPBS and Fossil are time-sensitive. We need to set up some timings, and we need to test

244
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:46.970
potuz: in a decentralized manner, we cannot test on a devnet, we need to test on a large testnet to even set those limits, and after we test, we're gonna find out if it actually works. It might be that we just don't have the space to have these messages floating around.

245
00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.260
potuz: So…

246
00:44:48.530 --> 00:45:04.930
potuz: So we need to admit that it's going to be complicated to test, it's going to be a lot of delay, not only of APBS, but of shorter slot times, and we need to be clear about what are our priorities. My priority would be to have Fossil, regardless of any kind of delay.

247
00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:14.800
potuz: On the other hand, on the political side, I believe that client teams are already working on fossil, and they will work on fossil, regardless of whether or not it's SFI or not.

248
00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:23.600
potuz: So… and people are not delayed on this. I mean, there's more people in… there were more people implementing Fosula a few weeks ago than people implementing EPVS.

249
00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:31.370
potuz: So, I would expect that whatever happens on ACD, fossil will get implemented on top of EPBS anyways.

250
00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:42.289
potuz: So I think it's… it can be realistic to continue working on this, and whenever we actually have an implementation, pressure to have it included immediately.

251
00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:51.130
potuz: I know this is not something that people like, but I do believe that this is the thing that has the most chances of

252
00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:52.260
potuz: Passing.

253
00:45:57.230 --> 00:45:59.630
soispoke: Okay, thanks.

254
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:14.509
soispoke: I think, yeah, there are a lot of points. One of them was, that I'm particularly interested in is, also, like, why do you think, 6-second shorter slots

255
00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.130
soispoke: might not be possible to ship with the PBS.

256
00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:26.300
soispoke: Cause I, I wrote something… That makes it…

257
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:32.150
soispoke: Unlikely, but I was just wondering if you have, like, more thoughts on that?

258
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:51.170
potuz: No, no, an EPBS. With EPBS, I think it's possible. It's harder than with the current slot structure, but I think it's just perfectly possible. We did test already with the NetherMind guy's 6-second slots, and it was more stable with EPBS than without EPBS.

259
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:56.899
potuz: What I believe it's a complication is to add fossil on top of it, because it adds different deadlines.

260
00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:01.150
potuz: And we just don't know how those deadlines interact yet.

261
00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:18.360
soispoke: Okay, yeah, I mean, I agree, but, like, not knowing exactly how the deadlines will work out, but, like, the thing I shared, which, yeah, I think you read at the time.

262
00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:27.789
soispoke: I mean, it's, like, basically the worst case scenario we can get into between Fossil and EPBS, but also between Fossil and shorter slots.

263
00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.770
soispoke: Is that you might have…

264
00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:40.389
soispoke: transactions in the inclusion list that are already, included. So, like, so not, like, the freshest inclusion lists ever, basically.

265
00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:43.100
soispoke: But… that…

266
00:47:43.820 --> 00:47:53.220
soispoke: would probably be the worst case. So it's always best, you know, to have, like, the freshest inclusion list based on, like, the latest head and whatever.

267
00:47:53.220 --> 00:48:09.420
soispoke: But I do think that if you… even if you reduce, sort of, like, the slot time, and you have, like, tighter deadlines, for EPBS, and, like, how these interact, like, the worst case scenario you can get into is, like, not having the freshest IELTs, which is…

268
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.750
soispoke: in my opinion, fine. Like an okay trade-off to her, to have.

269
00:48:13.830 --> 00:48:17.990
soispoke: But so, yeah, I just want to make sure, like, that's sort of, like,

270
00:48:18.110 --> 00:48:27.830
soispoke: the right way to think about it, because if it's the case, it's different than saying, you know, they can't be shipped. Like, one can't be shipped without the other.

271
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:29.419
soispoke: So yeah.

272
00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:32.160
soispoke: Okay, nice.

273
00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:41.350
soispoke: Cool. And then about messages going around, I, I…

274
00:48:42.280 --> 00:49:00.350
soispoke: Yeah, I agree, it's hard to predict exactly, but, like, you know, like, at the end of the day, like, the whole, sort of, like, inclusion list, like, 16 inclusion lists make up for, like, one blob of data that's going through the network, and I think, yeah, nodes can afford that.

275
00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:01.630
soispoke: For sure.

276
00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:08.970
soispoke: And how far could you reduce slot times without breaking

277
00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:25.749
soispoke: Fossil. So, what I'm saying is, like, what I think, but, like, yeah, I mean, we can spend time on it and, like, iterate a bit more. What I think is, like, no amount of, slot times will break Fossil, because it just…

278
00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:30.830
soispoke: It just will mean that you have Slots that update

279
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:37.290
soispoke: faster than you can produce, fresh inclusion lists, which is…

280
00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:48.149
soispoke: not ideal, because it just means, like, a lot of, like, transactions in the inclusion list will already be included, but I don't think it's terrible.

281
00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:55.750
soispoke: Yeah, at one point, I do think it might break, but, like, yeah, that's my view on it. Like, I don't think,

282
00:49:57.310 --> 00:50:12.899
soispoke: Yeah, I don't think, like, you can break first all in a way, like, it just, like, Fossil will be a bit less efficient, in a way, because it won't only contain transactions that have never been included in previous blogs.

283
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.980
soispoke: Yep.

284
00:50:17.110 --> 00:50:17.970
soispoke: Amid…

285
00:50:19.510 --> 00:50:36.699
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I just wanted to add that, maybe we should not reason with the, by the time estimation, and delays. Maybe we should remind the contributors that, about the, the, the EIP process itself.

286
00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:53.990
Mehdi Aouadi: which, if I remember correctly, was reviewed a few months ago, and we said that for an EAP to get SFI'd, it should have some working implementation. And that's definitely the case today for Fossil. We have many CL and EL implementations, so…

287
00:50:54.130 --> 00:51:09.120
Mehdi Aouadi: That's a good point. And another thing, in my opinion, delaying fossil would also make it harder to include in the future, because we will end up having some

288
00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:15.830
Mehdi Aouadi: State branches, and diverging branches, and it's…

289
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:28.170
Mehdi Aouadi: Already with EPBS, it's getting hard, like, to rebase everything on top of it. If we keep delaying it, we will just add complexity, like, on maintaining the fossil implementation, so…

290
00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:38.290
Mehdi Aouadi: Maybe we should also, emphasize that and remind the contributors that, yeah, Fossil checks all the boxes, like, to get SFI.

291
00:51:41.530 --> 00:51:48.939
soispoke: Yeah, 100%. I think that those are, like, great arguments, too. Yeah, thanks for sharing.

292
00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:08.889
soispoke: And then I, yeah, I guess I also agree with Potus that I… I mean, I also happen to think that…

293
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:22.850
soispoke: like, permissionlessness and censorship resistance, or, like, I guess, inclusion rights, are basically the… one of the super core properties, blockchains provide generally, so…

294
00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:27.100
soispoke: I feel like, yeah, we shouldn't, make,

295
00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:30.399
soispoke: We shouldn't think too hard about this one, but

296
00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:34.779
soispoke: But yeah, I think it's great, like, those are, like, really good arguments.

297
00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:36.940
soispoke: Yes.

298
00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:51.680
potuz: Oh, I have a comment, a request that surely will not be popular in this crowd, but I think this is the right crowd to make this request. There are some components of fossil

299
00:52:51.830 --> 00:52:59.039
potuz: on the EL, that, if ACD decides not to SFI fossil.

300
00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:08.320
potuz: I would want to ask EL clients to anyways implement them, and we can adapt those components for EPBS.

301
00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:23.820
potuz: if there is a transaction that is actively being censored, I mean, that's part of the… of constructing the inclusion list. The EL can find a transaction that is being censored, and can notify the CL that there is this transaction that should be included.

302
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:28.859
potuz: And EPBS allows for any validator to blacklist immediately all builders.

303
00:53:28.980 --> 00:53:43.890
potuz: When there is such a transaction. So if I see a builder that is not included in a transaction, that my EL is telling me that transaction should have been included, Vanilla Software should be able, on EPBS, to not call anymore that builder.

304
00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:50.950
potuz: And I think if fossil doesn't get accepted on ACD, we should push to have at least this

305
00:53:51.160 --> 00:54:00.889
potuz: already implemented in EL clients, because I believe it's already implemented in EL clients, and for EPVS, it would only require a change in the engine API.

306
00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:16.630
soispoke: that makes sense. I don't think that's a controversial statement to make. I mean, like, everything that can improve censorship resistance, I think, is good. The… I think one…

307
00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:23.379
soispoke: Yeah, I have to think a bit harder, I feel like,

308
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:30.820
soispoke: The default for a lot of people will just… to…

309
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:39.590
soispoke: I mean, we haven't seen, like, any sort of, like, big pushback when builders started censoring transactions in the past.

310
00:54:39.790 --> 00:54:43.410
soispoke: So I feel like leaning on reactivity.

311
00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:49.535
soispoke: For, you know, big, for example, validator pools or whatever to…

312
00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.840
soispoke: To change their behavior might also…

313
00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:08.740
soispoke: Or would you suggest it's, like, a default thing that triggers automatically? Like, I don't know how you think about it. Like, will you request an actual action from the validator that wants to disconnect from a builder, or would it be something that triggers?

314
00:55:08.940 --> 00:55:10.839
soispoke: This triggered automatically.

315
00:55:11.230 --> 00:55:29.110
potuz: It should be something automatic. If you see a transaction that wasn't included, then by a builder… so, because the problem before was that we didn't know who the builder was, so you couldn't disconnect, because the relay could be saying, could be anything, could give the block to anyone.

316
00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:34.939
potuz: So we had non-censoring relays in which censoring builders were winning the auction.

317
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:47.509
potuz: What changes with the PBS is that now anyone can see not only the proposer, but anyone can see who's built the block, and they can know immediately that they built a censoring block.

318
00:55:47.920 --> 00:56:00.620
potuz: So if the EL is telling you that builder there did not include this transaction, just don't call it anymore. I think this should be the default on clients, and yes, people might want to fork it, or we might even…

319
00:56:00.620 --> 00:56:09.060
potuz: see push to have a configuration plug to change this, and yes, this is not as strong as possible, of course, but…

320
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:11.270
potuz: Default stick.

321
00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.300
potuz: And I think this is a good default to have anyways.

322
00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.170
soispoke: Yep, I agree.

323
00:56:21.810 --> 00:56:32.130
soispoke: Yeah, yeah, no, I think those make sense. I think defaults are sticky as well, which is also why I was pushing quite hard against having, like, an opt-in fossil.

324
00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:43.400
soispoke: thing, but, yeah, I think the only other thing you would lose is, like, not having 16 people, doing that, and just, like, relying on your own, sort of.

325
00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:54.009
soispoke: view, but yeah, always better than nothing. I don't think it's, yeah, controversial at all, I think everything that can be done to improve the, like, current state of things should be done, basically.

326
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:10.520
Jihoon: But that's something that we can also try.

327
00:57:10.650 --> 00:57:18.639
Jihoon: even we… go with PBS with Fossil, right? Even if we don't… I mean, like, even if we…

328
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:22.580
Jihoon: decide to DFI fossil, we can still

329
00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:26.850
Jihoon: use this component in the PBS, as you described.

330
00:57:31.150 --> 00:57:33.760
Jihoon: I'm gonna replace it. Oh, is it? Okay.

331
00:57:34.710 --> 00:57:37.910
Jihoon: Right, as a… as a… as a replacement, you mean? Okay.

332
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:51.650
soispoke: I mean, yeah, I mean, I agree it's not a fossil replacement, and it's not as strong at all, but, like, I mean, maybe there could also just be an EIP drafted for it.

333
00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:59.250
soispoke: The only problem there is, like, it obviously won't… B.

334
00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:09.749
soispoke: compliant with, some of the arguments that were really good, I think, and made by MIDI, that it won't be, you know, tested or have anything sort of, like,

335
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:16.250
soispoke: yeah, it will be very new and very fresh, but also not that complex, so I don't know.

336
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:23.090
Jihoon: Gotcha.

337
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:36.629
Jihoon: It's really great to have, yeah, Nico, do you want to share something?

338
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:42.189
nflaig: Yeah, I just want to know if there's a difference to the current should override builder that we have?

339
00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:48.540
nflaig: I mean, I guess in EPBS, you could say, okay, the previous builder was censoring, so you blacklist that one.

340
00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:57.110
nflaig: But what we have right now is we would just fall back to local blocks if the EL returns true for should overwrite.

341
00:58:57.700 --> 00:59:05.349
nflaig: But I just haven't seen good adoption from the EL side on that. I'm only aware of NetherMind having this behind the feature flag.

342
00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:22.929
potuz: Yeah, so it should be… it should be different, it should… that flag there is when you request a payload, to propose yourself, and then the EL tells you there's censorship going on, just build your… yourself.

343
00:59:23.180 --> 00:59:43.159
potuz: What I'm thinking is a different one, which is already part of Fossil itself, is when you send a new payload, you're syncing a block, part of sending the payload, the reply, instead of, like, being just accepted or syncing or valid, should be, accepted, syncing valid, but it was a censoring payload.

344
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:51.149
potuz: And that's it, it's just a Boolean. And your EL has free rights to decide this payload was censoring or not.

345
00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:58.580
potuz: and the CL can take care quickly out of that. You just send your payload when you're syncing, get the fact that it was a sensory payload.

346
00:59:58.710 --> 01:00:03.439
potuz: And you know who the builder is, just blacklist that builder immediately.

347
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:20.950
potuz: So it doesn't really need an EIP either, because it's just on the engine API, it's not part of core protocol. I could write an EIP for this, but it's just changing the API.

348
01:00:26.230 --> 01:00:33.639
Jihoon: Alright, it might be a… good mitigation we might want to have when we decide to DFI fossil.

349
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:40.700
Jihoon: So… Yeah, it's really great to have many…

350
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:43.949
Jihoon: Opinions and perspective on the table.

351
01:00:44.520 --> 01:00:48.419
Jihoon: Yeah, if we decide, let's see how it goes.

352
01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:58.560
Jihoon: We're almost hitting up one hour. Does anyone have more comments, feedback, or thoughts to share?

353
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:09.169
soispoke: No, just thinking about Botti's idea, then…

354
01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.729
soispoke: There will still basically need to…

355
01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:19.780
soispoke: yeah, come up with, like, a good heuristic to determine the transaction wasn't sold, because…

356
01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:28.900
soispoke: It's also, you know, it's not an objective criteria, it's not like… it's not like your label is attached to a transaction, it's more like…

357
01:01:29.020 --> 01:01:34.369
soispoke: it's been pending in the mempool for X amount of time and hasn't been included, so…

358
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:43.970
soispoke: That would be to be a bit more thought about, like, the heuristic people may want to use, but yeah, just a thought.

359
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.330
Jihoon: Yeah, that sounds like a… offable… strategy.

360
01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:03.730
Jihoon: Alright, do we have any other comments we want to have?

361
01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.769
Jihoon: Otherwise, I think we can go ahead and wrap up this call.

362
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:30.409
Jihoon: I mean… Alright then, thanks for joining, everyone. Hope you have a great rest of your day.

363
01:02:30.590 --> 01:02:35.349
Jihoon: As always, I'm gonna share the summary of this call, but…

364
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:41.840
