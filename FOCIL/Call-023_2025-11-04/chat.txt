00:11:35	Pooja Ranjan:	gm
00:12:11	nflaig:	no updates, we are working on ebps since our focil implementation is mostly complete on top of fulu
00:13:03	Mehdi Aouadi:	Same for Teku. Working on ePBS and our FOCIL impl is on top of FULU
00:16:01	Mehdi Aouadi:	This is the spec rebasing PR right? https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4714
00:17:05	soispoke:	Replying to "This is the spec reb..."

Yes!
00:17:09	Mehdi Aouadi:	Reacted to "Yes!" with 👍
00:17:58	Jihoon:	Reacted to "Yes!" with 👍
00:23:00	NC:	For Lodestar, we still need to discuss internally and form an opinion. But it shouldnt be drastically different from what we said during Glamsterdam Headliner couple months ago
00:24:19	Marc:	Nethermind team generally supports FOCIL for glamsterdam, though hard to say atm what the trade off is with delaying ePBS
00:25:44	NC:	X = 3 imo
00:27:21	nflaig:	I think the main concern is that it would further delay BALs unless we ship EL only fork
00:28:36	potuz:	There is no EL only fork
00:29:25	nflaig:	it could work if you don't need CL changes but BALs do need engine api changes so not applicable anyways
00:29:50	potuz:	The payload structure changes, this requires CL structure changes
00:38:15	raxhvl:	BAL will be affected by pricing change especially state access
00:47:07	soispoke:	https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/epbs-focil-compatibility/24777#p-60326-order-independence-3 I think the order independence here makes it compatible with both ePBS and shorter slots
00:48:17	potuz:	I agree with that take
00:48:39	Marc:	how far could you reduce slot times without breaking focil?
00:48:51	potuz:	no one can tell you that
00:49:12	Jihoon:	Replying to "how far could you re..."

there was an effort to run some benchmark around IL propagation, but it's just been on the back burner
00:49:53	potuz:	ILs will not be the bottleneck anyway, attestation propagation is the bottleneck to shorter slot times
00:50:01	potuz:	as long as IL propagation can be done in parallel it should be fine
00:51:10	Justin Florentine (Besu):	thats an excellent argument
00:52:05	Justin Florentine (Besu):	i'm not even sure how you would try to make the same arg for gas repricing
00:52:11	Jihoon:	Replying to "thats an excellent a..."

sorry, which one are you referring to?
00:53:23	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "thats an excellent a..."

Mehdi's point about FOCIL being further along development wise, and much closer to SFI status per our process
00:53:31	Jihoon:	Reacted to "Mehdi's point about ..." with 👍
00:53:38	soispoke:	Reacted to "Mehdi's point about ..." with 👍
00:53:55	nflaig:	does any EL besides Nethermind support `shouldOverrideBuilder`?
00:54:08	Jihoon:	Replying to "thats an excellent a..."

that's true, I personally didn't imagine that we would have 2 EL client impls in the bottom-up fashion
00:56:35	Justin Florentine (Besu):	eth_nameAndShameBuilder
00:57:06	Marc:	Reacted to "eth_nameAndShameBuil…" with 😂
00:57:08	potuz:	yeah and also it's not in protocol and part of attestations... definitely not a FOCIL replacement
00:57:20	soispoke:	Reacted to "yeah and also it's n..." with 👍
01:00:43	soispoke:	“if” we decide 🙂
01:01:11	nflaig:	https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/pull/425  there wasn't an eip for this either
01:01:29	potuz:	Reacted to "https://github.com/e..." with 👍
