00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.310
soispoke: Hello!

2
00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.760
Pooja Ranjan: Good morning!

3
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.380
soispoke: How are you?

4
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.209
Pooja Ranjan: I'm doing very good. How about you? I noticed you are going to have a presentation today.

5
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.640
soispoke: Yes, I wanted to also sort of like test. If the sharing thing works

6
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.519
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, I I can see your screen. You can just go to slideshow mode, and it would work out.

7
00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:52.794
soispoke: Let me try again.

8
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.840
soispoke: Okay? And then.

9
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.089
Pooja Ranjan: Slideshow on the right top. Yes.

10
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.539
soispoke: Yeah. But just tell me if what you see now.

11
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:05.740
Pooja Ranjan: Presenter view.

12
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.029
Pooja Ranjan: Oh, I assume a presenter view will have

13
00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:14.829
Pooja Ranjan: notes if there are any. No, I can't see any notes, so just the slides.

14
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.689
soispoke: And can you see notes now.

15
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:17.480
Pooja Ranjan: No.

16
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.814
soispoke: Okay, nice. It works. Then.

17
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.770
Pooja Ranjan: Yep.

18
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.750
soispoke: Thanks.

19
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:24.510
Pooja Ranjan: No worries.

20
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:33.949
Pooja Ranjan: Just let me know to transition, and we would start, or even if you can just pause for 2, 3 seconds, I can move over the transition whenever you're ready.

21
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.749
soispoke: Yeah. Sounds good. Thanks.

22
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:07.850
soispoke: Alright.

23
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.530
soispoke: GM, everyone. Thanks for joining

24
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.190
soispoke: fossil breakout session number 16. Yeah. I think we can start the recording when you're ready.

25
00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:21.870
soispoke: Pooja.

26
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.660
Pooja Ranjan: Real life.

27
00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.699
soispoke: Okay? Great. Yeah. Thanks for joining again. I think

28
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:35.870
soispoke: agenda for today is going to be. So I'm gonna do a small presentation.

29
00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:44.360
soispoke: just like about the post. I had let me share the link actually on epbs and fossil compatibility.

30
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.740
soispoke: So we will start with this.

31
00:07:47.504 --> 00:08:05.569
soispoke: And then, maybe, like your Glamsterdam temperature check would be nice. I I do have some questions, I guess, but like we, I don't know if we're gonna spend like much time on it to be honest. And then any sort of like additional things you guys want to talk about, of course.

32
00:08:06.272 --> 00:08:10.700
soispoke: Okay, let me go ahead and share my screen.

33
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.220
soispoke: Okay, can you guys see the full slide?

34
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:27.100
soispoke: Nice? Okay.

35
00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:52.649
soispoke: okay? So yeah, it's supposed to be very interactive. It's literally like going through a post. So and we are gonna get a bit in the weeds like not too crazy, but like still a bit into like the slot structure and everything. So if anything is unclear or you have questions like, do interrupt me like, don't wait until the end of the presentation or anything.

36
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.090
soispoke: Okay? So fossil and epbs.

37
00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:03.790
soispoke: It's just like, yeah. There were like, quite a lot of questions about, like, how all the different

38
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.120
soispoke: vip is compatible. What is.

39
00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:15.670
soispoke: Yeah, what does fossil look like with epbs? What it? What does it look like with like delayed execution or shorter slot times

40
00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:20.370
soispoke: turns out now we have 3 like candidate

41
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:25.819
soispoke: candidates remaining, I think, for for headliners for Glamsterdam.

42
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:32.829
soispoke: and turns out epbs and fossil are are 2 of them. So maybe it's important to like, go

43
00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:42.370
soispoke: do it again. And like, yeah, look at the slotted anatomy, and how how it might look like in in practice. And you'll see like it turns out like.

44
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:48.809
soispoke: it's quite nice, like they actually go quite well together because the Tldr is like the

45
00:09:48.910 --> 00:10:01.640
soispoke: beacon block execution payload separation is quite useful for fossil when you have added sort of like constraints on the payload itself that

46
00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.680
soispoke: shouldn't necessarily like touch anything on the beacon chain side.

47
00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:14.289
soispoke: Yeah, so reminder. But I mean, this is like for

48
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:37.350
soispoke: a very educated audience already, I think what I want to emphasize still is like we are going to talk about the slot pipelining part of epbs like we are not going to get into, like the, you know, unconditional payment part or like stake builders like it's really going to be about understanding the slot structure. So we are not really going to get into these.

49
00:10:37.350 --> 00:10:48.830
soispoke: And then, 1st of all, I mean, I don't need to to explain this. So yeah, the question was, how does the slot anatomy or structure, or, yeah, pipelining, or whatever? Look? Oh.

50
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:52.039
soispoke: that's weird. Can you say, guys see anything?

51
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:54.779
soispoke: What? The fuck? Okay?

52
00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:00.079
Pooja Ranjan: Do we have any?

53
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:04.640
Jessica: Do you have any more?
