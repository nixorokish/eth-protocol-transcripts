00:12:06	Jihoon:	Maybe you're sharing your browser?
00:14:34	thomasthiery:	arxiv link: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13751
00:24:04	Justin Florentine (Besu):	sorry i'm late, is there a link to these slides in the chat history?
00:24:36	thomasthiery:	Not yet, I can ask Aikaterini to share them after the talk!
00:24:42	Justin Florentine (Besu):	ty!
00:26:57	Justin Florentine (Besu):	interesting. sounds like an interposition in chess... and they can pay to maintain it.
00:30:03	Mehdi Aouadi:	Replying to "sorry i'm late, is t..."

There was a link to the paper btw: https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13751
00:34:55	Jihoon:	Replying to "interesting. sounds ..."

umm.. what's the EIL5 of the interposition in chess? üòÖ
00:38:56	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "interesting. sounds ..."

getting in the way to protect space, at the opportunity cost of the piece you use
00:39:08	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "interesting. sounds ..."

or blocking an attack on a specific piece

00:50:32	Marc:	made some progress on Nethermind implementation, planning to test interop soon
00:51:15	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	Marc good question. Actually in our model we take into account that includers and block producer can add their own transactions to their inclusion lists/ block or the mempool trying to manipulate the payment mechanism.
00:52:29	Marc:	Replying to "Marc good question. ‚Ä¶"
Is that the IL flooding thing that you mentioned?
00:52:49	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	Yes exactly, and includes can do the same
00:52:55	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	includers
00:54:28	thomasthiery:	Aikaterini do you mind sharing the slides of your presentation?
00:54:38	thomasthiery:	And Marc maybe the link of your PR btw?
00:54:48	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	Yes sure
00:55:38	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16EMm1vwkYXbAi0yoStNCnODXBgxEeI_aQUDCupFSQSk/edit?usp=sharing
00:56:21	Marc:	https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/9396
00:57:17	Marc:	Replying to "Marc good question. ‚Ä¶"
the main thing I‚Äôm thinking about is if ordering by inclusion fee is the rational behaviour or if there might be better strategies or outside incentives
00:57:29	Marc:	Replying to "Marc good question. ‚Ä¶"
will read the paper :)
00:58:17	Aikaterini-Panagiota Stouka:	Yes, we explain what strategy deviations we cover like fake transaction insertion etc.
00:59:14	Mega | Lambda:	Bye!
