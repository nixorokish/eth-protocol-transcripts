00:10:13	unnawut:	Ah we also have to agree on the metrics. But since both ream and zeam have implemented metrics emitter already it’s just a matter of agreeing what to measure.
00:10:35	unnawut:	Replying to "Ah we also have to a..."

We can/should do this after the fork choice specs is merged
00:14:33	Katya Riazantseva:	you will love it 😄 It’s a great tool
00:15:27	unnawut:	If we can’t run on kurtosis then we need an alternative solution which I think could be concerning?
00:15:47	Katya Riazantseva:	Reacted to "If we can’t run on k..." with 👍
00:16:41	Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine:	Could you drop links of devnet branches of ream, zeam?
00:16:49	Will Corcoran:	https://github.com/b-wagn/hash-sig/pull/79
00:17:30	gajinder:	Replying to "Could you drop links..." 

 We zeam are just working and merging in main
00:17:31	Jun:	Replying to "Could you drop links..."

Ream is using  master  branch
00:18:06	Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine:	Replying to "Could you drop links…"
Thanks!

In theory, we may put our clients into the Shadow framework: specify clients execution commands in shadow configuration, provide genesis config and run. There will be no metrics, or block explorer, but if we just want to conveniently spin up a network it could be a way
00:22:43	Jun:	python spec code looks super clear and cool!
00:27:25	unnawut:	Replying to "If we can’t run on k..."

I’ve never used shadow before. But say if the client instance is exposing metrics on a port, can an external service e.g. prometheus access that port?
00:31:09	Giacomo Fenzi:	Q: do we perform domain separation in the XMSS signatures? Is this part of the spec?
00:36:27	Will Corcoran:	FYI: Thomas is going to be one of the primary presenters - along with @Justin Drake @felipe and Emile on Friday during lean consensus call #7 - encore performance + deep dive :)

00:36:51	Kamil Salakhiev:	What is going to be signature size with such configuration?

I can do it really quick

00:56:47	Jun:	I can provide a quick update on pq devnet visualization app:

Kicked off with  leanView  naming 😂
Hope I can demo it next week.
While building this app, I’ve been adding new endpoints for fetching block header, block, etc. It will be great if there’s any common API interface with teams. But it’ll be fine for just switching between client type in PQ Devnet 0.
00:57:12	Will Corcoran:	Reacted to "I can provide a quic..." with 🔥
00:57:20	Will Corcoran:	Replying to "I can provide a quic..."

00:58:22	Bubbles Notetaker:	🔔 Meeting scheduled to end in 5 mins. I'll stay until you're finished, and share a recording with notes for follow-ups.
00:58:30	Gajinder Singh:	Replying to "I can provide a quic..."

can we just say that these are the beacon apis client need to implement in the devnet0
00:58:39	Will Corcoran:	Replying to "🔔 Meeting scheduled..."

Thanks, bubbles
00:58:56	unnawut:	Reacted to "Thanks, bubbles" with 😀
00:59:01	Gajinder Singh:	Replying to "I can provide a quic..."

and similarly the events
00:59:03	Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari:	Reacted to "Thanks, bubbles" with 😀
00:59:43	Gajinder Singh:	Replying to "I can provide a quic..."

(and all ssz only)
01:00:07	Jun:	partially yes. I added two endpoints so far:

 /lean/v0/headers/{block_id} 
 /lean/v0/blocks/{block_id} 

I guess events are not necessary in this phase.
01:00:21	Gajinder Singh:	Reacted to "Thanks, bubbles" with 😀
01:00:34	felipe:	Reacted to "Thanks, bubbles" with 😀
01:00:41	Gajinder Singh:	Replying to "🔔 Meeting scheduled..."

i hope it doesn't auto end the meeting
01:00:54	Jun:	Replying to "I can provide a quic..."

I might raise this issue on Zeam TG
