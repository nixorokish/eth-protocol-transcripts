Ladislaus: Hi, folks.

3
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.429
Ladislaus: We are almost… Not enough people. Is the meeting canceled or not?

4
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.629
Ladislaus: Oh, do you happen to know that?

5
00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.659
unnawut: I'm not aware of any updates, so I assume it's still ongoing, that the chat.

6
00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.190
Ladislaus: because…

7
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.570
unnawut: The chapters.

8
00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:44.070
Ladislaus: Because I believe Will is… at least Will is traveling, I've heard.

9
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.699
Ladislaus: But I haven't seen, like, the event being taken of the… let me quickly take a look…

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.000
Ladislaus: of the, of the Ethereum calendar. Oh, it's still on there.

11
00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.360
Ladislaus: There's also an Islam issue?

12
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:06.159
Ladislaus: Oh, no, it's an old issue.

13
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.930
Ladislaus: Yeah, I mean, okay, we can…

14
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:23.409
unnawut: I mean, we… well, we have Reem and Zim and Clean here, so maybe a quick update from each team?

15
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.410
Ladislaus: Yeah, yeah, why not?

16
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.729
unnawut: Well, actually, yeah, we'll just post it.

17
00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:30.759
Ladislaus: Pardon? Starting now.

18
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.830
unnawut: I knew it was coming. I just saw it in the chat.

19
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:41.799
Ladislaus: Whoops, where… What happened in the chat? Sorry, I didn't see this.

20
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.890
unnawut: Oh, Will? Will just posted in chat that it's starting now, so I assume he's coming in.

21
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.049
Ladislaus: Oh, is it a different…

22
00:07:56.650 --> 00:07:59.290
Ladislaus: Okay, yeah, maybe we give it another 60 seconds.

23
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:04.930
Ladislaus: But, yeah, let me quickly check this Zoom link. Is it a new Zoom link? No.

24
00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.039
unnawut: Actually, it's… it looks different.

25
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:11.409
unnawut: For me.

26
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:15.920
Ladislaus: Void for…

27
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.339
Ladislaus: I will click on the… I will leave this meeting and see if… if any…

28
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.180
unnawut: Okay.

29
00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.130
Ladislaus: We'll just fail.

30
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.329
unnawut: Okay, so Kaden just said that we are in the wrong zoom link, so… oh.

31
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.389
unnawut: There are more people joining.

32
00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:39.770
unnawut: Interesting.

33
00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:46.960
unnawut: But since Will was there, I guess, like, let's join that one. I'll just post a link here.

34
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:54.590
unnawut: I see you in the other room.

35
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.740
Justin Drake: Hi, Tamara, are you here? Can you hear me?
