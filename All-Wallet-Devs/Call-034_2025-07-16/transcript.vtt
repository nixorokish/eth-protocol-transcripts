00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.090
Sam: Hello!

2
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.150
Akash | ECH: Hey! Hello!

3
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.080
Sam: Good. My audio is working first.st Try this time. It's it's a miracle.

4
00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:26.039
Sam: Hey, guys.

5
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.550
Vandan | MetaMask: Hello!

6
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:32.660
Fredrik: Hello!

7
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.070
Sam: How's it going.

8
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.149
Fredrik: Good, and you.

9
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.359
Sam: Yeah. Can't complain.

10
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.552
Vandan | MetaMask: Seems like things are getting busy and heating up lately. So.

11
00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.560
Sam: Oh, yeah.

12
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.390
Vandan | MetaMask: I see a lot of movement in a lot of fronts.

13
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:20.319
Fredrik: Yeah, I have. I have something I guess, maybe to discuss. I didn't add anything to the agenda, and I just saw your message sounds. I figured I wasn't planning to discuss it, but I saw your message. So

14
00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:27.079
Fredrik: from the one trillion security initiative. Quite a lot of work has been done on

15
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.829
Fredrik: A lot of the feedback has been around ux and how to improve ux from a security point of view, for

16
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:45.430
Fredrik: for for users in the ecosystem. And one idea that's been

17
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.160
Fredrik: been hard is to have some kind of

18
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:58.930
Fredrik: some type of a standard similar to L 2 beat. I know there is wallet beat, for example.

19
00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:09.899
Fredrik: but I'm not entirely sure where, like the ratings come from. But I I was imagining that this

20
00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.149
Fredrik: call could perhaps be a good idea at some point to to discuss, like what

21
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:33.969
Fredrik: what are, what what the wallets feel should be in this kind of rating guideline like what should be in order to have different stages of a wallet from a security point of view. Basically, I don't know if that's something that's been discussed

22
00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.140
Fredrik: in the past in this call, but that.

23
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:47.249
Sam: Quite a while ago. I think it was coin spec. That was. They came on and proposed like a criteria for wallet ranking, and they have a they have a github

24
00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:59.740
Sam: with that information published in it. They have some hidden criteria as well, because I guess they didn't wanna let people game. The ratings too much. But yeah, there's a document somewhere in the discord that has all that information.

25
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:10.420
Sam: and then the wallet beat group is on forecaster. I don't know if you're part of the the channel, but I can probably give you an invite if you want.

26
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:13.700
Fredrik: Yeah, I'm not part of it. So yeah, I would appreciate that.

27
00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:23.040
Sam: Okay, yeah. Shoot me. Your whatever equivalent of a username is for forecaster, and I will send it your way.

28
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.339
Fredrik: Okay, yeah. I'll send it to you.

29
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:32.100
Sam: Cool.

30
00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:38.650
Sam: Yeah, I'm actually really interested to see what what comes of the trillion dollar security kind of initiative.

31
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.699
Sam: it. It really does feel like

32
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:44.550
Sam: wallet. Ui has a lot of

33
00:07:44.850 --> 00:07:50.900
Sam: room for improvement, especially for non crypto native people. And yeah.

34
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.609
Sam: kind of excited to see where that goes.

35
00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.650
Fredrik: Yeah, there's probably gonna be an update in 2 weeks, basically

36
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:06.490
Fredrik: showing a bit of what's been done and what's been being worked on. And the ux part is.

37
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:12.803
Fredrik: it's the one thing that's going to have quite a bit of focus.

38
00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.040
Fredrik: But yeah, there will be more info in like 2 weeks.

39
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:22.360
Sam: Well, looking forward to it.

40
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:35.939
Sam: Yeah, I don't really have too much to talk about today or anything, really. And I think it's just been like 2 or 3 months since the last call. So

41
00:08:36.418 --> 00:08:40.180
Sam: yeah. If anybody has anything they want to chat about, go for it. Otherwise

42
00:08:40.429 --> 00:08:44.419
Sam: hang out for a bit, and then we can call it.

43
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.050
Sam: How are things on the Metamask front?

44
00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:57.001
Vandan | MetaMask: Yeah, I was just gonna say that we are close to launching an experimental

45
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:04.100
Vandan | MetaMask: new wallet Api pattern. We call it our multi chain. Api.

46
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:08.490
Vandan | MetaMask: We've been, we've I think we've brought it up a few times in the past. Haven't really

47
00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:13.351
Vandan | MetaMask: heavily gotten to the details of it, I guess.

48
00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:23.993
Vandan | MetaMask: But but now that we're we're close to actually having an experimental version available, probably makes more sense to to share more about that I'll

49
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.920
Vandan | MetaMask: post a link here. It's kind of more. The like has all the like technical references.

50
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:37.644
Vandan | MetaMask: You can also check out our our documentation. But basically the idea is that

51
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:59.270
Vandan | MetaMask: the multi chain Api shifts away from the pattern of having a 1 chain at a time model to having calls from the dap side that are ex explicitly directed to a particular chain, and

52
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:06.044
Vandan | MetaMask: and then can be routed accordingly. So sort of different model. There's some

53
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:15.270
Vandan | MetaMask: yeah, different patterns. But it also has some other side benefits around being able to

54
00:10:16.372 --> 00:10:28.989
Vandan | MetaMask: identify different capabilities of like wallets like the the networks that they support in a more dynamic way versus, I think today there's a lot of like kind of hard coding happening.

55
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.920
Vandan | MetaMask: And also ideally, we move towards more of a design where

56
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:42.179
Vandan | MetaMask: Dapps are designed to gracefully degrade. When a wallet has doesn't have a certain feature

57
00:10:42.575 --> 00:10:51.130
Vandan | MetaMask: that way we can. We can actually innovate a little more without worrying about kind of like just breaking things. Right now, I think there's a bit of a

58
00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.470
Vandan | MetaMask: chicken and egg situation, where, until there's like broad wallet adoption of something like

59
00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:08.359
Vandan | MetaMask: no one wants to integrate it. So it it. I think it slows things down a bit, whereas I think if we had a mo more of a model where

60
00:11:08.610 --> 00:11:27.900
Vandan | MetaMask: you the da the daps, can check for a capability or a feature or an endpoint if it's there, then they can use it and take advantage of the feature. And then, if a wall, you know, if they find that a certain wallet doesn't have that, then they just gracefully degrade. That's that's kind of a pattern we're hoping to

61
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:31.702
Vandan | MetaMask: shift towards as as an industry as well. So

62
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:37.750
Vandan | MetaMask: so that's just to wet your appetite on it. Yeah, definitely take a peek

63
00:11:38.615 --> 00:11:41.540
Vandan | MetaMask: share your feedback. We.

64
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:51.389
Vandan | MetaMask: We'll have it live. It's currently live on our on the Metamask extension. So already something that people can play with there

65
00:11:51.984 --> 00:11:59.739
Vandan | MetaMask: and then we should have it live on our mobile app soon. So so we'll

66
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.829
Vandan | MetaMask: there's there's an opportunity up.

67
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.127
Vandan | MetaMask: Give that new interface a try.

68
00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.150
Vandan | MetaMask: and yeah, let us let us know

69
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:14.939
Vandan | MetaMask: what you think in terms of applications. And

70
00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:24.079
Vandan | MetaMask: yeah, more to come on that front. But we're our hope is that it? It helps improve ethereum ux and developer experience, too, because there's a lot of like

71
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:33.718
Vandan | MetaMask: kind of error handling you have to do with when with chain switching and all that. So we're hoping that there's more of a shift towards

72
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:50.099
Vandan | MetaMask: daps that kind of control, the the networks that they're that they're interacting with from the dap side. The users we've already made changes in the Metamask Wallet to pair with this Api. So we're kind of training users to just look

73
00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:58.949
Vandan | MetaMask: at particular transactions rather than assuming that they're in some like network context for everything in the wallet.

74
00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:05.399
Sam: Yeah. The modal design for wallets, I think, was kind of a bad ux decision from the start.

75
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:28.930
Vandan | MetaMask: Right. It was a lot of kind of like, Hey, you're you're everything you do is on this one network, right? And so that. I think that's already started to break down. And I think we don't. We didn't wanna constrain daps to be limited in their design because of the wallets design choices. So

76
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:40.750
Vandan | MetaMask: what this Api does is really sort of takes everything off. The developer can create, adapt that like has interactions with multiple different networks. Has its own ui for kind of

77
00:13:41.498 --> 00:13:51.580
Vandan | MetaMask: picking networks for different interactions and then also potentially also getting multiple like interacting with different accounts at the same time, too. So

78
00:13:51.980 --> 00:14:15.277
Vandan | MetaMask: the ui of Metamask still is like one account at a time. Context. But it doesn't mean the dap has to do things that way. And they could even trigger transactions on different accounts. And that'll all just come through in the wallet so the user just has to kind of be more aware when they when they get a confirmation, they need to actually look at

79
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:21.720
Vandan | MetaMask: the networks and and the accounts that that are being requested for that confirmation.

80
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:26.069
Sam: No, that's super cool.

81
00:14:26.781 --> 00:14:34.010
Sam: Is this kind of like a a alternative or or replacement for the Cape that looks similar.

82
00:14:34.590 --> 00:15:04.210
Vandan | MetaMask: It's an implementation of Cave 25, and it's all the whole family of things. That branch off of Cave 25. So yeah, it's it's a chain agnostic. We're using it for that right now to even go outside of the ethereum domain. But we think that it has benefits even. You know, when you just look at ethereum kind of above and beyond the Eip, 1193 Provider interface patterns.

83
00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:06.999
Vandan | MetaMask: So it's yeah. We see some like

84
00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:14.259
Vandan | MetaMask: It's as an alternative to eip 1193 provider.

85
00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.990
Vandan | MetaMask: And there's been some chatter about potentially

86
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:27.349
Vandan | MetaMask: reflecting that into some sort of ethereum proposal, but not exactly sure how that how that

87
00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:41.468
Vandan | MetaMask: like, where that would be go is like, is it an eip? Is it some sort of like informational eip? Because it's sort of defined in these like chain agnostic standards. And and we have. If you look at

88
00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:53.346
Vandan | MetaMask: there's also mi, there's Mip 5, which is like the general generic. Pattern. That's kind of like, not specific to ethereum. I'll share that here as well.

89
00:15:54.250 --> 00:16:00.959
Vandan | MetaMask: but yeah, we think that it's like really useful for an Evm space because of chain switching. In particular.

90
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:10.659
Sam: No, the value is definitely there. I don't think, I don't think you need to convince anybody that it's a very useful thing to to do.

91
00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:15.300
Sam: No, that's awesome. I'm really glad to see that Metamask is working on this

92
00:16:16.028 --> 00:16:20.951
Sam: and that's for like how, if you want to bring it into the vips world.

93
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.370
Sam: it'd probably be best as just an Erc, and then

94
00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:34.482
Sam: yeah, put it in there and then eventually it make its way into the execution. Apis. Maybe.

95
00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:42.240
Sam: that's actually something we we talked about briefly before, and we might want to talk about again at some point is creating a

96
00:16:43.467 --> 00:16:48.159
Sam: like a common place to document wallet. Apis.

97
00:16:48.616 --> 00:16:53.610
Sam: Because right now it's mostly like the Metamask Api documentation, the alchemy api documentation.

98
00:16:54.042 --> 00:17:02.180
Sam: It'd be nice to have one that's just common for everybody, and then you could have like a a support table on it for the different wallets. Kind of like Mdn.

99
00:17:03.033 --> 00:17:08.986
Sam: We've talked about that in the past. I don't know if that's something anybody would be interested in pursuing, but

100
00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:11.969
Sam: probably should at some point.

101
00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:17.489
Vandan | MetaMask: Yeah, I think it would be great to get some yeah more guidance on on

102
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:30.379
Vandan | MetaMask: where some of this could go and how to reflect. It also seems like sometimes, if it's not in some kind of ethereum document, then it it's like the awareness is is low as well.

103
00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:45.779
Sam: Yeah, I mean, if it's just about getting like a a subdomain on ethereum.org. I don't think that would be too much of a problem. Especially if it's just like documentation. So.

104
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.940
Vandan | MetaMask: Great.

105
00:17:49.270 --> 00:17:52.850
Sam: Yeah, I can. I can definitely look into that and see if we can spin up a repo or something.

106
00:17:57.170 --> 00:18:03.610
Vandan | MetaMask: Yeah, I've also yeah, there's some folks in the chain agnostic Forum, who had some

107
00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:08.820
Vandan | MetaMask: ideas there, so I can consult with them again see if they

108
00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:19.549
Vandan | MetaMask: have a perspective on what the best approach is to reflect some of these chain agnostic things back to. If if there's some benefit in the ethereum domain like, how to reflect that back?

109
00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.230
Vandan | MetaMask: Cool. Yeah. Thank you. Thanks for checking it out.

110
00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:42.010
Sam: Yeah, thanks for bringing it up. I'm always excited to see stuff like this happening.

111
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:49.740
Sam: yeah, I guess.

112
00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:53.349
Sam: Anybody else have anything they want to chat about. Are we good for today?

113
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.999
Sam: Cool? Well, sounds like we're good for today.

114
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:14.439
Sam: thanks everybody for coming out a short call. But you know. Good content. We'll talk to you all in a month.

115
00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:15.900
Vandan | MetaMask: Cheers, thanks.
