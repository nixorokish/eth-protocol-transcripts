00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:54.365
Fredrik: Hello!

2
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.960
Sam: Hey? How's it going.

3
00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:01.820
Fredrik: Yeah, good.

4
00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:09.220
Fredrik: A bit of a birch allergy going on, but otherwise it's all good, and you.

5
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.420
Sam: I can't complain.

6
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.989
Sam: It's nice and cool today, which is nice.

7
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.870
Sam: Few minutes before we start, since people generally join a bit late.

8
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:30.539
Sam: Go ahead. Sorry.

9
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:38.730
Fredrik: Now I was just gonna say that I from my side. I kinda hope for some warmth. I think it's like 4 degrees

10
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.290
Fredrik: Celsius here, so not super warm.

11
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.920
Sam: That's chilly now. We were up to 27 a couple of days ago, and we're back down to 13, which I think is reasonable.

12
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:43.559
Anders Kristiansen: Figuring out shoes and jacket.

13
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.350
Sam: So let's say we start at 1 0 5, because I know you have to leave early.

14
00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:22.828
Sam: All right. I think we have a good number of people here. Let's get started. So welcome to meeting number 33, we have 3 items on the agenda today. We have

15
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:39.829
Sam: an introduction to trillion dollar security, a kind of a retrospective discussion on 7,702, and then a discussion on calculation and standardizing base fees. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Frederick, and

16
00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:42.060
Sam: we can talk about trillion dollar security.

17
00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:49.799
Fredrik: Yeah, thanks a lot. So just to give some information about

18
00:08:50.619 --> 00:08:56.683
Fredrik: what to worry about what I'm about to speak about. So the trillion dollar security initiative is

19
00:08:57.949 --> 00:09:06.759
Fredrik: this idea that we have things within the ethereum ecosystem that are

20
00:09:07.219 --> 00:09:22.219
Fredrik: that has room for improvements with regards to security. It can be anything. Really, it could be things related to the protocol. It can be wallet ux. It could be censoring

21
00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:30.049
Fredrik: Rpc. Endpoints it could be concerns about privacy.

22
00:09:30.539 --> 00:09:35.559
Fredrik: or you know the fact that a lot of people are falling victims to

23
00:09:36.659 --> 00:09:39.359
Fredrik: various attacks and etc.

24
00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:40.644
Fredrik: This

25
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:53.429
Fredrik: this is so so what we're trying to do is kind of collect information from the ecosystem about what areas

26
00:09:53.869 --> 00:09:58.986
Fredrik: they feel need some type of improvement.

27
00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:02.366
Fredrik: and when we have this

28
00:10:03.209 --> 00:10:05.929
Fredrik: information, the idea is that we will

29
00:10:06.929 --> 00:10:18.649
Fredrik: compile a report and then start working on executing these necessary changes in order to kind of improve the overall security of the ethereum ecosystem.

30
00:10:23.469 --> 00:10:25.728
Fredrik: I guess, for this call.

31
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:36.939
Fredrik: We don't have to dive deep into the like specific security concerns or thoughts that people have. If you do have any.

32
00:10:37.469 --> 00:10:44.189
Fredrik: I'm more than happy to speak about them on this call, but otherwise it would be

33
00:10:44.819 --> 00:10:50.139
Fredrik: interesting to get your feedback in some way or another on how we can improve

34
00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:57.009
Fredrik: the overall security of ethereum, you know, so we can hopefully on board billions of of users.

35
00:10:57.809 --> 00:11:06.789
Fredrik: and we have a few ways of doing that. We have a form on a website on the blog@blog.org.

36
00:11:07.279 --> 00:11:09.839
Fredrik: or you can also schedule

37
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:15.219
Fredrik: a short call with me, and we can discuss it one on one if you would be open to that

38
00:11:19.559 --> 00:11:22.949
Fredrik: I'll post the links here in the chat.

39
00:11:25.309 --> 00:11:28.909
Fredrik: If anyone do have any comments and want to discuss any.

40
00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:33.619
Fredrik: or give any feedback or such at this point in this. In this call.

41
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:43.069
Fredrik: I think it would be very interesting to hear your views so feel free to provide feedback.

42
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:57.840
Sam: Sure. So I kind of have a question. So what are the roles of like the Ef going to be versus what you expect from, say, wallet developers or other ecosystem members.

43
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:26.909
Fredrik: Yeah. Okay, yeah. So the Ef is. In my view, the Ef is acting as a coordinator here. We're collecting the feedback from various parts of the ecosystem. I've talked to, or we have talked to a lot of different entities, such as you know, end users projects, developers, security people, various financial institutions staking operations

44
00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:34.090
Fredrik: Vcs, etc, etc. Just to get this kind of overview of what's what people

45
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:39.940
Fredrik: are seeing as sort of the weak, weak points that we need to improve on.

46
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:48.759
Fredrik: Once we have done that like, I said, we are compiling this report of of this feedback in these findings.

47
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:58.200
Fredrik: and my view is then that you know the Ef. Continues to act as this kind of

48
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:04.860
Fredrik: coordinator to kind of provide feedback.

49
00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:14.029
Fredrik: you know, from a wallet point of view we've here. We like some some of these comments that we heard is that

50
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:21.363
Fredrik: it's hard for a non technical user to understand what they're signing

51
00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.557
Fredrik: and maybe, you know, part like

52
00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:29.019
Fredrik: action point from this could be to

53
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:36.090
Fredrik: discuss with a lot of the wallet developers around.

54
00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:38.319
Fredrik: How can we improve this?

55
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:45.140
Fredrik: Should there be, you know, some type of standard around how

56
00:13:46.050 --> 00:14:04.160
Fredrik: wallets should ensure the security of the users or minimize the risks of the users, etc. I think that's that's the next kind of step to to figure this out. So it's not the idea. In my opinion. It's not that the Ef. Should be doing everything. It's more

57
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:12.000
Fredrik: like trying to help facilitate and provide necessary

58
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:23.339
Fredrik: resources that might be missing, for example, might be relevant with some grants or other aspects to to help improve this, this security.

59
00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:42.869
Sam: Great. Thank you. And I guess what you're looking for from wallet developers is to to come on and fill out the form that you were talking about and schedule some time with you.

60
00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:52.259
Fredrik: Yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah. So it would be super interesting to hear the the insights of the wallet developers. What?

61
00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:55.809
Fredrik: What you perceive as the

62
00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:08.510
Fredrik: the major security concerns. That the system is facing. You know, if you have any thoughts on how that can be improved, that's great, but otherwise, you know, feel free to just

63
00:15:09.021 --> 00:15:14.830
Fredrik: let us know about the issues themselves. And then we can work together to try to find

64
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.340
Fredrik: potential solutions to these problems.

65
00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:30.207
Sam: Awesome thanks so much. Does anybody else have any questions or comments?

66
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:46.429
Sam: Alright. So I guess that means we can move on to our next topic, which is talking about 7, 7 0, 2, and how it's been going so far.

67
00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:54.890
Sam: how has it been going? I know some of you are from clients. Some of you are from wallets.

68
00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:58.750
Sam: Yeah. If anybody has any insights things to talk about, please do.

69
00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:22.123
Anders Kristiansen: It kind of sounds like no one has any. So

70
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:29.289
Anders Kristiansen: I kind of suggested it because I was interested in so client. If

71
00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.410
Anders Kristiansen: There's some limitations that was done in the memory pool.

72
00:16:35.944 --> 00:16:41.140
Anders Kristiansen: And actually, I was kind of interested in in how different wallet implementations was handling this.

73
00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.329
Anders Kristiansen: or if they experienced any issues.

74
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:47.079
Anders Kristiansen: But if no one has any opinions, I guess

75
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:48.790
Anders Kristiansen: it's not much of an issue.

76
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:08.349
Sam: Sounds like this might be a question to post in the discord and collect some responses. Async.

77
00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.540
Anders Kristiansen: Yeah, all right.

78
00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:19.959
Sam: Go ahead, Nicholas!

79
00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:25.479
Nicolas Consigny: Hey? I don't have like a direct feedback, because

80
00:17:25.659 --> 00:17:30.026
Nicolas Consigny: don't run a wallet. But I would have a question for Metamask.

81
00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:37.809
Nicolas Consigny: I think 7, 7 0, 2 is still like behind the developer

82
00:17:38.609 --> 00:17:45.149
Nicolas Consigny: sites, and like not directly rolled out to like the entire user base.

83
00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:50.849
Nicolas Consigny: Do you have any rough estimation or plans to share about like.

84
00:17:51.179 --> 00:17:53.549
Nicolas Consigny: when would you roll this out to?

85
00:17:55.289 --> 00:17:57.299
Nicolas Consigny: The greater user base

86
00:18:03.089 --> 00:18:12.249
Nicolas Consigny: I have and is directly for you, I guess, because I guess you're the only Metamask people person here.

87
00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.549
Vandan | MetaMask: Joel's here as well. I don't know.

88
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:15.559
Nicolas Consigny: Utah. Okay. Yeah.

89
00:18:16.530 --> 00:18:19.445
Vandan | MetaMask: Let's see if he he's he's the more technical one. But

90
00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:20.320
Nicolas Consigny: Okay.

91
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:22.880
Vandan | MetaMask: Woods. Okay?

92
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.900
Joao Tavares: I can answer. Sorry because you were asking about.

93
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.080
Joao Tavares: When are we rolling it out to all our users? Is that it.

94
00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:39.779
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah, what is like the plan? I I think it's still behind the developer, setting.

95
00:18:40.841 --> 00:18:45.670
Joao Tavares: So support for 7, 7 0, 2 should have should be rolled out for everyone.

96
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:47.180
Nicolas Consigny: Okay.

97
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:47.940
Joao Tavares: The.

98
00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:52.189
Joao Tavares: The only thing is the 1st version that we've rolled out

99
00:18:52.550 --> 00:19:00.120
Joao Tavares: like there was no way for a user to upgrade from within the wallet. So we're leveraging 5, 7, 9, 2

100
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:01.940
Joao Tavares: to perform

101
00:19:02.770 --> 00:19:10.079
Joao Tavares: like an upgrade just in time. So when adapt, you know, wants to submit a batch transaction.

102
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:22.889
Joao Tavares: That's when the user will need to upgrade. So at that moment we prompted to use and say, You know, to proceed, please, you know, confirm that you are willing to upgrade your way to a sports contract account.

103
00:19:23.737 --> 00:19:29.880
Joao Tavares: With, I think, the latest version that we've that we are rolling out.

104
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:40.570
Joao Tavares: It's it's already possible to upgrade from within the wallet like you can just go to your account details and upgrade from there and upgrade or downgrade either way.

105
00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:42.745
Joao Tavares: Oh.

106
00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:52.180
Nicolas Consigny: Alright. I'm I'm checking right now. Okay, thanks. Yeah. That's exactly what I was

107
00:19:52.823 --> 00:19:57.550
Nicolas Consigny: asking for. It's like the force upgrade button within the wallet.

108
00:19:59.070 --> 00:20:01.319
Joao Tavares: Yeah, that that is rolling out on the current release.

109
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:02.199
Nicolas Consigny: Oh, okay. Okay.

110
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.499
Sam: So Van did in the chat asked, is the question about whether we would do a mass migration.

111
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:21.839
Nicolas Consigny: No, no, no, like I I mean, you can't force people to.

112
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:23.116
Sam: Yeah, okay.

113
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:23.790
Nicolas Consigny: Yeah.

114
00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.650
Sam: Cool.

115
00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:26.940
Nicolas Consigny: It's yeah.

116
00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:31.620
Nicolas Consigny: But so then it's triggered currently on this.

117
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.739
Nicolas Consigny: Only if the dap requests so like.

118
00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:45.490
Nicolas Consigny: are you expecting most people to like. Use that to trigger this for the 1st time, or like. Would you push this button to be the main

119
00:20:46.351 --> 00:20:50.500
Nicolas Consigny: distribution arm of 7 sevens. Kind of like, what?

120
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:52.270
Nicolas Consigny: What do you expect? It.

121
00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:02.990
Joao Tavares: So that that's that's hard to say. Like ideally, you know, we would

122
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:09.520
Joao Tavares: like there would be no reason to push a user to upgrade easy way, unless there's

123
00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:19.839
Joao Tavares: a reason that will benefit the user at that moment. Right? And once that moment comes, that's probably when we'll prompt him and say, you know, to proceed, and from here onwards to get.

124
00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.400
Joao Tavares: You know you are going through this flow, so probably you'll benefit from a

125
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:37.349
Joao Tavares: improved ux. Then, you know, please do upgrade. Now, the 1st use case was batch transactions via daps. But as we've rolled out more and more features on top, we'll probably prompt the user.

126
00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:46.620
Joao Tavares: you know more and more times until it gets to a point where we just say, you know, it's better if you upgrade to get an overall improved experience. It's better to just upgrade straight away.

127
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:49.410
Joao Tavares: But yeah.

128
00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:52.690
Nicolas Consigny: Okay. Sounds fair, great. Thank you.

129
00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:08.080
Sam: Cool. So we're joined with by light client, or Matt who probably has a little bit more of an update on how 7 7 0, 2 is doing on Mainnet. So if you want to give us a little bit of an update that'd be

130
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.520
Sam: very appreciated.

131
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:13.830
lightclient: Hello.

132
00:22:14.790 --> 00:22:30.089
lightclient: yeah. I mean, honestly, I think that most of the wallets probably have a good idea of how it's working out for them. I can really only see right now what Dune is able to tell me, and unfortunately, because Dune doesn't have a way for us to know what the

133
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:41.939
lightclient: addresses that authorize an account. We really only kind of know who or which wallet delegation contracts are getting delegated to right now.

134
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:47.350
lightclient: So I would like to have a better idea of what the total value locked is. I know there's like some

135
00:22:47.470 --> 00:23:02.649
lightclient: metric for total value of Eth locked. I want to say it was a couple 1 million dollars of Eth. But that doesn't really tell you what the total value of the Erc 20 s. Are. It doesn't really tell you how many transactions these delegated accounts are using yet. So

136
00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:11.339
lightclient: we're missing a lot of like the most important metrics. But overall, it seems that 7 7 0 2 adoption is coming up. I saw Metamask kind of overtook.

137
00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:17.120
lightclient: Okay. X is the top delegated contract a couple days ago.

138
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:30.539
lightclient: and I think that total were a bit over 40,000 authorizations in 2 weeks. So I think overall things are are pretty good, especially considering that wallets are continuing to roll this out.

139
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:40.000
lightclient: But yeah, if anyone has those metrics, I would be curious what the Tvl, or I guess, asset under management of the contracts is so far.

140
00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:48.460
Sam: Do you know roughly, what percentage of like new transactions are? To 7, 7 0, 2 accounts.

141
00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:57.380
lightclient: Yeah, that's the thing. It's not really possible to determine this right now, via dune.

142
00:23:57.690 --> 00:23:59.549
lightclient: Because if you

143
00:23:59.810 --> 00:24:22.830
lightclient: you can't just look at the number of 7,702 transactions. Because that's only the beginning of the 7,702 story. You need to know which account signed the authorization, and because they don't have that recovered address in their database table, we can't then go look up to see how often that account is transacting after they make the authorization.

144
00:24:23.250 --> 00:24:27.589
Sam: You can't count calls into the delegate target. I don't know how dune works.

145
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:35.459
lightclient: Yeah. Dude, unfortunately, in the trace, doesn't have a way to know. It doesn't expose that the 7 702 proxy has really occurred.

146
00:24:38.970 --> 00:24:54.720
lightclient: I don't know. I also try. I tried to like look into doing something like looking through every call, and then pulling up the code related to that call, and seeing if there's a prefix of Ef related to it, and I ran into an issue. But I'm forgetting

147
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.169
lightclient: what the issue was now, but I could try and look into it again.

148
00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:05.810
lightclient: Yeah, if anyone has a connection at dune that we could talk to, that would be great. I feel like this is a pretty easy thing for them to do.

149
00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:12.399
lightclient: and I assume they're kind of aware of it, but it would be very helpful to get this sorted out in the next couple weeks.

150
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:28.099
lightclient: and I've talked to Kofi a little bit and and he's planning to have these stats in his in his website bundle bear.

151
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.919
lightclient: but as of now, it doesn't look like he has rolled any of that information on.

152
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.130
Sam: Cool. Well, thanks for the update man. We appreciate it.

153
00:25:52.680 --> 00:26:00.839
Sam: And I guess on that note is smart programmer 93 here by any chance, because I know you wanted to talk about standardizing base fee

154
00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.270
Sam: calculations.

155
00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:08.026
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Hey? Yes.

156
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:16.630
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: So we've been looking into how wallets calculate base fees, and

157
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:22.850
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: also suggest priority fees for transactions for different chains.

158
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:50.248
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: and we've been noticing that there is a lot of discrepancy between one wallet and another, and how they implement this. Some of them actually use the Rpc. Calls that they're supposed to use for example, or like they they directly call the Rpc. Endpoint. That for for each fee each get fee, and

159
00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:54.089
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: that, even for the suggested fee, and

160
00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.888
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: the other one, if I don't remember the exact name, let me try to get it.

161
00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:09.420
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Yeah. So.

162
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.139
Diptanshu Kakwani: Max priorities. You said 20.

163
00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.679
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Yeah, so there is that

164
00:27:21.050 --> 00:27:28.886
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: if gas price there is eth fee history, and there is also,

165
00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:38.600
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: if a Max priority fee per gas right? These 3 endpoints

166
00:27:40.390 --> 00:27:47.020
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: supposedly, should be sufficient to suggest like fees for for for transactions.

167
00:27:47.160 --> 00:28:01.700
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Now, the reason I'm I'm asking about this is is. And and talking about this is that because there are multiple L twos calculating the the base fees for these l, 2 s.

168
00:28:02.130 --> 00:28:09.990
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Sometimes different depending on what the L 2 uses. If it's using blobs, if it's using.

169
00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:20.450
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: So the because the costs on the l 1 varies, it's not just about a congestion cost anymore. It's more

170
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.379
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: related to

171
00:28:23.350 --> 00:28:45.599
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: directly injecting the costs of posting the blobs of of verification, proofs of these L 2 blocks on chain, etcetera. All of this counts in as part of the cost. Now, most of networks. What they do is that they

172
00:28:45.810 --> 00:28:53.350
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: they sometimes tend to subsidize these costs, and that's fine. But

173
00:28:53.550 --> 00:29:17.890
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: at at 1 point, when we're trying to work on on L. 2 l. Two's l. 2 transaction fees, we found ourselves in need to tell the wallet what the base fee and the priority fee should potentially be. Especially the base fee right? The priority fee will probably more be needed

174
00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:47.440
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: for pre-confirmations in the future. But the base fee which will should basically cover part partially, some of the l. 1 posting and verification cost. It's a little bit tough, and some of the wallets actually call internal Apis public Apis that they have, like some and those Apis do some

175
00:29:47.620 --> 00:30:01.851
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: unknown calculation on how to get the fees. So we noticed, for example, that in Metamask Metamask actually calls an internal Api

176
00:30:03.131 --> 00:30:06.778
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: that that does that returns this data.

177
00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:22.159
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: rainbow actually calls an internal Api also. But then this internal ap we noticed that in rainbow. This internal Api then calls the Rpc. To get the data from it. So

178
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:51.291
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: if your Rpc. Is a local machine, it won't work. But if it's a public IP address, it will work because it's it is accessible. By the by, the like internal Api service that rainbow is calling for Rabi. That's not the case. Rabi, directly, for example, calls the Rpc. Endpoint and and gets the data from it. So my sorry for the long explanation. But

179
00:30:51.850 --> 00:31:00.900
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: my, my idea here is that I want to discuss. Why is there no like standard for for how this is done? And how can we make it

180
00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:11.010
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: become a standard and how we can reach a good implementation for this.

181
00:31:29.610 --> 00:31:32.739
Sam: So I think this is definitely an important issue to raise.

182
00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:45.160
Sam: I'm not sure if we're going to get much like synchronous feedback today, if somebody wants to talk, feel free to interrupt me. But it might be better to post like a summary in the Discord channel, and we can maybe start an Async discussion about it.

183
00:31:45.758 --> 00:31:48.170
Sam: That tends to get a little bit more response.

184
00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.469
Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind: Sure we'll do that. Thank you.

185
00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:04.819
Sam: Cool. Does anybody have anything else they want to talk about today? Otherwise we can wrap it up

186
00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:15.449
Sam: great. Well, we'll see you all next month. Talk to you, then.
