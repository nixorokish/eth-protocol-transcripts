00:29:02	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Mildly related, it seems that sign in with Ethereum (4361) opted out of 712 a while back
00:29:19	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Which is a setback for such ercs that are building on top of 712

00:31:40	Adam Fuller:	Replying to "Mildly related, it s..."

is that the case? eip still seems to reference 712
00:32:44	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Yea you can use this for one signature for multiple chains, kinda like supertransactions
00:32:53	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Doesn‚Äôt have to be messages only (1271, 6492)

It only mentions it as to why it‚Äôs not used
00:33:41	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Replying to "Mildly related, it s‚Ä¶"
‚ÄúWhy ERC-191 (Signed Data Standard) over EIP-712 (Ethereum typed structured data hashing and signing)‚Äù

00:36:02	Adam Fuller:	this makes sense to me!
00:36:17	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Fully makes sense, we‚Äôve ran into issues with this with complex bridges
00:36:38	Sola:	Reacted to "Yea you can use this..." with üëç
00:37:30	Adam Fuller:	makes sense!
00:37:37	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Yea top level gas includes a lot other components, like contract overhead, whether it uses 7702 etc etc
00:37:44	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Sometimes there‚Äôs account deployment too
00:40:16	Sam Wilson:	I  guess the user can always set whatever limit too, right?

00:51:38	Ivo Georgiev | Ambire:	Maybe I‚Äôll open a thread about it on magicians
