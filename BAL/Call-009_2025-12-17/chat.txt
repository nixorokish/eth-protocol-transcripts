00:28:36	Stefan Starflinger:	Since clients are much more stable now we could start devnet-1 either before the holiday or straight after
00:29:59	Stefan Starflinger:	Still need bal-devnet-1 branch from erigon :)
00:30:43	Stefan Starflinger:	I can add erigon as soon as you are ready
00:30:43	Karim T. (matkt):	It will be nice if we can wait some days, we should have CALL fix soon
00:37:29	draganrakita:	This is good test vector to see if reading from BALs write list is correct
00:37:57	jochem-brouwer:	Antwoord verzenden naar "This is good test ..."

Exactly, the benchmark tests are "testing" to see if the parallel execution is implemented correctly :)

00:38:23	Karim T. (matkt):	Could be also in the testnet having the two nodes configuration with and without // running at the same time

Oh this is a very good point :D

00:42:10	Barnabas:	ship something now and that should be the next devnet’s scope
00:42:20	Karim T. (matkt):	Before Holliday ? I don’t think it will be possible
00:42:22	Barnabas:	imo
