00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:33.650
Toni Wahrstaetter: Hello?

2
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.110
Pooja Ranjan: Hey, Tony, good morning.

3
00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:02.579
Pooja Ranjan: I'm going to start pre-streaming in a few seconds, and just let me know whenever we are ready to move over the stream.

4
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.609
Toni Wahrstaetter: Sounds good, thank you.

5
00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:06.160
Toni Wahrstaetter: Hello, everyone. Let's wait.

6
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:09.630
Toni Wahrstaetter: One or two more minutes for people to join.

7
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:34.880
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect, I think we're ready to go.

8
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:37.769
Pooja Ranjan: We are live.

9
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.929
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, thank you.

10
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:50.740
Toni Wahrstaetter: Welcome, everyone! Today we have the fifth EIP7928 breakout call. It's the 22nd October 2025.

11
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:54.330
Toni Wahrstaetter: And we have 3 agenda items today.

12
00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:07.190
Toni Wahrstaetter: First of all, we wanted to talk about Coinbase handling. This came up in Discord, and also, there were some suggestions that we change how we view the Coinbase address at the moment.

13
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:18.300
Toni Wahrstaetter: Then second, as usual, we did some, testing and specs updates. There were some updates that we can discuss today. And finally, client updates.

14
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:25.059
Toni Wahrstaetter: So let's directly start into the… start with the first agenda item.

15
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.760
Toni Wahrstaetter: which is the Coinbase handling in the BlockClam Exorcist.

16
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:38.220
Toni Wahrstaetter: To give you a quick recap how it works right now, so the Coinbase address is only included in the Block Live access list.

17
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:40.519
Toni Wahrstaetter: If it actually changes.

18
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:45.230
Toni Wahrstaetter: This means, if there is any transaction, that…

19
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:53.349
Toni Wahrstaetter: has a positive tip, then the Coinbase will see a balance change.

20
00:10:53.450 --> 00:11:06.649
Toni Wahrstaetter: The same applies, if the Coinbase address receives a withdrawal. So in this case, even blocks without any transactions can still have a block lab access list with the Coinbase address included.

21
00:11:07.350 --> 00:11:10.130
Toni Wahrstaetter: In case the companies receive the withdrawal.

22
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.440
Toni Wahrstaetter: And…

23
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:22.299
Toni Wahrstaetter: For any other, so if there is a block with where the Coinbase address receives no withdrawal, and there is no transaction, then the Coinbase address is not included at all.

24
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.760
Toni Wahrstaetter: So this is what is spec'd right now, and also the state of the EIP.

25
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:31.759
Toni Wahrstaetter: And I'm happy to discuss if we should change that.

26
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:34.830
Toni Wahrstaetter: Or, if we keep it as is.

27
00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:48.640
draganrakita: Did you maybe mention the use case when there is transaction, but the fee reward is zero?

28
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:53.550
draganrakita: what happened for codebase in that case?

29
00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.150
Toni Wahrstaetter: In this case, it would also not be included.

30
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:15.080
Toni Wahrstaetter: But this is a good example, yeah. So, if the fee reward is zero, then we would not see a call to the Coinbase address, and the Coinbase address would not be included. So, a zero…

31
00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:21.339
Toni Wahrstaetter: Value reward is, in this case, different than a zero value call.

32
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.450
Toni Wahrstaetter: Because in a zero-value call.

33
00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:30.250
Toni Wahrstaetter: The address you're calling would still be included, at least as a read, so with all empty changes.

34
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:33.579
Toni Wahrstaetter: But for the reward, it would not be included at all.

35
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:40.890
draganrakita: This kinda clashes with the state clear IP.

36
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.100
draganrakita: Where even we have some tests in East that test this use case.

37
00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:54.759
draganrakita: When the Coinbase is basically empty but existing, and you reward it at the end.

38
00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:04.060
draganrakita: Expectation there is that, the Coinbase is going to be touched, at the end, removed from the…

39
00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:06.880
draganrakita: from the state.

40
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:19.839
Toni Wahrstaetter: I see the conveys is going to be touched, and is it always empty in this case, the conveys? Is it only touched if it's empty? Or is it always touched in that scenario?

41
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:27.840
draganrakita: It's always touched, but only action that needs to be… needs to happen is if it is empty.

42
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:30.050
draganrakita: That means it needs to be removed.

43
00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:32.130
draganrakita: From the state.

44
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:46.220
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, so previously, I think I was pro… I was pro, to not include the…

45
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:56.950
Jared Wasinger: Coinbase as a read if the balance doesn't change, like, in the case of the empty block or the zero fee payment, but I…

46
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.210
Jared Wasinger: think…

47
00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:12.049
Jared Wasinger: now that the point about… I think it's… I forget what the state straight clearing EIP… so the point about it being touched as part of the… I think it might be EIP161, I can't quite…

48
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.350
Jared Wasinger: remember right now, but I think that…

49
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:33.770
Jared Wasinger: perhaps that's actually, like, I mean, a fairly decent argument to actually just include the Coinbase, and as… and furthermore, just include anything that would be touched as part of EIP161 as a read.

50
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:40.809
draganrakita: I would do something in the middle.

51
00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:51.659
draganrakita: If the empty fee is transferred to Coinbase, hey, let's include Coinbase, it is the same behavior as you're transferring the zero value to any other account.

52
00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.040
draganrakita: But… I've… if… If there is no trace section.

53
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:02.770
draganrakita: then I would not include Coinbase.

54
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:10.189
draganrakita: But that second part is not… I'm not going to die on that, to be honest.

55
00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:17.450
draganrakita: We can, yeah… we can always add some edge case where we always add the Coinbase.

56
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:28.230
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, to me… to me, this… this feels like the cleanest solution to this, because now I can definitely see the argument for including the Coinbase in

57
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:34.709
Toni Wahrstaetter: this exact edge case that you described with this, three-digit ERP that we're talking about.

58
00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:41.319
Toni Wahrstaetter: It also, just to echo what Rahu is saying there in the chat, it will also,

59
00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:58.819
Toni Wahrstaetter: allow us to treat a zero-value call exactly the same as a zero-value balance. So, essentially, we would just have a rule in the ERP that the Coinbase address is always included, at least as a read, if there is no other changes happening to the Coinbase account.

60
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.740
Toni Wahrstaetter: And then we don't have to think about any of those edge cases.

61
00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:27.800
Toni Wahrstaetter: I'm curious what other clients think about this. This is definitely a small change to the specs, and also some changes to the AOP required.

62
00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:33.610
Toni Wahrstaetter: I guess we will also have to, change the tests we have on that topic.

63
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:39.669
Toni Wahrstaetter: All small changes, I'm happy to do so, but let's see what other clients think about it.

64
00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:52.260
Marc: I think it makes sense to include it. It just seems a bit more consistent, and we don't have this, specific edge case.

65
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.969
Toni Wahrstaetter: just, just for Lucas, Lucas to quickly,

66
00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:10.930
Toni Wahrstaetter: summarize the discussions about the Coinbase address, how it is included in the block lab access list.

67
00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:13.049
Toni Wahrstaetter: We are now landing…

68
00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:22.599
Toni Wahrstaetter: at including the Coinbase address, no matter what. So the Coinbase address will always be in the block lab access list, and the least

69
00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:35.909
Toni Wahrstaetter: it would be in there with empty changes. So there can be balance changes, a Coinbase address can also have nonce changes or code changes, but it will always be in there at least as a read, as a state access.

70
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.909
Toni Wahrstaetter: Because previously, there was the situation that A block with no transactions?

71
00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:53.529
Toni Wahrstaetter: The question popped up, should the Coinbase address be included or not, and what happens if the block reward is zero versus non-zero? So the easiest solution seems like we

72
00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:01.130
Toni Wahrstaetter: have a new edge case for the Coinbase, which says the Coinbase address is always included in the block lab access list, no matter what.

73
00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:20.130
raxhvl: I'm always including Coinbase as One problem, because… It introduces redundancy.

74
00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.449
raxhvl: We could always get the Coinbase from the block anyways.

75
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:31.700
Toni Wahrstaetter: Right, yeah, it's a bit of, duplicated information there.

76
00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:48.200
Toni Wahrstaetter: But I think it's fine, because it's only, like, a very rare edge case. This edge case only occurs if we have a block where the Coinbase address wouldn't be included anyway. And usually, blocks have transactions with positive tips.

77
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.049
Toni Wahrstaetter: So, I think we can live with it.

78
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:13.270
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, then just to summarize the to-dos, I will update the specs and the EAP. Rahul, will you update the test cases?

79
00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:16.510
raxhvl: Yep.

80
00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:25.259
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect Is there… maybe asking Felipe, is there anything else,

81
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:28.620
Toni Wahrstaetter: That you might be thinking of that we have to change here?

82
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.520
Toni Wahrstaetter: I guess not, right?

83
00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:38.539
felipe: No, I think the… Yeah, the yield side, the spec side needs to change,

84
00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.540
felipe: But yeah, I'm good with this change.

85
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.959
felipe: Makes sense to me.

86
00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:44.650
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, perfect.

87
00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:48.269
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, then let's move forward with that. Yeah, please go ahead.

88
00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:53.930
draganrakita: Just… just to confirm, so always include it, even if there is no transactions.

89
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:55.949
Toni Wahrstaetter: Right, yeah.

90
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:59.619
draganrakita: Can have a very, probably in the specs, we will…

91
00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:07.729
Toni Wahrstaetter: it will even simplify the specs a bit, because we will just have one line at the very beginning of the block, where we put the Coinbase address in there.

92
00:20:14.570 --> 00:20:17.370
Marc: I mean, an alternative would be…

93
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:21.189
Marc: to just have it only if there was, I guess, just one…

94
00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.409
Marc: Transaction with… with a… with a zero balance change.

95
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:32.059
Marc: I don't know, because always including it seems like almost adding another

96
00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:38.729
Marc: Edge case, whereas if we just have it so that whenever there's a zero transfer, then that's just, you know, always handled the same.

97
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.120
Marc: That seems the simplest to me, but I mean, it's a small difference.

98
00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:44.360
draganrakita: Same hero.

99
00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:46.820
draganrakita: Aware of what Mark said.

100
00:20:47.010 --> 00:20:53.120
draganrakita: It simpler… if included always, then we have some additional condition that we need to add.

101
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:59.690
draganrakita: If included, only if there is transaction, even if… even if the fee…

102
00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:04.359
draganrakita: Value is 0, then we just use what's salted there.

103
00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.890
draganrakita: It's small change, it doesn't matter, we can always have, like, additional condition, but just wanted to point that up.

104
00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:18.630
Toni Wahrstaetter: I'm fine with this one, too. So then the edge case would be we include the Coinbase address.

105
00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.029
Toni Wahrstaetter: Even if the reward is zero.

106
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:25.230
draganrakita: Yep.

107
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:31.489
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, yeah, curious to hear what others think about this. I'm fine with that one, too.

108
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.740
raxhvl: I think it's cleaner.

109
00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:50.279
raxhvl: This way, this is like any other balance change for an account.

110
00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:06.199
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, so as far as implementing it in Geth, I think regardless of whether it's always include or, include as long as there's a,

111
00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:24.900
Jared Wasinger: a transaction in the block that, even if it pays zero fees, it's still a bit of a special case, and I think what's important from my perspective is that we just settle, so, I don't have a strong opinion either way.

112
00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:40.110
Toni Wahrstaetter: Just to confirm, the… if there is no transaction in a block, the Coinbase will be included, and if there is a transaction in a block with a zero tip, the Coinbase will also be included, right?

113
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:48.399
Jared Wasinger: I think that was the always include option, but my understanding of what

114
00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:53.249
Jared Wasinger: maybe I misheard, but I think what Mark and Dragon just said was to…

115
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:57.930
Jared Wasinger: If that there is an empty block to not include the Coinbase.

116
00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:04.829
Jared Wasinger: And if there is a block containing one or more transactions, even if they pay zero fees.

117
00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:08.270
Jared Wasinger: to include the Coinbase, that's the other option.

118
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.110
draganrakita: Yeah, that's one.

119
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:26.899
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, interesting, because I was thinking, like, okay, isn't it, like, from the Coinbase perspective, the same if I receive zero reward through a block with no transactions versus zero reward through a block with one transaction paying zero tips?

120
00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:28.410
Jared Wasinger: Is there, is there some…

121
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.030
Toni Wahrstaetter: Good, dude.

122
00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:44.689
Jared Wasinger: The distinction that Dragon pointed out earlier is that from the EIP for the state clearing, the… in the case where there is the zero fee transaction, the Coinbase is actually touched.

123
00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:54.470
Jared Wasinger: And in the… because we no longer pay the block rewards at… the…

124
00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:06.450
Jared Wasinger: the… in the other case, the Coinbase would not be touched in an empty block without Any transactions?

125
00:24:06.650 --> 00:24:07.850
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, gotcha.

126
00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:10.100
Jared Wasinger: I don't know, just maybe…

127
00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:11.069
Toni Wahrstaetter: I think you got it, yeah.

128
00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:13.459
Jared Wasinger: Someone else can expand on it for me.

129
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:24.319
Toni Wahrstaetter: No, this is interesting, because it's then actually the tip paying that touches the Coinbase and not the reward, right?

130
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:35.449
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, makes sense, because there is no, block reward. So, okay, because I'm just thinking in the specs, we might have already

131
00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:41.560
Toni Wahrstaetter: We might do that already correctly, but I would have to double-check, because Yeah.

132
00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.540
Toni Wahrstaetter: But… Are we then fine with,

133
00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.989
Toni Wahrstaetter: Agreeing on that solution that we…

134
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:55.529
Toni Wahrstaetter: So, just to summarize, the Coinbase would then be included in case there is a transaction.

135
00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:09.800
Toni Wahrstaetter: Even though the transaction has a zero tip. So if the transaction has a positive tip, the transaction… the Coinbase is included anyway, because it has a balance change. But if the transaction has a zero tip.

136
00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:15.019
Toni Wahrstaetter: then the Coinbase would at least be included as a state access, as a read.

137
00:25:20.940 --> 00:25:21.690
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great.

138
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:26.359
Toni Wahrstaetter: And the only situation where the Coinbase address would not be included

139
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:30.559
Toni Wahrstaetter: Would then be a block with no transactions, is that correct, too?

140
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:54.679
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, yeah. Rahul is also confirming me in the chat, so the Coinbase address would not be included in the block access list in case if there is no transactions, and…

141
00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:59.670
Toni Wahrstaetter: No system operations touching the Coinbase, which could happen with a withdrawal.

142
00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.080
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect.

143
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:08.410
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, then let's update the EAP, the specs and the tests, and…

144
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:12.579
Toni Wahrstaetter: Make sure we have it ready for the next, release.

145
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:14.420
Toni Wahrstaetter: Awesome.

146
00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:24.240
Toni Wahrstaetter: Then we can… is there… before we move on to the second point, is there anything else people want to discuss regarding the Coinbase address tracking?

147
00:26:24.790 --> 00:26:29.229
Karim T.: Monique, could you just summarize again, just to be sure I follow everything?

148
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:40.299
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, so the Coinbase, will be included if it sees a balance change, for example. So if there is any change in the block.

149
00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:51.259
Toni Wahrstaetter: But regarding the Coinbase, then it's included no matter what, so there's no edge case around that. For example, if the Coinbase receives a tip from a transaction, then it's included with the balance change.

150
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:57.369
Toni Wahrstaetter: The interesting case is what happens if the block is empty, so there is no transaction in the block.

151
00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.830
Toni Wahrstaetter: In this case, the Coinbase is… Not touched.

152
00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:05.749
Toni Wahrstaetter: The Coinbase would also not be included.

153
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:07.910
Toni Wahrstaetter: So, zero transactions.

154
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:18.150
Toni Wahrstaetter: could mean the Coinbase is not included in the bulk. It could also mean the Coinbase is still included in the block of access list, but only if it receives a withdrawal.

155
00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.870
Toni Wahrstaetter: And then…

156
00:27:21.130 --> 00:27:29.859
Toni Wahrstaetter: Another second interesting case was, what if there is a transaction in the block, but it pays zero tip to the Coinbase?

157
00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.500
Toni Wahrstaetter: In this case, we agreed that we include the…

158
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:38.489
Toni Wahrstaetter: Coinbase address into the block access list. So…

159
00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:49.099
Toni Wahrstaetter: In both examples, when there is no transaction, and when there is one transaction that pays nothing as a tip, in both transactions, the Coinbase address receives nothing.

160
00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:52.969
Toni Wahrstaetter: But in the first case, where there is no transaction.

161
00:27:53.570 --> 00:28:03.399
Toni Wahrstaetter: the Coinbase is not actually touched, and that's why we don't include it. In the second case, when there is a transaction, then the Coinbase is touched, and we include it.

162
00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:08.240
Karim T.: Just explain.

163
00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:19.329
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect. Is there anything else, regarding the Coinbase tracking before we move on?

164
00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:36.379
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great. Then the next point on the agenda would be testing and specs update.

165
00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:44.040
Toni Wahrstaetter: I would ask Rahul or Felipe, is there… are there any updates from your side, regarding testing and…

166
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:46.399
Toni Wahrstaetter: Test releases.

167
00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:59.849
raxhvl: Yeah, so clients are passing almost all test cases, the positive ones, so we're about 90… 89% of

168
00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:06.600
raxhvl: test cases that we're currently passing. The remaining 10 test cases has mostly to do with

169
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:12.350
raxhvl: incorrect pal payloads, and I believe the clients are also passing those.

170
00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:16.640
raxhvl: But we're missing some exceptions within each framework.

171
00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:23.440
raxhvl: So, yeah, so we'll get that in probably… Late this week.

172
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:31.229
raxhvl: And I think we should be good to go in terms of the current release. We're also working on a new release.

173
00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:35.229
raxhvl: For the tests that we discussed this past week.

174
00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:41.140
raxhvl: That includes, the Coinbase, updates, and…

175
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.039
raxhvl: Some system operations, so we still don't have a new install, so…

176
00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.279
Toni Wahrstaetter: Awesome, thank you very much.

177
00:29:53.290 --> 00:29:58.180
Toni Wahrstaetter: Is there any updates, worth sharing from the first step that we had?

178
00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.970
Toni Wahrstaetter: Maybe from clients, or…

179
00:30:00.290 --> 00:30:01.540
Toni Wahrstaetter: From people involved?

180
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:09.780
Stefan Starflinger: I mean, the definite is still being set up, if that's what you mean. It's not running yet.

181
00:30:11.390 --> 00:30:12.930
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, all good.

182
00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:18.399
Toni Wahrstaetter: I saw, SSU right then, Nicole Steffen.

183
00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:27.850
Toni Wahrstaetter: I think you and PK, you were also working on, improving DORA, right? Because I had, like, a very naive DORA implementation at the beginning.

184
00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.590
Toni Wahrstaetter: And… Are there any updates? Any… anything you can already share?

185
00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.869
Stefan Starflinger: Maybe Pike wants to update on the Bora?

186
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.610
pk910: Yep,

187
00:30:41.370 --> 00:30:55.539
pk910: Well, basically, we have, accessless visualization in DORA. I've reworked at you a bit to be more performant, so it's client-side rendered, and it's also able to render really big lists if needed.

188
00:30:56.110 --> 00:31:12.259
pk910: Another thing that's also added is a comparison feature, so you can post another BL and compare it to the one that is inside the block. So you can see diffs directly and, yeah, act on these.

189
00:31:12.430 --> 00:31:22.159
pk910: If there's anything that's needed, or any improvement suggestions, please reach out to me. I'm happy to add them as well.

190
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.030
Toni Wahrstaetter: Amazing, thank you very much. This is great, especially the DivView.

191
00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:33.550
Toni Wahrstaetter: I can… I can see that this will be very handy in the future.

192
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.750
Toni Wahrstaetter: Thanks a lot for that.

193
00:31:39.170 --> 00:31:43.759
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, then, let's move on to the last agenda item of today.

194
00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:46.219
Toni Wahrstaetter: As usual, the client updates.

195
00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.490
Toni Wahrstaetter: Maybe we can start with Jared.

196
00:31:51.370 --> 00:32:06.390
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, so basically the update on the GIF side is that we have been incrementally merging various parts of the access list changes into the codebase,

197
00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:15.310
Jared Wasinger: there's still… Quite a ways to go on that front, but, we're working on it,

198
00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:19.259
Jared Wasinger: I think now the focus is…

199
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:28.819
Jared Wasinger: While that is happening, also the focus from my end is on the development side is shifting back to, trying to

200
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:40.419
Jared Wasinger: Optimize the performance on our side, specifically focused on the performance of the state route calculation.

201
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:45.660
Jared Wasinger: So… Yeah,

202
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:51.539
Jared Wasinger: I hope to have more to share on that soon, but it's in progress at the moment.

203
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.040
Jared Wasinger: Yeah, that's it.

204
00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:06.310
Toni Wahrstaetter: Awesome, thanks a lot, and yeah, would be great, if you can share some results in the call as soon as you got them. Sounds… sounds exciting.

205
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.500
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect, then let's continue with Bisu.

206
00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:20.680
Karim T.: On the basel side, we are now passing all the… all of the RLP tests, and also enzyme tests.

207
00:33:20.810 --> 00:33:27.340
Karim T.: So we just need to merge the PR that Margie made to update the execution spec test.

208
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:33.480
Karim T.: repo mapping. So we also started to implement the state root in background.

209
00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:37.519
Karim T.: At the beginning of the block processing, thanks to Block Access List.

210
00:33:37.650 --> 00:33:54.069
Karim T.: So, it's already working, but for the moment, just, we are logging the result of the statehood computation to compare. But in another PR, we will verify the state root and fail the block if it's not matching. But for the moment, just want to compare if it's working or not.

211
00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:00.669
Karim T.: What we want to do also in the next step is to do a shadow fork of mainnet.

212
00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:08.329
Karim T.: And like that, we'll be able to measure the impact of the state routine background regarding performance on Bezoo.

213
00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.599
Karim T.: So, it would be nice if we can do that.

214
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:19.549
Karim T.: And we are also working and trying to fix the parallelization of execution of transaction with block access list.

215
00:34:23.050 --> 00:34:24.719
Toni Wahrstaetter: Awesome, thank you very much.

216
00:34:25.850 --> 00:34:28.159
Toni Wahrstaetter: Let's continue with Nethermind.

217
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:48.030
Marc: It, so made quite a bit of progress with the, bowel construction. I've been testing out Interop with, Bessieu and Geth, and, now it's able to get quite a bit past the, Glow Asph walk.

218
00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.670
Marc: But there are still some, like, consensus issues after, a few epochs.

219
00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:55.690
Marc: So I'm having a look into that.

220
00:34:55.810 --> 00:35:04.149
Marc: But I've also just found quite a few, kind of consensus issues that were there, even though 100% of the tests were,

221
00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:11.450
Marc: were passing, so I'm gonna speak a bit to make some regression tests for everything I found.

222
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.150
Marc: Awesome.

223
00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:18.440
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, thanks a lot, and great, great inputs there.

224
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.860
Toni Wahrstaetter: This… this seems like we… we haven't covered anything.

225
00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:28.149
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yet, everything yet in the tests, and definitely some… some more things to do here.

226
00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:33.269
Toni Wahrstaetter: Thanks a lot for that let's continue with ref.

227
00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:58.950
Ishika: Hello, so for it, the tests were passing. As of now, we were moving from integrations of our branch to that of Dragon's branch, which I believe will be more architecture-friendly, concerning it will be less dependent on the Alloy VM. The majority of the parts are integrated, but there are certain things I would like to take care of.

228
00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:08.560
Ishika: So that's something we are doing, but overall, it's alright, and possibly I will be… the error we are having as of now, I will possibly fix it by the end of the day.

229
00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.040
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, thanks a lot for this update.

230
00:36:14.180 --> 00:36:16.060
Toni Wahrstaetter: Sounds… sounds very good.

231
00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.249
Toni Wahrstaetter: And finally, Aragon.

232
00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:27.630
Mark Holt: Yeah, hi. So, where we are, we've just, I think, yesterday, merged

233
00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:40.680
Mark Holt: our first PR, which is the basic support for bowels into Maine. There's a couple more PRs to go, which hopefully will happen over the next couple of days, so…

234
00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:44.689
Mark Holt: I think we should have a DevNet Zero

235
00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.309
Mark Holt: branch that we create, probably tomorrow or Friday.

236
00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:53.500
Mark Holt: And then after that, we're kind of…

237
00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:56.440
Mark Holt: We'll do some testing and see where we are.

238
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:01.539
Mark Holt: I would say we're about a week behind where I thought we were.

239
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:11.210
Mark Holt: on the last call, just because, we've got sidetracked with Fusaka issues, which kind of took priority.

240
00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:19.329
Mark Holt: But we're basically back on block-level access lists as a, you know, as our primary focus now.

241
00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:23.369
Toni Wahrstaetter: Sounds good, thanks a lot.

242
00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:31.589
Toni Wahrstaetter: And let me know, or reach out to me, Rahul, Felipe, if you… if you need any help with getting integrated into the tests and everything.

243
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:40.749
Mark Holt: Yeah, yeah, so we'll do that, but I think we'll probably either be working on that Friday or early next week, just to set your expectations of…

244
00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.179
Mark Holt: But I'm sure we'll start breaking stuff.

245
00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.860
Mark Holt: As soon as we try.

246
00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.220
Toni Wahrstaetter: Sounds good. Thank you very much.

247
00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:57.909
Toni Wahrstaetter: Great, then this was the last agenda item we had on today's call. Is there anything else people want to bring up?

248
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:14.140
Stefan Starflinger: I just wanted to summarize regarding the definites a little bit more, that I've been finding a lot of issues working together with different client teams that I've been holding off, kind of, progressing and getting that live, but I think

249
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:30.679
Stefan Starflinger: By the end of the week, I think we might be ready. I'm still… need to fix something with the consensus Layer clients that loads are in Prism, interop. There was something that I'm still looking into, and I hope that with Nevermind, it will also

250
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.469
Stefan Starflinger: be working better, and then we can start the definite, I think, definite zero.

251
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:42.470
Karim T.: Do we want to have the Coinbase modifications for the next DevNets?

252
00:38:43.780 --> 00:38:46.950
Karim T.: Because I think we'll have to do some modification in Bezoop.

253
00:38:50.050 --> 00:39:02.070
Stefan Starflinger: That's a good question. I think maybe, Tony, that's something we could find out before we start, if we want to do a wait and have that modification in or not.

254
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:10.999
Toni Wahrstaetter: Okay, Jared and Dragon are saying they want to, have it already?

255
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:17.159
Toni Wahrstaetter: I'm happy to… to go for it, but it's more of a question for clients, I guess.

256
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:22.169
Karim T.: I think it would be okay if we have some tests, just to be sure.

257
00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.330
Karim T.: We are working correctly.

258
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:26.570
Karim T.: Okay, thanks.

259
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.699
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect, yeah, just to echo what Rahul is saying in the chat.

260
00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:44.510
Toni Wahrstaetter: That, he's working on tests, this week, so that we have, those individual tests. I think we need a test for an empty block, then a block with one transaction, paying no tips.

261
00:39:44.690 --> 00:39:48.440
Toni Wahrstaetter: And the regular block, and then we should have everything covered there.

262
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:52.020
Toni Wahrstaetter: But then let's agree that in the first FNAT,

263
00:39:52.510 --> 00:40:00.840
Toni Wahrstaetter: End of week, next week, that we, already include those most recent changes regarding the Coinbase tracking.

264
00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.020
Stefan Starflinger: Sounds good, then I'll wait for that.

265
00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.440
Toni Wahrstaetter: Perfect. Is there anything else we should discuss today?

266
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:34.220
Toni Wahrstaetter: If not… We can end the call at this point, we can end a little bit earlier, and…

267
00:40:35.110 --> 00:40:42.029
Toni Wahrstaetter: Yeah, see everyone in the next, 7, 9, 28 breakout call in 2 weeks. Thanks a lot.

268
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:44.600
draganrakita: Bye.

269
00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:45.484
Jared Wasinger: Oh.

270
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:46.500
Mark Holt: Bye.

271
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:47.140
Karim T.: Alright.

272
00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.610
Ishika: Bye.
