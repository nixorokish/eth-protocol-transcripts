00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.730
nixo: Hi, Mercy.

2
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:14.860
nixo: Morning.

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.320
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello, good evening.

4
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.880
nixo: I'm gonna make you host.

5
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.070
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you.

6
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.710
nixo: And now I'm taking back off.

7
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.210
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello?

8
00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.010
Chase Wright: Hello.

9
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.010
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hi, hello.

10
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.659
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We just have to, like, wait about the next two minutes, then we can start. If no one joins, then…

11
00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.130
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Let me send a message on the group chat.

12
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.680
Chase Wright: I know the all-core dev testing call was canceled, so… Maybe people.

13
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.160
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

14
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.010
Chase Wright: canceled, too.

15
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.479
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I asked during our last call, and everybody supported it, so…

16
00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.699
Chase Wright: Yes, there's no problem.

17
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.519
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Let me just start. If they won't be able to join, it's fine also.

18
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:44.670
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hey, Zane.

19
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.910
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Hey, how's it going?

20
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.090
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Fine, welcome.

21
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:50.380
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Oh, thanks, thanks.

22
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:57.909
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think we can start. I'm not sure if others are joining, because it's probably,

23
00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.679
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Holiday season, so we'll understand that.

24
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.460
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Although we don't have any much on the agenda, so good afternoon, everybody. Welcome to… ROPC Standard call.

25
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: 17.

26
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:21.470
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, on agenda, we have… wanted us to discuss about renaming the SRO, codes categories.

27
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.790
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Well, I don't think… seems to be joining us today.

28
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:32.160
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: That brings us using. You did mention about…

29
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.230
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: adding this to the agenda, so I don't even know what it's about.

30
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.899
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: About the… what? Did you repeat that? It was the last…

31
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:45.250
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I was saying…

32
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:54.420
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sims is not here, because we wanted to talk about the error codes, but since Sims is not here, we can move over to your own agenda, what you dropped on the agenda for today.

33
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:59.629
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Oh, yeah, sure. Do you mind if I, like, share a screen and just… Yeah, no problem.

34
00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:00.630
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

35
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.600
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Doo-do-do… Let's do…

36
00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.260
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Hey, let me switch this around…

37
00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:23.659
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Let's go here…

38
00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.079
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So… Sims is here!

39
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.199
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Hey, guys.

40
00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.770
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And… That, and open up one more tab, and then we'll be on our way.

41
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.990
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Fusion APIs… Yeah.

42
00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.270
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: We'll look at the issue first.

43
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.880
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Alright, so…

44
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:22.759
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: The OpenRPC team has been, sort of just overhauling the Execution APIs, repository, so just kind of taking in all the feedback over the past couple years, not even years, but, like, recently in the past couple of months, like, moved from Gatsby.

45
00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.340
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: the Docuosaurus, back to Gadsby.

46
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:31.840
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Now back to Docuosaurus, but in a much more sustainable and, like, generic way.

47
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.500
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So… I found this issue, which just talks about the overall improved, DevEx.

48
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:52.150
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, things to note, it's a standardized DocuSource build, so all the stuff that you use for DocuSource, you could use here. There's minimal configuration, with the DocuSource plugin.

49
00:07:52.210 --> 00:08:08.900
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: There's in-repo documentation for, like, dev visibility, so the docs, when they're rendered, will go to, like, a sort of rendered page on disk, so that way, like, let's say there's typos, or let's say that there's a part of…

50
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:15.670
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Some method that's marked down, that's not being rendered properly, you can, like, pretty easily address that.

51
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:24.819
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: There's searchable documentation now, so you can search for keywords and things like that, or just, like, your regular docs.

52
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:33.719
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And then it supports, Sims's Air Group extension as well. It also adds support for the X category stuff.

53
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.950
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: There's taggable methods, so you can tag things that belong to a fork or a particular group, so…

54
00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.610
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: I think we have things, like, split up between, like, execution, etc.

55
00:08:46.030 --> 00:09:05.969
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And that becomes a little, like, tagable thing, so either on the page you can click on it, or on the index, which you'll see, shortly, that works. You can copy as markdown functionality for each page, and then, it's improved live development and speed. It's just much faster.

56
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.770
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So I put together a quick demo page, which is this, which is, like, the new site.

57
00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:23.180
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: As you can see… One of the big things, was talking about, Having the,

58
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:32.780
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: docs and the methods in the side. So if we go here… To… And these,

59
00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:34.770
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Eve chain ID?

60
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:43.820
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: We'll see that we have, Eve's chain ID. It tells us, like, what the results are. We have a nice little example.

61
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.179
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And then we can, like, send requests live?

62
00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:50.949
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And then you can also copy as curl or fetch.

63
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:59.050
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Which makes things, like, way easier, to just copy as curl, and then pop it into a browser, and then…

64
00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:02.139
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Or your terminal, and then make the request.

65
00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:07.980
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: There's search, so if I look for, bug.

66
00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:15.390
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: This… It can take you to any of the documents as well.

67
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:28.229
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, under guides is where I moved all of the docs that we have currently, but this could easily expand in the sidebar. I think there's, like, a bunch of engine stuff,

68
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:37.650
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: that is often in Markdown, that are engine specifications, so we can always, like, add more subcategories underneath, or someone can.

69
00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:42.179
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And then this can be styled however, anyone likes.

70
00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:47.290
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And that's pretty much so, it.

71
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.130
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah.

72
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.300
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, I just have, like, the… Oh, okay, you're clear.

73
00:10:55.450 --> 00:11:00.079
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Are we back to the CSRS for good, or we are still going back to Gatsby?

74
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:19.600
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: No, this is, DocuSaurus for good. Backing this is a more generic, Markdown generator, so if EF feels like DocuSource isn't working for them, they want to use Nextra or README docs, this will translate all of the OpenRPC Markdown…

75
00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:33.949
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: all of the OpenRPC documents into either NDX, depending on what you want, or Markdown. This is also customizable, so if you're in an ecosystem where it's difficult to write a plugin.

76
00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:43.650
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: you can, instead of writing a plugin, you can specify a JSON, a JavaScript interface that will shim in

77
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.710
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Interactive components.

78
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:50.420
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, if you look at…

79
00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:54.229
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Let's say, get bad blocks, for instance.

80
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:58.920
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: This is, like, an interactive component, which is MDX.

81
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:03.820
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: But you can customize what this MDX does.

82
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:11.210
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Either through, like, changes to the DocuSource plugin, or you can do your own thing with a CLI.

83
00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:18.889
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, let's take a look at how this works. I can do it really quickly, and then I will…

84
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.720
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Seed the floor of The Sims, because I think he has, the bigger… Stuff to talk about.

85
00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:34.480
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Let's go here, and… 725…

86
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:44.980
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And… Let's see… you'll see here… maybe I'll go to two commits, it's easier to see.

87
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:49.749
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Because, again, documents… So, here's the one commit.

88
00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:51.810
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: This is… this…

89
00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.170
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Alright.

90
00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:04.799
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, commit changes… it still deploys on DocuSource,

91
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:11.260
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: There's the watch command stuff, which is slightly different, but that's, like, documented.

92
00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:18.080
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And the changes to make this work in the DocuSource config…

93
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:25.169
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: there is this. So here, you specify where the OpenRPZ document's gonna be.

94
00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:42.170
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Here you specify where you want to output the docs that are generated, and this index slug, allows for you to go directly to the documents, which was a complaint on other people's, like, systems as well, which is, like, when you go to the execution APIs.

95
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:51.669
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: It doesn't automatically, it wouldn't automatically route you to the reference documents, so now that, like, actually happens.

96
00:13:52.020 --> 00:13:53.450
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah.

97
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.850
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, that's, like, pretty much so the world, tour. Yeah.

98
00:14:01.180 --> 00:14:14.669
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, I don't know, but I think I did remember during, the refactoring before, the main reason for us trying to switch to Gatsby was because the gas storage wasn't maintained. Has that issue been solved? I don't know if I'm…

99
00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:21.590
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah, yeah, like, this is, like, the new thing, as in it is, like, fully maintained.

100
00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:24.950
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay. An update just happened…

101
00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:29.749
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Friday, it was, like, sort of completed end-to-end.

102
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.000
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: But yeah, as you can see, it's only 2 months old.

103
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:38.220
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay. Yeah.

104
00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.200
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah, that's, that's pretty much it.

105
00:14:44.410 --> 00:14:48.189
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Another question is,

106
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:56.180
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'm not sure how the… okay, Carrie is not here, because I can see the code file is, like, almost 36,000 to…

107
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.140
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: lines of code.

108
00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.210
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So…

109
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.830
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: I'm trying to figure out how…

110
00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:12.689
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Actually, so, the code change is split into two commits. So this is actually not, like, 82 files changed, it's just that you have to commit the docs.

111
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:20.810
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And so I split this into two PRs. So the actual change, if you were to look at this, is one…

112
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:26.710
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: A README, a getignore, 3…

113
00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:34.269
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: more MDX stuff, which is just the moving of files, for the markdown.

114
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:41.960
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: and then a custom CSS, and a DocuSource config, the deletion of Gatsby,

115
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:45.729
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: And… the removal of the old generator.

116
00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.970
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So it's like… 4 files?

117
00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.409
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay. And then, if you look at the overcommit.

118
00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:59.000
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: You'll see the 82, but that's all just marked down documents being generated.

119
00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.079
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, it should be pretty easy to, like.

120
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.279
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Like, verify, like, what's going on.

121
00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.829
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: So, if you look here, they're all in the methods.

122
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:15.490
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: It's literally the stuff that got generated.

123
00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:22.279
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Does that answer everything?

124
00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:27.320
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, it's on my end. I don't know if someone else has any questions regarding this.

125
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:29.510
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Okay.

126
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:37.490
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Okay, alright, so I'm gonna cede the floor to, Sims, I think.

127
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:44.210
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, thanks, Zane. This is great.

128
00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:56.490
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Sorry for not having too many updates from my side. I've been traveling for the last one month, and I've been out of office, just literally locked in today.

129
00:16:57.160 --> 00:17:02.709
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Thanks for creating the thread, Mercy. I saw some feedback.

130
00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:07.449
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Most of it is not actionable, except few

131
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:12.299
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: variable change, I guess, but other than that.

132
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.319
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I think we should… we're still waiting for reviews from people.

133
00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:22.270
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: If there's any, we can work on it and try and merge this.

134
00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:31.569
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, about the review, I think, we are kind of, like, too late for this year, so…

135
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:39.650
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I… like I said earlier, I wanted to take it over to ACDT. I think the next ACDT should be around…

136
00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:46.519
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'm not sure, but it's sometime, I think, second week of, january, I'm guessing.

137
00:17:46.800 --> 00:18:02.300
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So we can move it over there so that we can get more eyes on it. Then for the reviews that is actionable, we can actually, like, implement it, and then next year, we can take it over to ACDT, get Mario, and

138
00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:05.639
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Other core devs to also have an input on it.

139
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:15.770
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah, that works. Yeah, I can spend, some time before the next ACDC meeting and address some of the,

140
00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:19.510
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: points that was raised. But yeah, those are really minor ones.

141
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.730
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Nothing, big that it has to be changed.

142
00:18:23.290 --> 00:18:28.069
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: So it should be easy. Yeah, I can be ready for the next, SADC.

143
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:45.009
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so I just shared the link on the chat. I can see someone from Aragon's team here. If you can also take a look at it and drop us a feedback, that would be really helpful. Anyone else who also have an input on this can also do that. Thank you.

144
00:18:46.050 --> 00:18:47.289
Tullio | Erigon: Sure, sure, I'll do.

145
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.329
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I don't know if you have any other thing we want to discuss.

146
00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:06.620
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And sorry, thank you, Zane. The website looks much more better and usable now.

147
00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.549
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: I'm cool, I'm cool.

148

Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah, I'm hoping that people are able to, like.

149
00:19:14.490 --> 00:19:20.700
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: jump in, add docs wherever they want, or style it however they want as well. It's just standard DocuSource.

150
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:23.329
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: With, a little extra.

151
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:25.740
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: In terms of plugins, so…

152
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:30.319
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, we can also, like, I don't know…

153
00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:35.030

Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Also, make an intro about the new docu… the website.

155
00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.609
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Because it's a lot more usable currently, unlike before.

156
00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:47.079
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Yeah, I'm hoping for it.

157
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:52.290
Zane Starr | OpenRPC: Okay. You think that, like, when is the next ACDC? Just…
