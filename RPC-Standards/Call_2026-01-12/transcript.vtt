00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.430
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello?

2
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.170
EF Zoom Bot: Hello, I'm a sec.

3
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.980
EF Zoom Bot: I'm making you the host now.

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.750
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

5
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.600
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank you.

6
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello.

7
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:39.760
Tullio | Erigon: Hello.

8
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Mmm.

9
00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.429
Felix (Geth): So, was anything decided in ACDT regarding the error codes?

10
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.760
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: No, it's kind of like, an async, decision.

11
00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.659
Felix (Geth): Okay, alright, so they… but you guys talked about it?

12
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:43.060
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, we did, Sims did make a presentation. I don't know if Simi can just talk a little about… yeah?

13
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:54.900
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I just presented, I told them where we are at, and, the, the outcome was, the other clients, everyone will take a look at this, and,

14
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.560
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Leave some feedback, so we can match it.

15
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.489
Felix (Geth): Okay, that's good, that sounds good. Sounds like there's more exposure to it.

16
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.830
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah…

17
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:16.120
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: The thing is, we only got 4 minutes, so couldn't talk too much or gather any feedbacks on… on call. Hopefully they'll leave some on the PR.

18
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:33.140
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, I think, we just have to wait for them to give us a feedback, and then we can start writing the test. But I wanted to ask, do you have, like, any test plan

19
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.800
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Like, you've already mapped out, for this.

20
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:47.869
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I can actually port over the test suit that I wrote into the RPC test. The only thing is we cannot cover every…

21
00:02:47.990 --> 00:03:00.719
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: error codes, because as I mentioned, the client setup, the local Docker setup, or client setup, doesn't allow you to specify all the limits. They have, differences.

22
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:09.629
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: So we cannot simulate all negative conditions, but we can do for half of them, at least. But we still have to decide

23
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.070
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: On, on verbal communication on, we agreed to implement the rest of them.

24
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.039
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: or at least, enable the clients to specify some limits. For example.

25
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:39.400
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I'm not sure if I'm saying this right, but maybe Nethermine doesn't allow you to set the, transaction gas limit, but it probably does the block gas limit. And some of these clients behave slightly differently when you want to simulate non-stu high ed, or

26
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.510
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: So it's very hard to use the same test case across different clients to produce the same negative outcome.

27
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.290
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Well, yeah, I can do some of them, though.

28
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.990
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, if you just… when you do,

29
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.979
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Can you signal in the group? And also, I wanted to understand if…

30
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:10.859
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: The test you're talking about, you used, ROPC test gene for it.

31
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:27.590
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Not yet, no. I wanted to try, before touching the RPC test gen, I wanted to try it as a separate group, because RPC test gen is a little complicated for me to set up and spend time on at the moment. I just want to get a sense of how different clients are behaving.

32
00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:43.269
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Because this… this means I have to touch the Genesis file, set the limits to replicate these error… error codes, which the RPC test gen doesn't do at the moment. So I… I wrote my own, own, test suit.

33
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:53.129
Felix (Geth): I'm happy to work with you on this. So there is, we have the… we are in control of the test chain, so if there's some setting in the test chain that you need.

34
00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:03.889
Felix (Geth): we can… we can definitely get it. And you can… the way we use it… the way we do this in the RPTC test gen, usually, is that we do load the…

35
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.670
Felix (Geth): we do load the JSON files which are related to the test chain.

36
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.509
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Okay. And then we…

37
00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:22.440
Felix (Geth): basically, we have access to the numbers that were used for the configuration. And so then, for example, if the Genesis specifies a certain gas limit, or if the latest block has a certain gas limit.

38
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:30.630
Felix (Geth): Then you can… you have access to that from within the test generator, and then you can send a transaction that is, for example, larger than this limit.

39
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.899
Felix (Geth): just by… but… but it is still… it has to be done this way, so that

40
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:54.709
Felix (Geth): when we change the test chain, for example, when there's a new fork, we want to have it in the test chain, then the test generation needs to react to these changes as well. So that's why we always have to parameterize it this way, like, we basically take the test chain as given, and then generate the test according to the configuration of that chain.

41
00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:04.159
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Understood. No, that makes sense. Yeah, definitely, we'll reach out to you. Just one concern is that, certain clients,

42
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:20.359
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: doesn't have all the limits set by get. I've noticed I had trouble generating the same error that I got with get on other clients, which means they have a different… probably different setting name or a variable name.

43
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.829
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: as part of the Genesis config, or maybe as part of, while spinning up the, client itself.

44
00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.910
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Doesn't respect those configs, especially when you think about it's a… it's a local…

45
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:50.059
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: dev mode, right, for most of these, test setups that we spin up the client notice. It's not a full P2P network, so they don't respect all these settings, so I have trouble replicating the same test scenario across different, client implementations.

46
00:06:50.060 --> 00:07:06.200
Felix (Geth): So in Hive, it's a bit different. So in Hive, we do spin up the client in its default configuration, but we also make some settings. So, for example, the RPC each call gas limit, for example, there's a specific one that we use in Hive, so if you want to make a call that goes over that, then it gets…

47
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:22.309
Felix (Geth): So we are… we are in some… we are in control in Hive, in terms of the… how the client gets launched and what settings get applied. That said, I would also say it's not the goal to have a completely exhaustive…

48
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.759
Felix (Geth): Coverage of all error codes in the test, because it's just gonna be impossible.

49
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.530
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, we want to cover some of them, but…

50
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.159
Felix (Geth): For all of them, that's gonna be quite hard, and this.

51
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.820
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I agree.

52
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:46.660
Felix (Geth): the appeal of your proposal, that it gives clients the option to have these errors, but it doesn't mean they have to have these errors. It's just more that if they have the error, they have to agree on the code.

53
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.239
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Correct. I agree, yeah, that's the goal, too.

54
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:58.379
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I'm in with you there. So yeah, I'll start looking at, implementing this in Hive. I'll reach out to you, Felix. Thanks very much.

55
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:10.770
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you very much. I wanted to go on the next agenda, which is,

56
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.730
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: to add the bug traces and execution API, chase.

57
00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.470
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, God.

58
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:30.499
Chase Wright: Yeah, I know Felix and I talked about this a little bit internally. I do have some PRs, to look at some of the

59
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:45.889
Chase Wright: to add, you know, debug trace block my number, debug trace call, things like that. I know that, it's gonna be difficult to get, the clients to agree, but I do think there are some low-hanging fruits,

60
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:49.750
Chase Wright: Especially in, like, debug trace call.

61
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.760
Chase Wright: And so, I mean, I have PRs open, I just… I'm not sure what the next steps would be to…

62
00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.419
Chase Wright: Get those merged, or get them approved, or… or even just reviewed.

63
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:16.390
Felix (Geth): So I think it's quite good that you opened this, and that it has a smaller scope, so the scope is very small in your PR. It's only about trace call, and then it's about the trace block by number, right?

64
00:09:16.930 --> 00:09:36.350
Chase Wright: Yeah, so I have one for trace block by number that is specifically to trace block zero, that way that the error code can be standardized across clients, which was, you know, part of the last discussion around error codes, because the clients don't send the same message or error for that. And then I do have one for trace call that

65
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:51.499
Chase Wright: I've used in the past, which clients are generating different outputs on, and so I figured it'd be… be good for that. And yes, my intention was to start extremely small on just these two little things, and then try to expand from there. After…

66
00:09:51.500 --> 00:10:01.850
Chase Wright: After it was put into the specs, right? Because the debug trace anything is just not in any of the specs, not in any of the generators, so I figured I'd just start there.

67
00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:09.510
Felix (Geth): Yeah, I think that's good. We might even go a step further and try to split it, so we have basically just the addition of debug trace calls.

68
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:18.669
Felix (Geth): First, and then also in parallel, you can pursue this, like, debug, trace, block by number. They are very similar, though, like, the output format, I think, is the same.

69
00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:24.290
Felix (Geth): So it's kind of… these two tracers have the same general output.

70
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:27.289
Felix (Geth): So, it's… it's good.

71
00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.869
Felix (Geth): I'm just wondering, okay, so trace block by number, so here you're using the…

72
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:41.240
Felix (Geth): GoEthereum type of input with the tracer name and the tracer config in the test.

73
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:44.279
Felix (Geth): So this is something which is kind of…

74
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:49.070
Felix (Geth): I'm actually not sure if this is universal or not. I know that there is…

75
00:10:52.900 --> 00:11:06.280
Chase Wright: I mean, it's not… it's not perfectly universal, and I think that's… that's part of the… the problem, right? So, like, all of the clients do support, you know, Call Tracer, except I think, Besu doesn't support Call Tracer, which…

76
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:24.640
Chase Wright: You know, like, maybe they should, but whatever. And then, you know, all of the options that are in the, the call tracer, or not call tracer, but the native tracer, additional parameters, most of the clients do support most of them. It's, it's not perfect, it's not universal.

77
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:27.730
Chase Wright: But that's really why I'm starting at, you know.

78
00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:33.720
Chase Wright: just, hey, what's the error code when you try and trace the Genesis, right? Like, I'm just starting there.

79
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.530
Felix (Geth): Okay, it's just about the error. I thought it's more about the… it's more about the tracer output.

80
00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:57.330
Chase Wright: So, Trace Call… Trace Call does, do one opcode trace, and the clients return different outputs, so even Nethermine and Geth are returning different outputs, and I figured, well, hey, if that's the case, you know, then…

81
00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.160
Chase Wright: Then maybe that should be fixed, too.

82
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:04.879
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah. Please go ahead today.

83
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.329
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: You raised your hand, sorry, I can't pronounce your name.

84
00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:30.609
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, okay, yeah. Hi, everyone. Yeah, wanted to say that, yeah, I appreciated this PR on the BuckTrace call as well. I think that we… maybe we should try to be…

85
00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:41.010
Tullio | Erigon: a little more ambitious, and, trying… it would be valuable, I've left a comment on the PR to… to try to fully specify

86
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:44.510
Tullio | Erigon: the… mmm…

87
00:12:44.630 --> 00:13:01.560
Tullio | Erigon: the tracer names, for example, I mean, which tracer must be supported by an implementation in order to be called compliant. And, but especially on the schema for the expected output, for the result.

88
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.950
Tullio | Erigon: We should try to enforce it.

89
00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:14.760
Tullio | Erigon: More, and, fully specify which fields with which structure, depending on which tracer.

90
00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:22.819
Tullio | Erigon: Because… If we want to… push for a standardization. I think that…

91
00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:36.230
Tullio | Erigon: that's what we should try to do. Even if it's painful and it's a bit of work, I can try to contribute on it.

92
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:42.430
Tullio | Erigon: If it's… if you're okay with it, but I think we should try to be more ambitious.

93
00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:48.880
Chase Wright: Yeah, I'm definitely open to more collaboration and input.

94
00:13:49.620 --> 00:14:08.529
Chase Wright: My… my only thing was, I just… I really… I was trying to figure out how the RPC test gen stuff works, and how… how the spec works, and… and get something, minimal that… that was workable, and that, you know, I didn't want perfection to be the enemy of progress, right?

95
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:12.360
Chase Wright: But, yeah, I'm open to… to more,

96
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:16.609
Chase Wright: to more ambitious specification here.

97
00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:24.639
Chase Wright: Or, like… like Felix said, like, we could remove debug trace block by number for right now, and just…

98
00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:32.519
Chase Wright: do the debug trace call, but I think that's gonna have the exact same problem, probably, because debug trace call…

99
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.679
Chase Wright: specify a tracer, right? So…

100
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.750
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.

101
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:48.940
Chase Wright: So yeah, I'm not 100% sure how to… how to move forward with that, but if you have ideas, then…

102
00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.979
Chase Wright: I'm all ears.

103
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:53.730
Felix (Geth): I think one…

104
00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:54.120
Tullio | Erigon: Maybe…

105
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.890
Felix (Geth): Sorry, sorry.

106
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:57.600
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, sorry if Felic's gone.

107
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:07.560
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so I wanted to say that with debug trace call specifically, it's kind of like ETHC call with tracing.

108
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:17.389
Felix (Geth): And the last parameter of it, in get at least, is this trace call config object that contains the, like, tracer name and things like that, but

109
00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:25.060
Felix (Geth): we don't even need to do that. We could just try to make a test that doesn't have this last argument, and it's only about

110
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.699
Felix (Geth): Tracing a single call at the head block of the test chain.

111
00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:46.550
Felix (Geth): and then see what are the differences in the output across the clients. One of the problems that we have is adding tests right now into the main test suit means they will fail on all the clients, so we will basically add test failures to the clients. It's okay for me, but I just already know that

112
00:15:46.900 --> 00:16:02.739
Felix (Geth): there are already too many failures. But anyway, I would say let's start very small and just add a test for only this, and then see how far we… how far we get, because the differences which are in opcode tracing are really deep sometimes in some of the clients. They have these, like…

113
00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:13.559
Felix (Geth): different ways of accounting and different output fields and so on, so we have to standardize this part first. And once we can agree on a shared trace format, there's also, I think, an EIP for it.

114
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.049
Felix (Geth): Then we can actually go to the next…

115
00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:22.500
Felix (Geth): step. So there is, for example, EIP3155.

116
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:29.810
Felix (Geth): which is about this. I can quickly try to post that here to the… to the chat.

117
00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.619
Felix (Geth): So this EIP is about this.

118
00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:38.390
Felix (Geth): It's about the… It's about standardizing the trace format.

119
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:41.540
Felix (Geth): And, it is currently in last call.

120
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:49.600
Felix (Geth): But it's been… it was… the last call deadline was mid-March last year, so I guess, yeah. And this EIP is,

121
00:16:50.090 --> 00:17:04.650
Felix (Geth): 5 years old, just for you guys to be aware of the prehistory of this particular problem. So, yes, it would be nice to agree, but we have to start small here, because this… other people have tried, and this is not super easy.

122
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:12.109
Felix (Geth): So if we go in it with the big ambition, I am just afraid that it's gonna be overwhelming, because the basics are not…

123
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.150
Felix (Geth): Right.

124
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:19.239
Tullio | Erigon: Okay, I… I agree. So, in… in that sense, I think…

125
00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:29.569
Tullio | Erigon: I agree we should split the PR into… in two, and have a separate one for the bug trace call, and another one for the bug…

126
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.790
Tullio | Erigon: trace block by number. This… the smaller…

127
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:37.489
Tullio | Erigon: There's… there's more or less the context than the easiest.

128
00:17:41.670 --> 00:17:46.390
Felix (Geth): So it is valuable, I think, to arrive at a place eventually where

129
00:17:46.580 --> 00:18:03.119
Felix (Geth): we can do basic opcode tracing in the same way across the clients. And, I do also want to say that, like, the Geth way of handling it, where we added another parameter to trace call to allow you to specify another tracer, things like that, this

130
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:20.980
Felix (Geth): it was kind of done, like, a long time ago, and I would say maybe today we wouldn't really do it this way anymore, or… and I feel like if we now go ahead and try to standardize this, maybe it is already supported, like you say, Chase. I'm not… I wasn't actually aware of it, but if all the clients can accept this, I'm happy with it, because I feel like, yeah, we…

131
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:26.729
Felix (Geth): Obviously, people want different… they don't always want the opcode trace, they may want another one, but…

132
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:34.989
Felix (Geth): Maybe, for the purposes of standardization, is gonna create a lot of tension when all of a sudden all clients are forced to have this…

133
00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.910
Felix (Geth): this…

134
00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:44.189
Felix (Geth): this parameter, or I don't know, that's why I was saying, let's maybe just remove this parameter for now and focus on the very basic opcode trace, because

135
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.720
Felix (Geth): If we can make any progress in standardizing that, it's a huge win.

136
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.620
Felix (Geth): So, that's what I would…

137
00:18:50.420 --> 00:19:02.859
Chase Wright: Yeah, so, from my perspective, the primary reason why I included and went with the call tracer is, you know, from a JSON RPC perspective, like.

138
00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:11.189
Chase Wright: the… that is the call that, like, 99% of all of the dApps use. They… they all use Call Tracer, right?

139
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.970
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, yeah.

140
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.350
Chase Wright: And it's the default.

141
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:23.729
Felix (Geth): It is the default, so if you leave out the last parameter to debug trace call and getth, for example, if you don't specify it, it will still do this trace by default. At least, I think that's what it will do.

142
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:32.599
Felix (Geth): So it has this, like, by default, it's the call trace. It's just that if you specify this, like, object that contains, like, the tracer name and tracer config and stuff.

143
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:38.499
Felix (Geth): maybe with some clients, it's gonna not work, but… or maybe it will, I don't know. I'm just…

144
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:46.970
Felix (Geth): Trying to be careful here and say that, like, yeah, the original debug trace call didn't have this configurability, it was only about the call traces.

145
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:53.630
Felix (Geth): Sorry, maybe it was just a misunderstanding. Never mind, I think we can also move on. Anyway…

146
00:19:59.730 --> 00:20:02.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, Abamura… oh, sorry.

147
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:09.749
Chase Wright: No, I was just gonna say, like, yeah, we can move on, I guess, but, like, I don't… I'm not 100% clear on the actual…

148
00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:11.540
Chase Wright: Next steps.

149
00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.760
Felix (Geth): So…

150
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:17.759
Chase Wright: Do you want me to refactor this into multiple PRs, or…

151
00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:22.790
Felix (Geth): So I would say, let's have a… let's have one PR that is about adding debug trace call only.

152
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:27.670
Felix (Geth): Okay. We have another PR in parallel that's about adding debug trace block by number.

153
00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:45.059
Felix (Geth): And with the tests, yeah, with the tests, we have to see, like, it's good if we have one or more, like, if we have multiple tests. For example, one thing we have to add is also a test, where it calls, like, multiple contracts, like, one contract calls another one, so we can set that up.

154
00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:58.129
Felix (Geth): And then, like, so we have to put some contract in the test chain that, like, makes another call, like a sub-call, because for tracing, the sub calls is really the important stuff, right? So it… then it has, like, a non-zero depth.

155
00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:09.379
Felix (Geth): And there's gonna be, like, the return data and stuff like that. That has to be in the trace as well. If we don't… if the call doesn't actually perform, like, a multi-contract interaction, then there isn't gonna be any return data.

156
00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.200
Felix (Geth): Inside of the…

157
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:21.150
Felix (Geth): Inside of the trace. So, let's just try to get to a point where we have, like, 2-3 tests for the tracing, and it's just about the call trace, and then we can see

158
00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:29.749
Felix (Geth): how far we get with the clients on that. So we do have to eventually get the clients in this call, or we have to bring it up on ACDT.

159
00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:32.319
Felix (Geth): That this has to be standardized.

160
00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:45.920
Tullio | Erigon: Okay, I agree, but then I would say, okay, let's do two separate PRs, and in the PR for the bug trace call, we can remove the trace config.

161
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:49.969
Tullio | Erigon: parameter, as Felix suggested, because it's valuable to

162
00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:58.260
Tullio | Erigon: focus on the pole tracer. But then, let's specify

163
00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:03.419
Tullio | Erigon: the… the output for the result in the case of the code tracer.

164
00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:05.819
Tullio | Erigon: That's what I would suggest.

165
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.650
Chase Wright: Sorry, can you repeat that last part? I was…

166
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:16.169
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, I would… I would add,

167
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:21.840
Tullio | Erigon: A full specification of the schema for the result in the case of the call tracer.

168
00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.220
Tullio | Erigon: For the debug tree school.

169
00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:30.350
Tullio | Erigon: Which is basically what's in the IEP, I suppose, but I need to.

170
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.200
Tullio | Erigon: I'll read it again.

171
00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:43.199
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so basically what… what we're trying to say is that, like, we have to…

172
00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:49.929
Felix (Geth): try and make a JSON RPC specification out of this EIP3155.

173
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:51.550
Felix (Geth): And then…

174
00:22:52.050 --> 00:23:02.689
Felix (Geth): basically bring it up with the clients. So this part is basically gonna mean, nowadays it's called championing the EAP, so basically, we have to go on one of the calls, like, probably ACDT, and tell them that

175
00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:07.070
Felix (Geth): they have to work on EIP3155.

176
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:15.749
Felix (Geth): And this goes for, like, all the clients then, so they all have to… so either they don't support… we don't even know how to handle the optional methods right now, but, like, if we…

177
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:17.750
Felix (Geth): Whatever.

178
00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:20.579
Felix (Geth): We just have to make sure that

179
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:28.800
Felix (Geth): we all agree on the trace output format, and the EIP kind of tries to make that happen.

180
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:36.889
Felix (Geth): So there is an existing EIP that tries to fix… that tries to standardize the tracer output format, the call tracer output format, so we have to

181
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:41.180
Felix (Geth): the next step is to push this EIP onto the clients.

182
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:55.349
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I just have a question, sorry.

183
00:23:55.550 --> 00:24:04.260
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Do we have, like, a champion for the EIP, or who is willing to, champion the EIP?

184
00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: If we… if we intend to move forward with this, that's what I'm asking.

185
00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:14.719
Felix (Geth): Yeah, well, so my suggestion was that, like, basically Chase

186
00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.670
Felix (Geth): since you were bringing it up, what I was trying to say with this, like, bringing up the EAP, that

187
00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:28.499
Felix (Geth): you… basically, if you want to make progress on standardizing call trades, you have to champion this EAP, and championing this EAP means raising it in the calls.

188
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:31.979
Felix (Geth): And, bugging the clients about it.

189
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:39.960
Chase Wright: I mean, I can try to do that, but, like, 90% of this stuff is over my head, so…

190
00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:54.199
Felix (Geth): Well, it's just about… in the end, it's just about the output fields, so it is basically what you are doing now. It's not, like, any more complicated than that. Mostly, the nice part about this is the EIP is already published and written, so it's already kind of in.

191
00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:02.700
Chase Wright: it's not like you have to write a new EIP, it's like, the EIP is there, and the EIP itself is not complicated, it just says, like, the trace has to contain, like.

192
00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.070
Felix (Geth): PC, op, gas, gas, cost, and stuff like that, like, all these fields, and what they mean.

193
00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:12.139
Felix (Geth): So we just have to basically tell everyone again that this is what we want.

194
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:18.200
Chase Wright: Sweet.

195
00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:29.090
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I can do debugging if, that's okay.

196
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.540
Felix (Geth): That's kind of a collective effort, yeah, I mean, you can always.

197
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:33.150
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Is she also…

198
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:49.500
Felix (Geth): be a part of this. Like, this is… it is… it's like an… this is like a shared battle, I would say. Like, I mean, this EIP has been open for 5 years, nobody is really looking at it, because there's no champion of it right now. Martin, who is the author, he used to be a bit of the champion of this.

199
00:25:49.590 --> 00:26:02.220
Felix (Geth): because he, wrote a command line tool that used the trace output, and he got annoyed with the clients not having the same output format, so that's why he created this. But it is…

200
00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:08.729
Felix (Geth): This… it is, like, an ongoing concern, like, a lot of people, you know, would benefit from having a shared format.

201
00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:15.199
Felix (Geth): It's just that it requires someone to take the lead on Actually, making that happen.

202
00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:26.229
Tullio | Erigon: Oh, I have an honest question about that. Do we really think that the EIP is the

203
00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.439
Tullio | Erigon: I mean, most effective mechanism for

204
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.459
Tullio | Erigon: Going on with the standardization.

205
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:43.760
Tullio | Erigon: I'm asking because… I've seen in the past that it can be… A bit difficult to…

206
00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:54.750
Tullio | Erigon: to have… to reach agreement on… on the IP, and… and various scheduling within forks, and…

207
00:26:55.150 --> 00:27:03.469
Tullio | Erigon: In the end of the day, I mean, we… the different client implementations, currently have…

208
00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:14.949
Tullio | Erigon: slightly different, or maybe, not so slightly, different, implementations of the RPC layer, but…

209
00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:18.450
Tullio | Erigon: It's not a, subject to consensus.

210
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:28.170
Tullio | Erigon: So, I'm… I'm a bit afraid that, if we… I mean, it's okay to…

211
00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:46.389
Tullio | Erigon: to go on with this specific IP, but if we establish a precedent, and then we are going to use always the IP mechanism in order to push for standardization at the RPC layer, I'm afraid that it will become a bit…

212
00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:49.820
Tullio | Erigon: slow, I used to say.

213
00:27:51.600 --> 00:28:03.800
Felix (Geth): Yeah, it's a good question. Honestly, I don't know. I was just mostly pointing to this EIP because it is an existing attempt by someone else from 5 years ago to attack the exact same problem, and the problem has not changed.

214
00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:19.779
Felix (Geth): if you want to get a call trace from different clients, they have differences, and it's annoying, and we want to change that. And, I mean, yeah, it would be good if this was eventually done, so the EIP is one way of doing it. It wasn't very successful, just publishing the EIP is not enough.

215
00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:29.689
Felix (Geth): we know that, so there has to be more than that. So you can try to push it in another way, but ultimately, these are all means of achieving the same goal, which is the specif…

216
00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:31.600
Felix (Geth): Standardizing the call traces.

217
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:39.389
Felix (Geth): the goal is always the same, it's just you have different methods available to you. You can publish an EAP, you can publish a blog post about it, you can…

218
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.959
Felix (Geth): Implemented yourself and all the clients, if you prefer, but ultimately, the outcome is gonna be the same.

219
00:28:52.380 --> 00:29:10.860
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, I… I just want a clarification. Is there a way to get, a sort of feedback from the previous authors to understand what really happened, and why, there was no, like, further, progress on this particular EIP, so that we'll know if there's some things we need to put,

220
00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.040
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Into consideration before moving forward with this?

221
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:21.369
Felix (Geth): So, Martin himself is not available anymore. I mean, I know him personally, and I know that he, I mean, he just basically has…

222
00:29:21.610 --> 00:29:26.289
Felix (Geth): He quit his job, so, like, a while ago, like, a year ago, so he's not around.

223
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:45.739
Felix (Geth): If you want to get a written statement from him about this, it would somehow be possible, but I don't think it's gonna change much. Also, I know kind of what happened, so he created this, he brought it up eventually, but Martin was not a good EIP champion in the way that is required. He was… basically, he tried to make a good technical specification of it.

224
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:54.779
Felix (Geth): And he tried to make people understand the rationale of this EAP by explaining it to them, but ultimately, he wasn't able to

225
00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.780
Felix (Geth): Get a lot of traction for…

226
00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:04.860
Felix (Geth): for making this change, and it's maybe simply because he wasn't annoying enough, or…

227
00:30:05.460 --> 00:30:14.699
Felix (Geth): I don't know, it wasn't urgent enough for anyone. And, I mean, it still doesn't seem to be particularly urgent for anyone to have a… maybe now it is a bit more, like, I'm pretty sure…

228
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:20.050
Felix (Geth): The client developers also have changed their attitudes a couple of times over the years, and…

229
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.030
Felix (Geth): We see it now that the…

230
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:32.079
Felix (Geth): it is much easier to get clients to agree on RPCE than it was maybe 5 years ago. So it is just worth trying again, I think.

231
00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:35.970
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you.

232
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:48.609
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So I guess we can, like, try and debate this, I think, and moving forward to the next should be the fashioning.

233
00:30:49.050 --> 00:30:52.349
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Which, I don't think Curry is here.

234
00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:58.810
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: But I just wanted to point out this PR, if it's okay to be meshed, although I don't know why the CI is failing.

235
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.580
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: This year is filling on so many PRs, I'm not sure why.

236
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:05.450
Felix (Geth): On the specs?

237
00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.559
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the, yeah, API.

238
00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:23.810
Felix (Geth): Yes, so I can speak about this. First of all, I can speak about maybe the problem of why it's, failing, but let's… so, can we first, just quickly go over what is the next action item? Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm trying…

239
00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:31.370
Felix (Geth): Check the… The next thing in the agenda is the, versioning, and then also.

240
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:36.460
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: first take a look at this open PR for the Ducosaris, websites.

241
00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.130
Felix (Geth): Oh, yeah.

242
00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:38.269
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'll share the link.

243
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:45.020
Felix (Geth): Hmm… Okay, yeah, that's a pretty big item.

244
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:55.689
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I… yes, I saw it, I asked, he said it's not everything that is going to be merged, so… but I don't understand…

245
00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:01.799
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Exactly, because I asked him why we had, like, over 34,000 lines of code.

246
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:06.839
Felix (Geth): Oh, you mean for the… for the website now? You're talking about this, like, DocuSaurus?

247
00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:08.150
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

248
00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:19.870
Felix (Geth): Yeah, so this, I mean, this does change a lot, because… basically… Changes the generator.

249
00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:27.450
Felix (Geth): this PR is… Require someone to just… Try it out.

250
00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:38.559
Felix (Geth): And then just go for… I mean, we basically just have to decide if we want this or not. I mean, I… I looked at… we can just look at it together now, honestly. Let me just, one second…

251
00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.370
Felix (Geth): Let me just, do this.

252
00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:50.450
Felix (Geth): Okay, so now we just have to… one sec… Sorry?

253
00:32:50.870 --> 00:33:02.630
Felix (Geth): Goddamn, this is not super easy now, because I have this window shared, and then this has the tab. Okay, so now you guys should all be seeing this website.

254
00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:05.229
Felix (Geth): Can you see it?

255
00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.170
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

256
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.840
Felix (Geth): So this is the output of this PR.

257
00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:18.320
Felix (Geth): And just to give a quick reference, so… if you…

258
00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.390
Felix (Geth): Go to the current website, it looks like this.

259
00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.980
Felix (Geth): So, the difference is that in the old website, you have a menu here.

260
00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:40.959
Felix (Geth): that links to some Markdown documents, and then you have the main specification, which is here, and then this one is just expandable…

261
00:33:43.910 --> 00:33:51.210
Felix (Geth): It's like this thing where you have to keep clicking to expand. Like, it's just always… so this is the method name, this is… these are the parameters.

262
00:33:51.310 --> 00:34:05.839
Felix (Geth): And these are the results. I have to say, the typography in this page is pretty horrible, because the method name is kind of small, the description is the same size as the method name, and these headings, which are just… these headings are bigger than everything else, basically

263
00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:22.030
Felix (Geth): When I look at this, I get kind of confused, but basically, this is the input to the method, and this is the output. And these are positional parameters, and this is the first parameter, so this method only has one, and it also has some error codes here in the table, as well as an example for each method.

264
00:34:22.580 --> 00:34:27.659
Felix (Geth): For example, here in Estimate Gas, you can see it has two parameters, the transaction and the block.

265
00:34:27.810 --> 00:34:39.759
Felix (Geth): And then the block here can be specified in one of two ways, the block number or the block tag. So anyway, that's what the specification looks like right now. So we can look at the same method in the new one.

266
00:34:40.610 --> 00:34:45.409
Felix (Geth): ETH estimate gas, so it has them all on the side here, which I think is kind of an improvement.

267
00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:50.090
Felix (Geth): In some ways, you can click, and then the page itself

268
00:34:50.690 --> 00:34:55.469
Felix (Geth): Unfortunately, it's a bit messy, but… It has this…

269
00:34:55.860 --> 00:35:05.840
Felix (Geth): Element here on the side is not great, that it takes up so much space, but basically this is supposed to be the area where you can try the method against the server.

270
00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.050
Felix (Geth): At the moment, it's not available.

271
00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:15.960
Felix (Geth): I don't really know what this is supposed to be, like, it's like with opening it in…

272
00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:21.170
Felix (Geth): But yeah, whatever, you can open it in the AI, I guess. But then, so here are the parameters.

273
00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.859
Felix (Geth): M… This is the first parameter, and this is the second parameter.

274
00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:33.890
Felix (Geth): Do you guys think this is an improvement over… over this.

275
00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:42.370
Felix (Geth): So just if you try to compare it, like, this is… Supposed to be… an improvement.

276
00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:49.330
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I see it as an improvement, but I think it needs further refinement. I don't know if what I'm saying makes sense.

277
00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:56.969
Felix (Geth): It makes a lot of sense, yeah, so I think also similar, like, it is somehow better, because you can see the methods, and they are not, like.

278
00:35:57.090 --> 00:36:07.549
Felix (Geth): to expand, because this page is all about expanding things, I would say. So now we have expanded this method, and we can expand the parameter, and then we have to… you just have to keep

279
00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.809
Felix (Geth): keep clicking, which I personally find it a bit…

280
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:20.740
Felix (Geth): annoying, but it is how it is. So with this one, for example, we can check this is ETH get code. So if we, go here, for example.

281
00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:23.719
Felix (Geth): It's a bit better, because

282
00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:34.390
Felix (Geth): First of all, you don't have to expand the method, it has a page, so that's good. The parameters are listed here in this weird way, where it's, like, one, and then they have these separator lines.

283
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:48.369
Felix (Geth): Weirdly enough, there's a line here, but this line is actually a bit misleading, because this… these options refer to this parameter. So this is the parameter, and these are the options for the parameter, but it has a line here, which makes it…

284
00:36:48.620 --> 00:37:07.619
Felix (Geth): kind of weird, because it's like, it's another parameter, but it's not. So this could be improved a bit, I would say. And then the result here, I… like, I like it that you don't have to click so much. That's mostly what I like. The content is exactly the same. It is better because it actually renders the markdown inside of this comment, though, so that's good. So you can see here that

285
00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:11.660
Felix (Geth): This explains… Kind of a lot more…

286
00:37:12.130 --> 00:37:14.750
Felix (Geth): about it. It's a bit weird that it explains

287
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:18.000
Felix (Geth): so much, but I think it is honestly better.

288
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:25.590
Felix (Geth): Whereas here, if you check, for example, here, the block tag, it has the description, which contains markdown, but the markdown is not rendered.

289
00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:29.909
Felix (Geth): So, yeah. And then here also with the enum, it's kind of like…

290
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:37.300
Felix (Geth): I mean, yeah, it's good. If you know what this is, it… this is good, but if you don't know, then it… it has…

291
00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.240
Felix (Geth): It's not very helpful.

292
00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:46.799
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, I understand what you're saying, but the reason for that is that in the other websites, I think they were using Gatsby.

293
00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:53.650
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So there was kind of, like, a build issue. They didn't have to, like, move back to the CSRS again.

294
00:37:54.310 --> 00:37:58.690
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Because we moved from Dugoseras to Gatsby, Gatsby to Dagasarus again.

295
00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.450
Felix (Geth): Yeah.

296
00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.350
Felix (Geth): Well, so…

297
00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.560
Felix (Geth): So, I think it's an improvement.

298
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:20.580
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, it's an improvement, but we need… we need some things to be refined. Like, the… sorry, can you go back to the other website?

299
00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:30.330
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yes, which one? The new one, yes? Yeah, the new one. This, request, I don't know if it is working, because it's… it's meant to work, I guess so.

300
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:34.820
Felix (Geth): I mean, it doesn't work because it talks to local hosts. I don't have anything running on there.

301
00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:35.920
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, oh, okay.

302
00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:40.989
Felix (Geth): So if I go to this, like, I don't know what's it called, like, publicnote.com or something, then this will work.

303
00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:43.020
Felix (Geth): Right?

304
00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:45.930
Felix (Geth): I don't know what's the… if there's, like, a…

305
00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:56.700
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I don't have any objection on this. I don't know if anyone has an opinion on if we should merge this, or…

306
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:57.829
Felix (Geth): So if we go…

307
00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:58.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: movement.

308
00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:05.130
Felix (Geth): If we input this here… And then we send it, then you see that it works. Like, here.

309
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:12.880
Felix (Geth): So you can just… if… depending what you enter here, it does totally work. So this is… this is working.

310
00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:28.260
Chase Wright: I think we all agree that this is an improvement, it's just, should we go back to the PR author and ask them to fix the parameters so that it's more obvious what's a parameter? Or should we just merge it and then…

311
00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:30.099
Chase Wright: Fix it later.

312
00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:37.350
Felix (Geth): I think we should, at this point, because the previous thing also isn't very, very good, like, this is honestly not very good.

313
00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.880
Felix (Geth): It does have this thing going for it where this… we have this inspector here.

314
00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:47.260
Felix (Geth): And then, so the whole idea with the inspector is that you can somehow…

315
00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:54.779
Felix (Geth): I don't fully know how this works, but there is a way… I think, of somehow pre-filling

316
00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:07.040
Felix (Geth): Yeah, here. So there's this Try It Now button under each method, and I kind of like this, because then it will… Okay, now, this is a bit annoying, because it…

317
00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:10.970
Felix (Geth): kind of scrolls. This has some issues.

318
00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:14.440
Chase Wright: But all of the methods on the other one have examples, too. Like.

319
00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:14.879
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, yeah

320
00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:35.299
Felix (Geth): But what I'm trying to say is, like, it's a bit annoying that this thing is… takes up so much space. Like, I'm just opening this in, like, a normal font size, and basically half of the screen is just this thing, which, yeah, it's useful, but when you're looking at the specs, it might not be the first thing you want to do is send this request. You maybe just want to read about it.

321
00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:53.879
Felix (Geth): So, would be good if this was, like, minimized or something, like… but these are detailed changes, we don't actually have to make this change right now. I'm happy to just merge it, it's the same, and then we can just make another PR that, like, minimizes this by default or so, so you don't always have to have this example open all the time.

322
00:40:54.030 --> 00:41:02.100
Felix (Geth): And then also, maybe we can make yet another PR, like, we can basically make incremental improvements. I do think it's an improvement, so let's just merge it and then be done with it.

323
00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.269
Felix (Geth): You… are you okay with that?

324
00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:25.629
Felix (Geth): Everyone's giving thumbs up, so I think so. Okay, sorry, sorry, I didn't see. I didn't see. Okay, yeah, it's fine, it's fine. So let me just uncheck… oh, there's a lot of thumbs up.

325
00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:31.069
Felix (Geth): Okay, sorry, wait, what, how… I think my… is my screen still shared? No, it's not.

326
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.010
Felix (Geth): Okay.

327
00:41:32.330 --> 00:41:39.780
Felix (Geth): Okay, so I can, I will… I will merge this PR, so then we have it.

328
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:50.600
Felix (Geth): Okay. And then we can maybe talk a bit about, we can talk about,

329
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.030
Felix (Geth): why the CI is failing, maybe? Or do we have another topic on the agenda?

330
00:41:56.810 --> 00:42:00.450
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, we have, about the versioning.

331
00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:03.739
Felix (Geth): Yeah, right. So with the versioning…

332
00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:04.520
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: ready.

333
00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:18.989
Felix (Geth): It's ready, yes, but the versioning there is just… it's more like there's just some documentation. So actually, Chase and I, we talked about this quite a bit, as well as with, another guy, an EF, patches.

334
00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:31.379
Felix (Geth): who had also expressed some interest in working on this, so we had another idea about the versioning, so one of the things we should probably do is we should actually start creating releases of the API,

335
00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:43.259
Felix (Geth): and then also release the tests alongside it, so basically create, like, a release workflow. Because at the moment, it's a bit like… there's no versioning, so the latest spec is the latest, and that's it.

336
00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:54.019
Felix (Geth): And… but I do think that adding versioning to this is more than just adding the README file. Like, in this… in the existing PR about the versioning.

337
00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:58.800
Felix (Geth): it just adds some text in README that says, yeah, there are versions.

338
00:42:59.060 --> 00:43:02.760
Felix (Geth): But it doesn't really make the actual versions.

339
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:10.489
Felix (Geth): So, we have to… there's more work required to get the versioning scheme into action.

340
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:17.390
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so I wasn't aware of any further discussion. I was thinking this…

341
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:19.729
Felix (Geth): I mean, yeah.

342
00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:20.980
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: to end this point.

343
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.880
Felix (Geth): Bro, I mean, this is… This is 100%,

344
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:38.919
Felix (Geth): good, I would say. Like, we can also just merge this in, but then there has to be more work, because we have to actually create a 1.0 release, and Carrie is now on parental leave, so she's not gonna do that.

345
00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:42.860
Felix (Geth): And then also we have to…

346
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:59.290
Felix (Geth): Yeah, well, I mean, we have to kind of establish this release workflow by actually creating the releases and making sure that the latest tests are attached to the release as an artifact and things like that. So these things have to basically

347
00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:05.939
Felix (Geth): actually happen, like, we can merge the PR, but that's not the end, right? That's just, what we want.

348
00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.279
Felix (Geth): It's just a description of what we want.

349
00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:18.940
Felix (Geth): I do agree with what's in the README, so we can just merge this, but it has no meaning if we don't actually follow up, that's what I'm trying to say.

350
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:30.869
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, we can merge it, and then we'll do a follow-up. I don't know how we plan on doing the follow-up, but the releases has to be done by someone that has a merging right to the repo.

351
00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:44.149
Felix (Geth): Yes, so we can… with the merging rights, we have to also kind of figure it out in the long term, because Carrie was one of the people with the merge access, but she is not there right now. I mean, Carrie will come back in…

352
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:54.810
Felix (Geth): a few months when her baby is a bit older, but for now, she cannot come. So, that's why, yeah, we have to figure out how to actually…

353
00:44:55.250 --> 00:45:00.240
Felix (Geth): who's gonna be in charge of that. For now, I can just,

354
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:10.290
Felix (Geth): merge this PR in. It does require some updates, because there were some updates to the README in the meantime, but I will quickly…

355
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:12.090
Felix (Geth): make these…

356
00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:21.909
Felix (Geth): updates after the call, and then merge this. But it… yeah, it's not the… the merging is not the end. You have to figure out the… the real… the real strategy.

357
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:32.430
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I guess I'll have to, like, add, a further up discussion on this in our next call, next two weeks.

358
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:49.539
Chase Wright: Yeah, that's fine. I can talk to Patches internally, too, and I can hook… I can link you up with Patches, in Discord, because I think Patches wants to do the work around, merging the…

359
00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:53.310
Chase Wright: The test generator into the specs.

360
00:45:53.310 --> 00:46:08.619
Felix (Geth): Yeah, yeah, we should actually mention this. This might be a good time to mention this. So, we have decided internally that the next step forward actually will be to move the RPC testgen into this repository as well, into the execution APIs repository. And the reason for that is mostly that

361
00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.180
Felix (Geth): we…

362
00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:18.809
Felix (Geth): When we make changes to the test, it's not obvious that they have to be made in the generator, and also the generator and the test output is kind of…

363
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:28.549
Felix (Geth): similar, and in the long run, we don't actually need to keep the generated tests as part of the repository, they are just in the repository right now, because

364
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:35.680
Felix (Geth): It's easier, but, in the long run, we can also just keep the generator there, and then the

365
00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:49.499
Felix (Geth): generate the test for each release of the specification, and then attach them as an artifact, or things like that. We have to figure out the precise details, but that's kind of what I meant. It's like, yes, we want the versioning, but there is more to this, and Patches agreed to work on this, so he will…

366
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:54.649
Felix (Geth): Perform these changes, and also figure out the build process a bit better, and things like that.

367
00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:00.270
Felix (Geth): So it's just… there's gonna be some ongoing work in the repository regard… related with this…

368
00:47:04.210 --> 00:47:05.980
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, that sounds good.

369
00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:14.530
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Moving on to the agenda post, like, we are running out of time. We have some open issues on call to standardize, debug my thoughts, and then…

370
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:22.939
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: add block timestamp to each cat's transaction by hash, and then to fully implement EIP1898.

371
00:47:23.870 --> 00:47:25.880
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Let me share the links…

372
00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.079
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I don't know if you have any…

373
00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.949
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Further discussion on this. Although, I'm not seeing a champion for EIP1898.

374
00:47:50.330 --> 00:47:52.690
Felix (Geth): What?

375
00:47:56.770 --> 00:48:04.929
Felix (Geth): Oh yeah, okay, so this is about adding the block timestamp. Yes, so, regarding the issue number 729,

376
00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:12.489
Felix (Geth): The way this happened is that we had a user request this feature in Geth.

377
00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:28.280
Felix (Geth): And as usual, when people request features in RPC, we directed him to this repository, so now he is here in Execution APIs, and then I added the triage tag so that we would look at this. The thing is that…

378
00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.470
Felix (Geth): we…

379
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:37.609
Felix (Geth): I don't know, like, this is just something we have to decide on. We made the same change for ETH get logs.

380
00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:46.180
Felix (Geth): So EthgetLogs now returns the block timestamp in each log, and we did that because people requested it.

381
00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:54.450
Felix (Geth): it's hard to say if this is useful or not, I just wanted to bring it up here in case anyone has an opinion about it.

382
00:48:56.310 --> 00:48:57.949
Felix (Geth): It's a new feature.

383
00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.209
Felix (Geth): In the API, so we have to judge it somehow.

384
00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.339
Felix (Geth): Just to make it short, you guys know, I'm talking about issue number 729.

385
00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:13.729
Felix (Geth): Which is called…

386
00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:24.500
Felix (Geth): add block timestamp to ETH get transaction by hash. So inside of the output of each transaction, they want to know what was the block timestamp containing this transaction.

387
00:49:27.130 --> 00:49:28.790
Felix (Geth): Why they want that?

388
00:49:29.180 --> 00:49:30.289
Felix (Geth): Hard to say.

389
00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:36.000
Felix (Geth): They're saying here that it decreases latency in the access.

390
00:49:36.260 --> 00:49:38.219
Felix (Geth): In certain use cases.

391
00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:46.939
Chase Wright: Yeah, I think they're just… they're complaining that, basically, they need to make two calls, right? If they want to know.

392
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:49.019
Chase Wright: The timestamp of the block.

393
00:49:49.030 --> 00:49:50.130
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, yeah, exactly.

394
00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.710
Chase Wright: Then they have to make another call, so it's…

395
00:49:53.170 --> 00:50:00.569
Chase Wright: it's in increased latency, and, you know, from an RPC perspective, it's another call, API credit, whatever they…

396
00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.860
Chase Wright: complaining about.

397
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:03.920
Felix (Geth): Yo.

398
00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:12.199
Chase Wright: I'm not opposed to it, I think it's fine.

399
00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:14.390
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, I think it's fine as well, I'm not opposed.

400
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:21.119
Felix (Geth): Okay, in that case, please add your input to this issue. If you can, just say that

401
00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:40.809
Felix (Geth): make a statement there that, you support it, and for Tulio, you can also add that you are the Aragon developer, it will definitely help with this. I do think we need to get more input from other clients, so we have to either wait until they come on this call, or somehow solicit it from them in another way.

402
00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:49.850
Felix (Geth): But basically, it… currently, I would say this issue is in the input-gathering stage. And I will also add my comment here, saying that

403
00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:53.769
Felix (Geth): That there are no objections.

404
00:50:56.690 --> 00:51:03.149
Felix (Geth): to adding it from Geth. So that's… I think this is about as much as we can do for this right now.

405
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.700
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I'm not…

406
00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:14.800
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I don't have the technical details of the issue, but, like, does it have, like, an adverse technical effect? Because that's another thing…

407
00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:23.529
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: we need to keep in mind. So I'm not sure if it has any ambiguity to it that will make, other client teams not so want to implement it.

408
00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:29.990
Felix (Geth): I don't think so, because in practice, it's like, they… I mean, depends how they have implemented get transaction by hatch, it's actually a good point.

409
00:51:30.310 --> 00:51:43.489
Felix (Geth): In GoEthereum, it's quite easy to add it, because in order to service the ETH get transaction by hash, we load anyway the block header. So it's like, we have the block header available while we are serving this.

410
00:51:43.490 --> 00:52:00.109
Felix (Geth): And so this means we will always be able to return the timestamp of the block quite easily. However, there are other clients that may implement this thing very differently, and they might not actually have access to the block timestamp. They would have an extra database load internally to serve this

411
00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:10.219
Felix (Geth): information. And yeah, that is something that they would have to then bring up as an argument, where they're saying, yeah, this will slow down ETH get transaction by hash.

412
00:52:10.610 --> 00:52:15.370
Felix (Geth): In Geth, it's like, we have to load this anyway, so for us, it's free.

413
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:25.089
Tullio | Erigon: Or as it is not, but… Yeah, that's… I mean,

414
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:35.040
Tullio | Erigon: I see some value from the user point of view, so I think that that should be taken into consideration.

415
00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:47.129
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, okay, I think I'll have to, like, drop a link for this to ACDE, if that is okay.

416
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:55.140
Chase Wright: Yeah.

417
00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:55.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello?

418
00:52:57.970 --> 00:53:02.430
Chase Wright: Yeah, we can ask in the next, testing for? Excuse me.

419
00:53:02.430 --> 00:53:03.120
Felix (Geth): Okay.

420
00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:05.969
Felix (Geth): Yeah, well, let's do this. Sounds great.

421
00:53:06.090 --> 00:53:14.500
Felix (Geth): then we can make some progress. The other… we… I… we can quickly discuss the other issues. So there is, issue number 713.

422
00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:20.699
Felix (Geth): 713 is about the EIP 1898.

423
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:22.819
Felix (Geth): And,

424
00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:34.880
Felix (Geth): EIP… this… we discovered this recently, so I discovered this issue in December 5th, and that's when I opened it, in the… in the specs. So, it just turns out that…

425
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:47.290
Felix (Geth): we… this… EIP is final, and it says that for certain methods, you can… supply…

426
00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:53.529
Felix (Geth): Basically, for most methods where you can right now supply the block number, you can also give

427
00:53:53.700 --> 00:54:00.529
Felix (Geth): an object containing the field block hash, and another field called require canonical.

428
00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:10.409
Felix (Geth): I wasn't even aware of this feature, but then we found out that Geth does support this, because it was originally implemented in Geth.

429
00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:19.909
Felix (Geth): Around the time when this was added, and this was in 2019. So this… at this point, it is more than 6 years ago.

430
00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:29.749
Felix (Geth): So, yeah, I don't know, how to move forward. I guess I could just create some tests, but I was just…

431
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:46.909
Felix (Geth): wondering if this is supported at all in clients, or if everyone is aware of this EIP, because honestly, it was kind of a bit… like, I was surprised myself to see this, so I'm pretty sure not a lot of people are aware this feature even exists right now. And it's not in the spec.

432
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:56.260
Felix (Geth): So what's the action here? Like, should we just add it to the spec? Because this EIP is final, so, like, from a process point of view, we have to have this.

433
00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:07.449
Felix (Geth): Yeah. On the other hand, it seems kind of like following the EIPs religiously was never really our thing in RPC, so… it's hard to say…

434
00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:12.480
Felix (Geth): I'm pretty sure if we add a test for this, then some clients are gonna fail that test.

435
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:33.630
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, probably, but on the other hand, I think we have this lock number or hash or tag in some endpoints, or already. I cannot recall them off top of my head, but for sure, some endpoints already do support this

436
00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.019
Tullio | Erigon: block number, or hash, or tag. Probably if get logs, or…

437
00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:57.769
Felix (Geth): That's kind of a good point. So the thing is that they also… they… this EIP also specifies an error code, which is pretty interesting. So it has this… it has a recommended error code minus 32,001, which is supposed to be raised if

438
00:56:00.330 --> 00:56:08.850
Felix (Geth): It's supposed to be raised if you specify require canonical, but the block which is given is non-canonical.

439
00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:10.480
Felix (Geth): And…

440
00:56:11.010 --> 00:56:24.470
Felix (Geth): I mean, this is… this is, like, too clever by half, I would say. Like, yes, it's a good feature, but I am doubtful any app uses this, because it's just too clever right now. I mean, I'm not aware anyone's using this, honestly.

441
00:56:24.810 --> 00:56:30.790
Felix (Geth): And they want it everywhere you can give the block number, so, like, ETH getBalance, ETH…

442
00:56:31.330 --> 00:56:41.389
Felix (Geth): getStorage at, and things like that. And the intention behind this is that when you are querying for historical storage or balances.

443
00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:58.320
Felix (Geth): you can… the idea is that you would first resolve the block number that you want to a hash, and then you can make all your further queries with this hash, but you can be sure that the block is still canonical while you're making the request. So…

444
00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:05.810
Felix (Geth): I… honestly, I'm just not sure if this… I mean, okay, yeah, having the ability to specify a block hash is good.

445
00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:09.260
Felix (Geth): But this require canonical thing, honestly.

446
00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:14.779
Felix (Geth): I'm not sure if this is really… we can… I mean, I can add the test and check, but just want

447
00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:15.929
Felix (Geth): your heads updated.

448
00:57:15.930 --> 00:57:28.550
Chase Wright: So I can give you some insight as to why that this is a good feature, and that is when you… so, historically, when, like, at QuickNode, when we ran…

449
00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:37.029
Chase Wright: you know, super fast chains like Matic, where they would have large and regular reoccurring reorgs.

450
00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:46.499
Chase Wright: clients like Aragon, would be able to return the forked blocks very easily. So, you know.

451
00:57:46.500 --> 00:57:54.670
Chase Wright: A lot of, like, people would be asking for blocks by hash all the time, and then there'd be a reorg that would occur.

452
00:57:54.670 --> 00:58:06.940
Chase Wright: And if the clients didn't catch it, then we would be returning those… we would be returning those blocks from… from Aragon or whatever, and the client wouldn't know, like, oh, hey, this is a fork. So…

453
00:58:06.990 --> 00:58:10.410
Chase Wright: By having required canonical true.

454
00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:25.320
Chase Wright: if it was working, and Aragon, you know, understood that, then even though that block had been forked out and been reorged, Aragon would then just not return it. So I think it is a good feature, it has use cases,

455
00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:31.000
Felix (Geth): It definitely has use cases, I fully agree. This… it's… I mean, I think it's an amazing feature, it's just…

456
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:43.249
Felix (Geth): is this supported by client libraries? I have no idea. Is it supported by the clients themselves? I have no idea. This is just a good idea that basically just ended up… someone implemented it, I guess has it, but…

457
00:58:44.070 --> 00:58:44.940
Felix (Geth): I…

458
00:58:45.450 --> 00:58:52.109
Felix (Geth): I wasn't aware Geth has this, and I'm supposed to know, so it's kind of… it's a very deep…

459
00:58:52.390 --> 00:59:04.779
Felix (Geth): I just wanted to bring this up here in this call, because I think it's perfect for this call, but I don't think we're gonna make a decision. So I can… I think we can all agree, would be nice to have some tests for this, and that's really all I wanted to say here, is that…

460
00:59:05.510 --> 00:59:06.559
Felix (Geth): Yeah, but…

461
00:59:06.560 --> 00:59:06.880
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah.

462
00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:13.820
Chase Wright: To your point, there's the… like, we don't… the generator, it doesn't even support, like, uncles and stuff, does it?

463
00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:22.200
Felix (Geth): I mean, that's something we can add, so that's the thing, we can add it in a way where, like, we can have…

464
00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:32.960
Felix (Geth): This is something we have to figure out independently in our testing setup, how to add side chains in a deterministic way, so we can make this query happen.

465
00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:46.970
Felix (Geth): But either way, what I mostly meant is, like, even passing this information to the client is half the battle, right? If we would just pass them this parameter and see if they can even parse it on all the methods where it is supposed to apply.

466
00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:52.530
Felix (Geth): I think that would be the first step, because I'm pretty sure they might not be able to handle it right now.

467
00:59:56.310 --> 01:00:04.910
Felix (Geth): So that's the thing, it's like, first step would be just add some tests where this parameter is present, like, doesn't really matter if it's required, canonical, true, or false.

468
01:00:05.110 --> 01:00:09.820
Felix (Geth): The… the clients might… not… accept this input.

469
01:00:10.050 --> 01:00:16.079
Felix (Geth): And then, somehow, we also have to figure out how to make the client have a sidechain.

470
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:27.060
Felix (Geth): and store that sideshade. But that is not trivial… like, that's a different kind of thing, like, we have to change the Hive Runner for this, and…

471
01:00:28.330 --> 01:00:30.939
Felix (Geth): Yeah, well, we have to figure that out, but it's…

472
01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.049
Felix (Geth): like, I see this more, like, as the next step.

473
01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.890
Chase Wright: Sounds like a backlog item.

474
01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:46.750
Felix (Geth): Yeah, that's more like a backlog item, yes, that's correct. It's just more that, like, ultimately we have to… I was more thinking we should add some tests.

475
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.910
Felix (Geth): that…

476
01:00:48.310 --> 01:00:56.690
Felix (Geth): We'll call it with this input, and then see if they even parse it, or if they will fail and say that it's an invalid parameter or something.

477
01:00:58.210 --> 01:01:10.480
Chase Wright: Yeah, I mean, we… it wouldn't really… I mean, it would tell us if they are strictly enforcing the keys in the object, but it wouldn't tell us if they are parsing it or not.

478
01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:19.540
Chase Wright: Because they're either gonna return an error saying, like, I don't know what that key is, or they're gonna ignore it, and if they ignore it, we wouldn't know anyway.

479
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:35.460
Felix (Geth): Yeah, that's true, that's true. We wouldn't catch that, but I'm pretty sure since this… one of the things about it is that, in order to even pass this, you have to pass a JSON object in place where you usually pass a string. So I'm pretty sure that if they support a JSON object in that place.

480
01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.229
Felix (Geth): They have to have some handling for this, because the only reason why you would pass an object is because of this field.

481
01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:50.339
Felix (Geth): it's… yeah, I mean, we have to re… it just… it requires some research. I just wanted to bring it up for us to have a, you know.

482
01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:52.629
Felix (Geth): We wouldn't necessarily have talked about it.

483
01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:09.550
Felix (Geth): Okay, and then… do we have another item here? 651, standardized debug methods. So, I think…

484
01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:20.240
Felix (Geth): Yeah, this is just a survey of the different error behaviors of, the debug methods.

485
01:02:20.610 --> 01:02:24.800
Felix (Geth): I think we just have to check if the tests cover this.

486
01:02:25.110 --> 01:02:26.630
Felix (Geth): And,

487
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:40.620
Felix (Geth): If the… if the RPC Compact tests do cover this, then we're fine, and this issue can be closed. It's just more about… they are basically… they basically surveyed how the clients behave in the case of certain inputs.

488
01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:45.999
Felix (Geth): In Issue 651.

489
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.770
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I think I'll check that out and then get back to you.

490
01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:56.440
Felix (Geth): Okay.

491
01:02:56.860 --> 01:03:02.860
Felix (Geth): Okay, maybe… I know we are out of time, but I quickly wanted to add…

492
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:08.990
Felix (Geth): There is also, pull request 707.

493
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.840
Felix (Geth): I will drop the link.

494
01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:24.250
Felix (Geth): which I wanted to just ask if we can merge. So, the, I have already created the tests for this pull request and updated it.

495
01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:29.240
Felix (Geth): The pull request 707 adds… the method NETVERSION

496
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:36.810
Felix (Geth): into the specification, and this is a very widely supported method, so I think it should be fine to add it.

497
01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.769
Chase Wright: I agree.

498
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So… Okay.

499
01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:44.369
Felix (Geth): So… This is… this is something that is always

500
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:46.470
Felix (Geth): Yeah, and people are using it, yeah.

501
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:47.160
Tullio | Erigon: January.

502
01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:47.770
Felix (Geth): book.

503
01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:50.060
Felix (Geth): Cool.

504
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:56.280
Felix (Geth): So, I will just… the tests are already created, so this is very easy, so I will just merge it.

505
01:03:56.490 --> 01:03:58.969
Felix (Geth): Thank you, guys, this was interesting.

506
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:05.970
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you, everyone. I guess our next call will be on…

507
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:09.880
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Next two weeks from now, and we can, like,

508
01:04:10.830 --> 01:04:17.100
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Go back to the, versioning issue and also the debug.

509
01:04:17.630 --> 01:04:20.940
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Plus, I also have some tests I wanted to,

510
01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:25.990
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: point out, but that will be next two weeks. I will do it on the Discord.

511
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.430
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: See you guys next week, thanks for joining.

512
01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:35.979
Chase Wright: I have… I have RPC standards on my calendar for the 19th, which is next Monday. Do we need to get the calendar fixed?

513
01:04:37.750 --> 01:04:46.039
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: it's always… like, this is the first call of the month… of the year we are having, so I think there's a misop. We're supposed to have it,

514
01:04:46.790 --> 01:04:54.389
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: This call was supposed to happen last Monday, but since it was too early, it was this Monday, so I think that's where the mess-up started.

515
01:04:55.130 --> 01:05:01.130
Chase Wright: Alright, I'll bug Nixo or something, because my calendar says it's next week.

516
01:05:01.130 --> 01:05:02.589
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, we have to… Okay.

517
01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:03.330
Chase Wright: Alright.

518
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.729
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, sorry about that.

519
01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:08.069
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Alright, thank you for joining. Thank you very much.

520
01:05:08.070 --> 01:05:10.319
Tullio | Erigon: Okay. Thank you all. Goodbye.
