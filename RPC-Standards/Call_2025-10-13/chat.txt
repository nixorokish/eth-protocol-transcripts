00:07:59	Ben Adams:	Issue bot is using different meeting link
00:14:34	Łukasz Rozmej:	IMO you need tests to show them they are not complying to standard
00:19:52	FLCL:	can be additional separate namespaces like core or zk, to make it clearer

00:23:16	Bumblefudge:	^ I would also mention that wallets and dapps need some amount of namespaces for errors between them
00:24:13	Bumblefudge:	(mostly out of scope here, but just mentioned it in case anyone proposes a convention for diff categories of error)
00:24:19	FLCL:	zk-transactioncore-transactionreserve a namespace in a pr and get a range like we do with eips
00:25:00	Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari:	Replying to "zk-transaction
core-..."

Could you please expand more on this?
00:26:42	FLCL:	Replying to "zk-transactioncore-..."

Just thinking about how could be simpler for everyone to reserve and name error code ranges. Could be a pr template, prs are discussed during a meeting like the current one

00:33:41	Barnabas:	most of the time its that easy
00:33:54	Barnabas:	the hard part is getting everyone on the call/actually go through them

00:35:13	Justin Florentine (Besu):	sort of. gettin a pr into a spec merged is the harder part.

00:35:55	Barnabas:	Replying to "sort of. gettin a pr..."

00:39:42	FLCL:	There was mention of a requirement of way more tests for rpc. Can we cover one specific endpoint with what could be ideal coverage
00:39:53	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "sort of. gettin a pr..."

who all has maintainer access on this repo?

Lightclient  fjl
00:40:55	Simsonraj Easvarasakthi:	Replying to "There was mention of..."

Yea thats my next goal, will be writing some tests to simulate the negative cases against different clients

00:46:50	Bumblefudge:	@Sebastian Bürgel [Gnosis/HOPR] does this feel like useful first-steps or orthogonal to what you were asking about?
00:47:28	FLCL:	what's graphql
00:47:34	Bumblefudge:	Reacted to "what's graphql" with 🙃
00:48:10	Justin Florentine (Besu):	Replying to "what's graphql"

besu has gql but nobody uses it
00:49:35	FLCL:	Reacted to "besu has gql but nob..." with 🥲
00:50:38	FLCL:	Replying to "what's graphql"

so it all sounds like we just need to agree on json rpc and improve it to perfection
00:50:53	Bumblefudge:	Reacted to "so it all sounds lik..." with 🤝
00:50:53	Simsonraj Easvarasakthi:	Replying to "can be additional se..."

that sounds like a good idea, will try and add that space
00:51:28	Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari:	Replying to "what's graphql"

Yes, and also for clients teams to join in this calls
00:51:46	Simsonraj Easvarasakthi:	Replying to "zk-transaction
core-..."

yea, I think having a separate zk space, seems like a good idea, I can try that in this proposal
