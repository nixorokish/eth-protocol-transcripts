00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.970
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello.

2
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:49.490
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Good afternoon.

3
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:55.250
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh… Okay, Akash, you're ready.

4
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.549
Akash | ECH: Yep, we are live.

5
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.100
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank you.

6
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.029
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Good afternoon, welcome to ROPC Core Standard Call 16.

7
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.830
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: today's date, December 8th, 2025. We don't have much done on the agenda, but…

8
00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.329
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think, Carrie, you shh,

9
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:30.959
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sims is not here, the first, which is JSON ROPC error code standardization. Since he's not here to update us on that front, I think we can go over to the execution API versioning.

10
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.539
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: by Curry.

11
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:41.780
keri: Sure, that sounds good. Let's see, I can drop a link in the chat…

12
00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.299
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Let me shop that.

13
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:45.130
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

14
00:04:46.290 --> 00:05:04.520
keri: Oh, you got it, okay. So basically what I want to do, and what I think would help client developers, is to, have versioning information in execution APIs, and this is mostly for, the Hive specs, so that they can start passing the Hive,

15
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.270
keri: the RPC Compact.

16
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:17.460
keri: hive tests, so they're not trying to hit a moving target, because basically right now, anytime something gets merged, a hive test breaks somewhere along the way. So…

17
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:24.080
keri: I have some comments here. I have addressed the feedback, I tagged…

18
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.910
keri: Felix to see if he had any other,

19
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.839
keri: feedback, I'll probably give it a couple more days.

20
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:42.840
keri: And then, merge it in, and then get something up in Hive where we can run against the… both the version.

21
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.269
keri: The tagged version, and then also, like,

22
00:05:46.410 --> 00:06:00.889
keri: like, an unstable version, so that clients can see what's coming down the line. But if there are any client developers here who have opinions, or anything like that, or feedback, let me know, or feel free to comment on the PR as well.

23
00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.520
keri: I don't have any other updates there besides that.

24
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.660
keri: So that's it from my end.

25
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:18.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, that's good. I wanted to also point out something about, Boom.

26
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.799
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: But I was hoping Sims and,

27
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:27.759
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: this other guy would be here, because I think they're the ones majorly in charge of OpenROPC.

28
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:43.809
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: to talk about, proper documentation and also the website on its own, because I feel like we… there's some things that are not in the website already, and I would actually like for us to talk about how we will make,

29
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:49.239
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: The website much more proper, and then to align very well with

30
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.360
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: also with, the open ROPC.

31
00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:58.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: But I… I'm not seeing them here, although I tagged them on Discord, so…

32
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.230
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Maybe we can keep that out for… the next call.

33
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.580
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: What do you think?

34
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:19.939
keri: Yeah, that sounds good to me. I know Zane, is working… Zane with OpenRPC is working on, making the site a lot nicer, and should have…

35
00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:30.400
keri: something coming in on the 24th, I think. They have a grant deadline for the EF, so they should have something around then to share.

36
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.010
keri: As well, so…

37
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.679
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay, I wasn't aware of any upcoming, enhancements, but that's okay.

38
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:50.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think that's all we have on our agenda. So, if you have anything you want us to discuss, about the ROPC,

39
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.480
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: or the repo, or any open PRs also.

40
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.639
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Please, the floor is yours.

41
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:21.690
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay, I guess we don't have any other thing. Then, I will also like to point out some open PRs, especially the ones we have that have been installed for a very long time.

42
00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:25.420
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I will leave that to you, Kira.

43
00:08:28.030 --> 00:08:32.070
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: It's… is there, like, any possible feedback for this?

44
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.420
keri: Do you have ones that you're thinking about specifically?

45
00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:45.039
keri: I want to, I'd really like to get this versioning in first, because,

46
00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:49.669
keri: you know, once we start adding stuff, it'll start breaking the RPC compact tests again.

47
00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:55.880
keri: So that's kind of what I have been waiting on, but, but if there are…

48
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.639
keri: Specific ones that you want.

49
00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:01.290
keri: I mean, to take a look, I can definitely do that.

50
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.249
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'm trying to drop them on the chart.

51
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:07.610
keri: Okay, perfect.

52
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:17.989
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And, okay, for the… since, Sims is not here, but if anyone has any,

53
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:26.280
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: points about the JSON ROPC error code standardization, that is ongoing? Like, any…

54
00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:33.940
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: improvements or suggestions. This is the PR. We can leave our comments there.

55
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.089
keri: Cool. Do you know, has anything changed in the JSON IPC error codes?

56
00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:07.690
keri: PR.

57
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.000
keri: Major?

58
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.439
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: No, not… nothing has been changed yet. There's… it's still, like.

59
00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:23.670
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the last time we left it, so I'm saying… because our last discussion, we were supposed to, like, move over to the ACDT call to get more client views on it, but…

60
00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:34.639
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I did not hear from Sims, so I was expecting if we… if I'm able to get back or get in contact with him before this week, we can move it over to ACDT.

61
00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:36.879
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Next week, Monday.

62
00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:46.519
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We can add it to the agenda, so that if any improvement or for that suggestion, we can also align it properly.

63
00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:52.439
keri: Cool. Yeah, and I think, I think it'd be good to get it on the ACDT.

64
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:57.860
keri: call next week, even though, it looks like Simpson has,

65
00:10:59.070 --> 00:11:02.020
keri: Address some of the comments already, so…

66
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:13.430
keri: I would say let's get it on the call on the agenda next Monday, and then hopefully we can either get more feedback or… or, move towards merging it.

67
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:20.389
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yes, and that was… I think, I saw a comment about…

68
00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:24.039
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: One of the error codes, I can't remember where, I think it's on this code.

69
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:27.159
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And now I can access my Discord.

70
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.430
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, about, it gets log error.

71
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.539
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Let me just drop the links to the trade.

72
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:51.400
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, is this something we need to take a look at?

73
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.669
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, we need to add to the agenda also.

74
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.560
keri: That's a good question. I'm not sure. I can…

75
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:16.179
keri: Take a look. I sort of think, Felix might have merged this one.

76
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:18.740
keri: But I can double check.

77
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:22.669
keri: And see if a response is needed, or if we need to, put it on…

78
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:24.360
keri: One of the agendas.

79
00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:31.519
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, like, I was thinking this should be also be part of the error audition and the error codes we were working on.

80
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.800
keri: Yeah, I think it should.

81
00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

82
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:37.780
keri: Yeah.

83
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:49.549
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: That is from my end. I don't know if… Any other PIN?

84
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:58.660
keri: Nothing for my end.

85
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:17.069
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so, wheelsen, Chase, Katya, Nikitas… I'm sorry if I pronounced your name wrongly. Do you have any…

86
00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:21.020
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: any imputes for this call before we call it a day?

87
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:33.020
Chase Wright: I guess I can say hello. I'm Chase. I just joined the EF, and my responsibilities are around node infrastructure and RPC stuff.

88
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:44.360
Chase Wright: So, this is my first time joining the call, so I'm kind of just listening in, getting a feel for what you guys are doing before I try to have any opinions on anything.

89
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.850
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you for joining us. Thank you, Katya.

90
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:54.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so that's basically… All for today.

91
00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.589
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I guess we'll have to come again on… next week… next two weeks, rather.

92
00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.769
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay, sorry.

93
00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:06.530
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: You can unmute.

94
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:15.100
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, hi guys, I'm from Nethermine team. I'm working on RPC compatibility now, and…

95
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.170
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, I wanted just to discuss a few, guest internal

96
00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.449
Nikita Meshcheriakov: issues that we face in Nethermind.

97
00:14:23.890 --> 00:14:27.250
Nikita Meshcheriakov: I probably need to talk to someone from guest team.

98
00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:38.330
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so the idea of this call is to convey any information or to discuss anything pertaining to JSON ROPC.

99
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:47.979
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: we can have a broader discussion, and then we… we might… if there is no time left, we can still continue on the Discord.

100
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.229
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the JSNRP6 channel.

101
00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.599
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, I will raise Dish on Discord.

102
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:59.770
Nikita Meshcheriakov: I talked to Felix about it, but, on number…

103
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.450
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, can you make an intro about it? Can you, like…

104
00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:13.939
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yes, so, it's an issue with transaction types, so inside the Geth ignores them, and Nethermine doesn't, so we…

105
00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.510
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Check transaction types on RPC calls.

106
00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.920
Nikita Meshcheriakov: And, like… Act.

107
00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:23.079
Nikita Meshcheriakov: According to transaction type.

108
00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.430
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, that's the issue.

109
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:34.600
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, kira, do you have anything to say to this?

110
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.050
keri: Okay, sorry, can you summarize that one more time? I didn't understand.

111
00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:48.549
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yes, so, for example, when you do it call, guess, and put transaction type, in transaction.

112
00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:52.840
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Guess we'll ignore it, just remove from JSON.

113
00:15:52.960 --> 00:16:00.679
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Entirely. But in never mind, we will use this transaction type and execute transaction as transaction of this type.

114
00:16:02.510 --> 00:16:08.220
keri: Gotcha. Does that come out in the, JSON RPC? Like, what comes back, or…

115
00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:16.130
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, for example, like, if you put, like, transaction type 2 and bloep hashes.

116
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:23.729
Nikita Meshcheriakov: gas will treat this as a blob transaction, and Nethermind will treat this as 15598P transaction.

117
00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:24.990
keri: Okay.

118
00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:37.099
keri: Yeah, I think, unfortunately, yeah, I think the channel would be the best place to bring that up.

119
00:16:37.350 --> 00:16:44.670
keri: with the get devs. One of my longer-term goals is to get, get off of the…

120
00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:49.869
keri: As not the spec, and start using the execution specs repo instead.

121
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.670
keri: But that's… I don't… that won't happen very soon.

122
00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:57.209
keri: But hopefully within the next year.

123
00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:05.520
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, okay, that's actually something else I wanted to discuss, because I think that's where most of the issues come out from, because

124
00:17:05.770 --> 00:17:11.939
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh… if guest… Get is missing something, and… or maybe he's not complying to something.

125
00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:15.290
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: The whole test is kind of flaky at the end of the day.

126
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:18.599
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I… I need to share…

127
00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:32.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I will share a Notion page on Discord. I did make a draft about, such cases alongside, Robocop. I think that was the first issues we looked at at beginning of this year.

128
00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.310
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, we… I'm not sure how we're going to go about it, Paul.

129
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:45.020
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I just wanted to ask, is the spec, is there a test for this, transaction on ROP citation?

130
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:49.649
Nikita Meshcheriakov: no, not really.

131
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.100
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

132
00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:02.370
Chase Wright: Maybe you could write the test that works with Nethermine, and then Geth would have to fix it.

133
00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.559
Nikita Meshcheriakov: Yeah, but,

134
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:13.809
Nikita Meshcheriakov: I'm not sure that we should do, like, never mind. So, maybe Geth is right, maybe no one's right, I don't know.

135
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:16.279
Chase Wright: Yeah, okay, we should answer that question first.

136
00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.840
keri: Yeah, and Geth, the tricky part is that Geth, is the spec.

137
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.290
Chase Wright: Okay, well, you say guest is the spec, but, like, that's not…

138
00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:32.149
Chase Wright: true in so much that the specs were written after Geth.

139
00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:36.959
keri: Right, but they, return the response values.

140
00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:40.100
keri: For any given request. There's a tool that…

141
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:45.809
keri: We… when you put in a JSON IPC request, It goes through GIF.

142
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:48.289
keri: And so whatever comes back is the gap.

143
00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:51.480
keri: Response, which then becomes…

144
00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.070
Chase Wright: Alright, sure, but that's an implementation detail, not getth is the spec.

145
00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.010
keri: Sure.

146
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:12.169
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hey, I think we need to continue the discussion on Discord, because I don't think there's any client… get clientele here.

147
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:19.250
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: That's… I think that's all for today. See you guys next two weeks, probably.

148
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We're having a con next two weeks, right?

149
00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:30.220
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Akira.

150
00:19:30.450 --> 00:19:31.300

00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:34.730
keri: We should have a… we should have one in two weeks, yeah.

152
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.850
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: because I was…

153
00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:42.579
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I think we're entering the holidays, so I don't want to, like, jump into people's, off-season.

154
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.909
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, thank you very much for joining today's call, and…
