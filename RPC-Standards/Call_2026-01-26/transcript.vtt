00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:52.640
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Hello?

2
00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.040
Chase Wright: Hello.

3
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.669
Chase Wright: I think the, testing call is going long.

4
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.060
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, we can just start, and then if anyone joins within…

5
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.800
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Later, then that would be it. Good afternoon, everybody.

6
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.050
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, am I audible? I'm gonna shove on my mic.

7
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.910
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

8
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:40.370
Chase Wright: Yo.

9
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:48.059
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank you Okay, welcome to RPC Standard Call 19, today being 26th January 2026.

10
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.259
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We don't have a lot of things. Let me share the agenda.

11
00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.049
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: what's today's call, but… I don't know if…

12
00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.400
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Pacha is online. I can't… I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing the name correctly.

13
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.240
Chase Wright: I don't think patches is… Even invited to this call.

14
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.990
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay, so… I could talk to him.

15
00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.270
Chase Wright: and I can invite him, but I'm not sure if he's gonna… Join me now.

16
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.099
Chase Wright: He probably won't join today. He can join future calls, maybe.

17
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.529
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: That would be really great, because as of right now, I'm not sure if I understand how the two repos work.

18
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:36.229
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So you can just, like, walk us through on how to import the .io files to… if… I don't know how to say it, but, like.

19
00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:44.859
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: since there is a match, I'm not sure how we're going to, like, do further PRs from now on, so it would be really nice if he…

20
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:57.300
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: will come and then explain a little things, and then if you have any questions, he can clarify us on that, because it's more like a… Yeah, well, it's not really that much different than how it works today, like.

21
00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.730
Chase Wright: RPC Testion lived in LightClient's repo, and so it wasn't in…

22
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:15.150
Chase Wright: like, an Ethereum-owned repo, and it wasn't in this particular repo. And so, RPC Testion is what we use to build the Hive test chain, and then it generates

23
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.460
Chase Wright: those .io files?

24
00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:28.859
Chase Wright: And so his PR is mostly just moving that generator into this repo so that the RPC test generator

25
00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:38.920
Chase Wright: which generates from the Hive chain the tests and the requests and responses into those test files. They're moving it into this repo.

26
00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.490
Chase Wright: So that the test generator

27
00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.800
Chase Wright: And the tests will live in the same… in the same repo, if that makes sense.

28
00:03:49.280 --> 00:04:00.019
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, okay, I understand. What I'm saying is, before now, we do this, we run this command of output directory, and then kind of, like, clone the two ripples, like.

29
00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:12.229
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: in line with each other to do the article directory to put the .io files. So I want to understand if it's still that same way, or we are going to run a different command. Like, I'm not sure if I understand how…

30
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:22.739
Chase Wright: I think you're gonna run the same command, but you're gonna run it from inside the execution API's test generator, and it's gonna just automatically regenerate the tests.

31
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.959
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay. Okay, that makes sense.

32
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.280
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank you.

33
00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.229
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I don't know if you have merging rights yet.

34
00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.730
Chase Wright: I do not.

35
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:39.680
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We usually need, this PR to be merged. There is a broken link on our README.

36
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.860
Zane Starr: Yep.

37
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.310
Chase Wright: That… it is merged. I just clicked on it, and it's 738? It's merged.

38
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.310
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay. It is.

39
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:53.309
Chase Wright: The one that we need to get merged is 733, which is still patches.

40
00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.900
Chase Wright: PR, but it's to fix all of the CI and linter issues that are in the repo.

41
00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.449
Chase Wright: Due to the merge?

42
00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.650
Chase Wright: But your… your playground README is… Merged.

43
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.510
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

44
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:21.040
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And also, this is not yet in the agenda, but we… on our last call, we discussed about some changes on the website.

45
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:26.750
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Thank God Zenny's here. Z?

46
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.240
Zane Starr: Yeah.

47
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:29.260
Zane Starr: I'm here.

48
00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:37.809
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, during the last call, we had a discussion on making some changes in the website, although I couldn't get the entire details, but…

49
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.719
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I don't know if Chase might have something to say in regards to this.

50
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:58.490
Chase Wright: I know what you're talking about, but I don't remember the specific changes. I know one of the changes that, that Felix wanted to see is that the,

51
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:14.179
Chase Wright: The example generator, it is always visible, and it is always consuming space on the… I think it was the right-hand side of the screen, and one of the requests is if we could make that…

52
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:21.690
Chase Wright: Either, like, a… a pull-out, like, a column that we could pull out and hide.

53
00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:25.239
Chase Wright: That was one of them. The… the other…

54
00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.709
Zane Starr: generator? I'm a little bit confused by what you mean by example generator.

55
00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:36.070
Chase Wright: Yeah, I don't… I don't… can we just pull up the website? It's… I don't…

56
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:42.390
Chase Wright: Yeah, there we go. Yeah, this thing on the right, see the request with server URL in the example?

57
00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.059
Chase Wright: We… We kind of feel like that consumes… Too much of the…

58
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.680
Chase Wright: The real estate, if you will.

59
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:57.339
Zane Starr: Oh, you mean the actual interactive…

60
00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.640
Chase Wright: Yes, that thing.

61
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.239
Zane Starr: sites. So, like, that's how you make requests?

62
00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.830
Chase Wright: Yeah.

63
00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:06.950
Zane Starr: So, like, otherwise, like, users aren't gonna be able to, like, sort of test requests?

64
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:13.600
Zane Starr: So, like, if you call to send right now, it would send a request out to any RPC endpoint.

65
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:18.950
Zane Starr: So, like, in the past, there's always been a way for people to… Mike.

66
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.379
Zane Starr: make interactive requests, so…

67
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:29.710
Chase Wright: Yeah, no, I'm not saying we want to get rid of it, I'm just saying, like, if you look at her screen right now.

68
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.750
Zane Starr: Like…

69
00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:35.480
Chase Wright: The, the important content that is in the center. It is…

70
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.520
Chase Wright: too confined. The request thing takes up too much real estate.

71
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:47.070
Chase Wright: I don't even know if… I don't know if it's actually possible, but, like, could the… could that be a hidden…

72
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.370
Chase Wright: Column that expands out, or…

73
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.219
Chase Wright: Can we… can it be moved?

74
00:07:53.910 --> 00:08:01.690
Zane Starr: Yeah, I don't know, we'll… we'll, like, have to think about it a little bit, cause…

75
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.469
Chase Wright: Yeah, that's fine.

76
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.720
Zane Starr: The,

77
00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:16.750
Zane Starr: The issue is, is that, like, okay, so there's the DocuSource plugin, and then that would imply we need, like, some sort of configurable thing, so that way everybody else that consumes the docs generation.

78
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.349
Zane Starr: is then able to do it, but I'll make a note of it.

79
00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.729
Zane Starr: And see what's up.

80
00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:42.039
Chase Wright: Yeah, I mean, it's just… it's just a feature request. Like, we already merged it, because we all agreed this is… this is better, right? Like, we… we agreed this is better, we want this, so we merged it. It's just, like, a kind of a feature request of, like, hey, can we hide this or move it? Because it just consumes so much of the real estate. It makes reading the content in the middle

81
00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:43.099
Chase Wright: more difficult.

82
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.680
Zane Starr: Very good.

83
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:52.389
Chase Wright: And then, Mercy, can you go to one of the other APIs that has, like, multiple parameters for inputs? Like…

84
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.850
Chase Wright: Maybe go to ETH Call or something?

85
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:01.149
Chase Wright: Is it even in there? I don't know

86
00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:05.510
Chase Wright: Go to… go to one of the… yeah.

87
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.450
Chase Wright: Yeah, go to ETHC call.

88
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:14.480
Chase Wright: No, that just requires… No.

89
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.980
Chase Wright: I don't remember which one we were… we were looking at.

90
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.749
Chase Wright: Can you share the link to this page in the chat?

91
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.840
Chase Wright: So… I don't have any of my bookmarks.

92
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.119
Chase Wright: Thank you.

93
00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:20.609
Chase Wright: I can't remember… what the other complaint was. It had something to do with the parameters.

94
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:28.899
Zane Starr: I can make one comment on the parameters.

95
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:37.540
Zane Starr: So, actually, there are a few bugs within the spec itself. I think, like, EF Simulate, for instance, doesn't actually have

96
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:39.780
Zane Starr: proper JSON schema.

97
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:40.810
Chase Wright: Okay.

98
00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.150
Zane Starr: it actually violates JSON schema?

99
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:57.079
Zane Starr: So, there are a couple RPC endpoints in which things won't render properly, so, like, I would keep that in mind. So, OpenRPC team is also working on a linter.

100
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:03.599
Zane Starr: That we're planning to, like, integrate into the repo, which should help catch all of these different, like…

101
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:08.389
Zane Starr: smaller JSON schema issues that then, like, sort of manifest.

102
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:12.670
Zane Starr: So you see how it says, like, payload undefined required?

103
00:11:12.930 --> 00:11:19.110
Zane Starr: That's because there's a bug with eSimulate that doesn't specify, like, arrayed items properly.

104
00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.690
Zane Starr: So it's just literally not JSON schema.

105
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:33.970
Chase Wright: Okay, yeah, I think that the complaint that I think Felix brought up was that… so, like, this is parameters, but then, like, this line right here doesn't…

106
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:36.400
Chase Wright: It's kind of awkward, because, like.

107
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:52.139
Chase Wright: the line doesn't mean OR, you know what I mean? Like, this doesn't mean OR. So, like, you're saying, like, payload is required, and then block tag, but, like, is this an AND? Is this an OR? Like, I don't…

108
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.550
Chase Wright: I can't tell.

109
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.550
Zane Starr: So there's some confusion around.

110
00:11:57.550 --> 00:11:59.150
Chase Wright: Just the, just the formatting?

111
00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:00.480
Zane Starr: begin and end?

112
00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:05.320
Chase Wright: Yeah, well, like, here's parameters, and then obviously there's a result, but then, like.

113
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.740
Chase Wright: There are 3 options, but then…

114
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.600
Chase Wright: Like, block number, block tag, block hash…

115
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:21.949
Chase Wright: it's kind of… but then it's just, like, payload, and then a line, and then block tag, and then align. I don't know, it's just… it's not…

116
00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:29.539
Chase Wright: overly obvious to someone coming in, looking at it, and being like, wait, what are the… what are these parameters? What does this line mean?

117
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:42.399
Zane Starr: Maybe, get transaction by block hash and index is easier to, like, view that by? Because, like, Eve Simulate, like I said, has, like, a weird bug, so there could be multiple rendering issues with that.

118
00:12:42.930 --> 00:12:43.960
Chase Wright: Sorry, which one?

119
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:53.339
Zane Starr: Maybe try get transaction by block hash and index? Just something that has multiple parameters,

120
00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:57.379
Zane Starr: That, I think, is not, cooked.

121
00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:58.730
Zane Starr: Okay.

122
00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.290
Zane Starr: So… da-da-da… Sure.

123
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:05.850
Chase Wright: So it requires a block.

124
00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:09.889
Chase Wright: And then there's a line, and then it requires transaction.

125
00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:11.410
Zane Starr: Yeah.

126
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.310
Chase Wright: Index.

127
00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.250
Chase Wright: I mean…

128
00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.240
Zane Starr: It's not a huge deal, it's just a weird…

129
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.360
Chase Wright: Yeah. It's just a… it's just a weird formatting, you know, and it's kind of confusing.

130
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:31.859
Chase Wright: when… You look at it, but it's… I mean, it's not a huge deal.

131
00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:34.050
Zane Starr: Okay.

132
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:45.710
Zane Starr: And then, like, I think I might have missed this in the earlier call, you were talking about doing a merge of the RPC testgen into…

133
00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:50.620
Zane Starr: the execution APIs, Rebo?

134
00:13:50.860 --> 00:14:02.829
Chase Wright: Yes, yes, that's correct. So it's already been merged, but merging it introduced some weird, like, linter and CI failures. So there's a PR733,

135
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:08.630
Chase Wright: For… for that, but we need someone who can actually,

136
00:14:09.510 --> 00:14:12.810
Chase Wright: review and merge, because I can't do that.

137
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.280
Chase Wright: So yeah, the RPC test generator.

138
00:14:16.390 --> 00:14:29.649
Chase Wright: which used to live out in LightClient's repo. That has been merged into execution APIs now. So, it's under, tools, so Execution APIs Tools. We now have the spec check tool.

139
00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.760
Chase Wright: And, and the generator?

140
00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.100
Zane Starr: Okay, cool, cool.

141
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:50.910
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you. Moving forward, I want to also point this out. If there's any other clients in there that hasn't signaled on this.

142
00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.010
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Issue.

143
00:14:52.210 --> 00:15:00.469
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Think Besu, Aragon, and GET has signaled, so if NetherMind and any other clients

144
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:02.239
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I would also like to…

145
00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:12.779
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: look, I would also want to encourage us to look at this issue in case there's something that is off, or we need to be aware of, or it's a go-ahead from every person.

146
00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:20.169
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: that issue… 7 to 9. I shared the link on the chat.

147
00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:28.330
Chase Wright: Yeah, I don't… I don't think anyone is probably gonna object, I think.

148
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:37.349
Chase Wright: And… Geth has the, an open PR for it. Once…

149
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:43.329
Chase Wright: Once that gets merged, then the RPC test gen would then…

150
00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:51.339
Chase Wright: pull from that and would add it to all of the logs for RPC compat testing, so…

151
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:54.440
Chase Wright: Yeah, I think we just need to get…

152
00:15:56.670 --> 00:16:02.330
Chase Wright: We just need to get it merged, and then get the test regenerated, and then… and get the other clients

153
00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.640
Chase Wright: To also implement it.

154
00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:14.270
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, but that should be on hold because of the lint issue we are currently having.

155
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:16.570
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: If I'm not mistaken.

156
00:16:17.330 --> 00:16:24.059
Chase Wright: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we need to get the linter thing fixed, but, I mean, we can work on all this in parallel.

157
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:38.760
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, in… in regards to the linked PR, it's… it's just, like, a way to fast-forward it, because I think, getting hold of all clients would be a difficult task, and I'm not sure of…

158
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:52.800
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Anyone else we can tag to the PR? Or can you get, let's say, imagine rights to the PR? It would be, like, a lot easier for us to match PRs if you have emerging rights.

159
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.370
Chase Wright: Yeah, I mean, I can… It can bug some people.

160
00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:04.940
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you.

161
00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:14.690
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I also have an issue that I created, because I noticed that, some of the Tests.

162
00:17:15.569 --> 00:17:27.749
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Some of the methods are missing out on some tests, this is it. But I still think this is blocked by the links PR, and also, I wanted to ask if…

163
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:37.879
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: writing this test will be a good idea. I'm trying to seek out opinions, if I can go ahead and write the test for this.

164
00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.090
Chase Wright: So…

165
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:58.840
Chase Wright: A lot of these methods are gonna require filters, and there's actually another issue in the execution APIs, where someone was asking for this, but the current problem is that all of the clients return filter IDs.

166
00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:09.309
Chase Wright: that are non-deterministic and even random, and the current test generator, or the current RPC compat thingy.

167
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:15.270
Chase Wright: Doesn't have, a way to deal with non-deterministic

168
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:22.389
Chase Wright: Fields, so we need to work on… Being able to support that.

169
00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:32.800
Chase Wright: I don't know if debug get bad blocks can even be tested via Ive at this point. I'd have to get with

170
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.050
Chase Wright: Felix and… and look at that.

171
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:44.290
Chase Wright: Max priority fee per gas, maybe, and ETH gas price, certainly, we can probably… Write tests for those?

172
00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:49.800
Chase Wright: But the rest of them, anything with a filter in it is gonna require…

173
00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:52.570
Chase Wright: a lot more work, I think.

174
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:58.539
Chase Wright: Well, maybe not a lot, but we need to account for the fact that all of the clients will return

175
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.259
Chase Wright: different ID numbers in a non-deterministic way.

176
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:18.379
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, sorry, but I'm so sorry if I can't pronounce your name, or, F-L-C-L, you said something in the chat, can you please unmute? Thank you.

177
00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:23.380
FLCL: Hello, Survey.

178
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:28.900
FLCL: You are asking about my, comment, right?

179
00:19:29.410 --> 00:19:30.260
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah.

180
00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.979
Chase Wright: Yeah, which one are you talking about?

181
00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:39.580
FLCL: Yeah, it's related to that, additional field you want to add to… Get transaction by hash.

182
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:50.910
FLCL: Yeah, I'm just, I just think that we need to be stricter and have less options.

183
00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:57.709
FLCL: In what can be… Like, field radio. I mean.

184
00:19:58.090 --> 00:20:03.779
Chase Wright: Yeah, that's a good point. If you want to leave a message, leave a comment on the…

185
00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:11.040
Chase Wright: on that issue, that would… that would be fine. That is a good point, though. Like…

186
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:15.229
Chase Wright: It's… we should pick one, because that does make…

187
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:24.680
Chase Wright: testing a little bit harder. If one client returns a null and the other client just leaves it out, then that makes it more challenging. So, that's a good point.

188
00:20:29.210 --> 00:20:38.549
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, thank you. I would also, want us to, in case we have any other comments on this, we can leave, some comments on the issue, then we can move forward from there.

189
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:46.689
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And also, Sims, I… I don't know if you have any updates in regards to the error code standardization you want to share with us today.

190
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:57.460
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, hi. Not much, haven't gotten any response, even after posting it in the, All Core Devs channel.

191
00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:02.210
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But I started working on the, hype test,

192
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.650
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, don't have a ton of progress, but…

193
00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:11.759
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I think we should still get the original PR merged, because it doesn't have any impact on validations, or…

194
00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.020
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: generations, etc.

195
00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:21.169
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: If everyone agrees, at least we should get them merged, and then I can start working on the test, separately.

196
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:33.350
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Yeah, about merging it, we kind of, like, have a little blocker, because, there was a merge, in the repo, so they're trying to fix the lint issue.

197
00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:35.599
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Then, after that, we can stop…

198
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:43.190
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: comfortably start making PRs, but I think we can tag, Felix Cheers.

199
00:21:43.310 --> 00:21:47.690
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Ace, and then… I don't know who else has measuring rights.

200
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:52.030
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: But…

201
00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:52.450
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Sounds good.

202
00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:52.900
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh…

203
00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.310
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Once the linting issue is, fixed?

204
00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:03.549
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Sorry, someone else have to fix it, or… because I don't see it in my…

205
00:22:03.670 --> 00:22:05.830
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Beer that it's complaining.

206
00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:12.029
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Have you put… have you by any chance pulled the latest changes to your local?

207
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:18.139
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I… I did. I even pulled the latest one today.

208
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.869
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: And, fix some conflicts.

209
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:29.069
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: For me… oh, it says all the workflows are awaiting approval, so I think maybe after someone approves…

210
00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:31.370
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: I might complain?

211
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:36.610
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, because, I'm not sure,

212
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:43.560
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I don't know if it's going to complain or not, but we kind of, like, have APR on.

213
00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:46.609
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: To fix length issues due to the merge we had.

214
00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:52.210
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, like, if that is done, then we can now move over to this. And also.

215
00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:59.830
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: For us to continue with, other core devs, we need to write tests and show them, then we can now start poking them about it.

216
00:23:00.440 --> 00:23:07.430
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Oh, no, of course, I agree. I don't suppose anyone will start implementing it until we have the tests on.

217
00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.599
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But yeah, this has been open for a while.

218
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:24.660
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: The problem with the test is also the RPC test gen currently generates the test input and output based on GET, but GET hasn't implemented these error codes, so…

219
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:32.129
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: We may have to write the generation logic slightly differently for this. I cannot reuse the existing ones, because, again, it uses GET.

220
00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:35.570
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: So I'm looking into it currently,

221
00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:42.840
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But I don't suppose it's going to be straightforward, or reuse the existing test gen as it is.

222
00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:46.050
Chase Wright: Yeah, you're…

223
00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:46.850
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Just to be clear.

224
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:56.039
Chase Wright: right there, because, I was having some of those issues with RPC Test Gen and, GATH not having the right

225
00:23:56.550 --> 00:24:01.009
Chase Wright: thing. So in RPC TestGen, you can write

226
00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:06.939
Chase Wright: In… in the test generator, you can write checks to make sure that

227
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:14.340
Chase Wright: That Go Ethereum is right, but the problem doing that is then it's just gonna fail, and the test generator is gonna say, like.

228
00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:26.250
Chase Wright: you know, hey, this test… I can't generate tests for this test because your checks are failing, and then we have to go to the Geth team and be like, you know, hey, fix the library, basically, right?

229
00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:27.620
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Exactly.

230
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.370
Chase Wright: It's a pain.

231
00:24:28.590 --> 00:24:29.090
Chase Wright: Yeah.

232
00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:37.120
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, yeah, that's exactly what I'm facing, too. So, maybe we… before I start implementing the test, maybe we should talk to Kath team and,

233
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:47.759
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: get an opinion, if they want us to write custom tests in our PC testgen, and then they'll implement, or they implement, and we use that to generate the custom test.

234
00:24:47.850 --> 00:24:54.829
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: It's not a blocker, but it's good to get their opinion before I do a ton of work.

235
00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:11.939
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But I'm still exploring some POC, to see how that will plan out. But yeah, regardless, I still do think if most of them agree, because it has been silent for a while, haven't gotten any negative reviews or anything that we want to fix at this point too much.

236
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:21.280
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: And if it doesn't impact anything, I think we should merge it, and then slowly proceed to getting it implemented one by one.

237
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.380
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

238
00:25:25.690 --> 00:25:36.549
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So, I don't know if… do you mind, sharing a little bit about this, so that I can, like, CC, Sina, or anyone from the GetSim?

239
00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:48.919
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Sure, yeah, I can… I can repost this in, the, all core devs, and, ask for some reviews, and also explain this issue.

240
00:25:49.290 --> 00:26:03.230
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Maybe by next meeting, we can pull in someone from GetTeam. I think… is that Felix from GetTeam? I remember talking to someone at the last, meeting, and he said he could help me out.

241
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:06.580
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: But yeah, I can, I can put this in the group chat. Okay, okay.

242
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:08.829
Simsonraj Easvarasakthi: Yeah, I'll reach out to him too. Thank you.

243
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:17.490
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I think that's all from the agenda. I don't know if someone or if anyone has anything else.

244
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:29.630
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Chase?

245
00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.739
Chase Wright: I got nothing else.

246
00:26:35.670 --> 00:26:36.909
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay.

247
00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.250
FLCL: About the questioning…

248
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:47.140
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'm not sure if… We have, or we're planning on anything in regards to how to fashion,

249
00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.220
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the specs.

250
00:26:53.300 --> 00:27:06.640
Chase Wright: So I think once, once Patch's stuff is merged in, then the generator and everything will be in one repo. It'll be a little bit easier for us to…

251
00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:15.920
Chase Wright: to create a versioned release. I think we need to just go through all the current pRs…

252
00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:18.450
Chase Wright: And maybe, maybe some of the issues…

253
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.740
Chase Wright: And see what we want to knock out before… for them?

254
00:27:25.130 --> 00:27:30.169
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so how do we, like, collectively do that, like…

255
00:27:30.910 --> 00:27:38.859
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: do I make a list and then post on the chat, then we can now, like, say, okay, we want this in the first version, we want this… this can come in later, this…

256
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:42.719
Chase Wright: Yeah, I think that would… that would be fine. We can probably do it in Discord.

257
00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.610
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, okay.

258
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:49.169
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'll probably make a list and then create a trend.

259
00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:56.200
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: It's just that the… on the chat, we hardly, have, we… I think there's a communication gap. I'm not sure if I'm…

260
00:27:56.660 --> 00:28:03.430
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I'm wrong, but, like… How do we get everybody to have an input? Because the more…

261
00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:07.960
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: The more people we have to reach a consensus, the better and the faster we

262
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:10.520
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: We can actually, like, get,

263
00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:14.829
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Goals you can actually achieve on things around this.

264
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:29.970
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: But, okay, I'll try and make the… I'll kind of, like, list,

265
00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.099
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, Zane, can you add on…

266
00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:48.269
Zane Starr: Oh, I was just talking about the parameters thing. I was just dropping a note saying that the line breaks should be somewhat of an easy fix.

267
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:57.110
Zane Starr: But the interactive widget may be a little bit more complicated, so it's just something we'll have to look at. That's all I was adding that update.

268
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: He's gone.

269
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.190
Zane Starr: Huh?

270
00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:09.820
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: My phone raised their hand, so I'm trying to let the person have the floor.

271
00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:20.920
Tullio | Erigon: Oh, yeah, it's me. Hi, everyone. About the diversioning thing that we are discussing, I think…

272
00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:30.899
Tullio | Erigon: there are… two different, topics. One is… The one that Chase introduced.

273
00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:42.640
Tullio | Erigon: Which is… Having a version for Execution API, which… clearly…

274
00:29:42.670 --> 00:30:01.809
Tullio | Erigon: states, which generator is used to generate which tests, so, okay, having them in the same repo is obviously very good, and we can have, then, a proper versioning for the execution APIs.

275
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:14.590
Tullio | Erigon: repo, but then another topic which I think we should discuss sooner or later, is versioning of

276
00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:20.900
Tullio | Erigon: API endpoints, towards… the application layer.

277
00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:30.670
Tullio | Erigon: So towards the customer who are using the JSON RPC endpoints for doing their stuff,

278
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:38.079
Tullio | Erigon: Just to be clear, something like… the engine API already has.

279
00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:49.099
Tullio | Erigon: so, introducing some… Version number, maybe, in the… within the… the endpoint name, or…

280
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:57.649
Tullio | Erigon: Or, okay, we can come up with many different ways, but I think we will need also to do

281
00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:07.220
Tullio | Erigon: To… to… Introduce a proper versioning scheme also towards the endpoint users.

282
00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.120
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I have a question, because…

283
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.810
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And the whole idea is, okay, but, like, how do we actually, like, cater for application,

284
00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:27.100
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: users, the endpoint users, because we don't have them here. How do we get them to…

285
00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:30.910
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: At least make, an opinion of this.

286
00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.749
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Because getting an opinion from them will be much more better.

287
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:38.000
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah.

288
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.650
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: And on the best ways to go about this.

289
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:46.749
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah. I agree on that.

290
00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:59.020
Tullio | Erigon: yeah, I don't know, maybe on… some ACD call is a…

291
00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.700
Tullio | Erigon: A good place where to ask for this, because…

292
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.389
Tullio | Erigon: Maybe some of them are joining such calls?

293
00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:10.090
Tullio | Erigon: I don't know.

294
00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:15.899
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I think I just recalled…

295
00:32:16.330 --> 00:32:19.950
Tullio | Erigon: Maybe Chase has some experience on that to share?

296
00:32:21.250 --> 00:32:26.750
Chase Wright: I mean, not really, like… Just getting at… getting the…

297
00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.650
Chase Wright: The, like, app developers involved in a lot of this stuff has…

298
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:37.960
Chase Wright: always been fairly challenging. They don't… They don't typically,

299
00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:45.829
Chase Wright: They don't typically participate, they just… right around Most of the issues.

300
00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:48.690
Chase Wright: Yeah, I don't know.

301
00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:55.890
Tullio | Erigon: Yeah, yeah, I can understand. But, okay, we could do another thing in… Which is…

302
00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.350
Tullio | Erigon: I think that if we devise a…

303
00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:09.460
Tullio | Erigon: A reasonable way to introduce versioning, which doesn't completely break the…

304
00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:12.660
Tullio | Erigon: The existing stuff, but it's…

305
00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:17.400
Tullio | Erigon: If there is a migration plan or something like that.

306
00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:24.319
Tullio | Erigon: And we do it in a backward-compatible way, then… It can be opt-in.

307
00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:36.990
Chase Wright: I mean, I don't think us adding versioning is gonna break anything backwards compatible, because everything that exists today just pulls from main, because releases don't exist, so…

308
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.770
Chase Wright: Would be alright.

309
00:33:37.770 --> 00:33:39.310
Tullio | Erigon: Yes, yes, it could talk.

310
00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:46.460
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, I just had, a sort of, thought.

311
00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:48.729
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Sorry, go on.

312
00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.559
Zane Starr: Sorry, just before we move on from versioning, I think,

313
00:33:54.730 --> 00:34:02.139
Zane Starr: There's a PR out for, adding back the built assets of the…

314
00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:10.130
Zane Starr: Spec. So, at some update in between, versions, I think…

315
00:34:10.610 --> 00:34:20.040
Zane Starr: there is a repo that will have the built OpenRPC JSON. I know, like, FlashBots and maybe a few others were relying on that.

316
00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.340
Zane Starr: So, it might be something that you also want to do.

317
00:34:24.830 --> 00:34:26.489
Zane Starr: When the versioning happens.

318
00:34:49.350 --> 00:34:52.489
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I can think of to get, endpoint users.

319
00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:54.030
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Literally.

320
00:34:54.900 --> 00:35:01.060
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: I can do that and then get back to us on this, and we'll move on from there, if that is okay.

321
00:35:07.260 --> 00:35:10.110
Chase Wright: Yeah, I don't think we're gonna solve it on this call, so…

322
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:19.399
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Okay, so I will reach out to them, and then… I'll reach out to Sam, then see what he says about it.

323
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.929
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: So I think that's all from my end, or what we have on the agenda. I don't know if…

324
00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:32.940
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Anything else you want to talk about, or discussions? I think someone from Nethermine team brought out, an issue, but…

325
00:35:33.180 --> 00:35:37.529
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: the issue sort of died out, and I can't even remember what it was exactly.

326
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.460
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: those.

327
00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.189
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Ending of last year.

328
00:35:50.570 --> 00:35:51.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Oh, okay.

329
00:35:53.770 --> 00:36:01.440
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: All right then, thank you all for joining today's call, and it was really a pleasure having you guys here. Thank you very much.

330
00:36:02.330 --> 00:36:02.950
Chase Wright: Hey, you…

331
00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.310
Tullio | Erigon: Thank you.

332
00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:05.840
Mercy Boma Naps-Nkari: Bye.

333
00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:07.480
Zane Starr: Thanks.

334
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.540
Zane Starr: Right.
