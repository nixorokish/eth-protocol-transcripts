00:16:00	FLCL:	Most users continue to use centralized endpoints? But what's alternative, full node? Portal in the current form?
00:17:14	Dirk Jäckel:	For mobile users there is currently no alternative.
00:19:34	Dirk Jäckel:	It doesn't sound good for me :-(
00:29:40	Meld:	Is there specs written with this new focus ? 
Which is the expected roadmap ? 
Who will take care of Hive Test if this are still used?

00:37:00	Meld:	We are interested in continue working!
00:38:32	Marius:	Replying to "We are interested in..." 

 Great, which team are you on? (Trying to take notes)
00:38:50	Meld:	Replying to "We are interested in..."

Samba
00:39:17	Marius:	Reacted to Samba with "👍"
00:43:32	Simon | Besu:	Some members of Besu team are keen to see the integration happen, and we previously agreed to, but we want to reevaluate the change of plans before committing now.

We don’t have much portal knowledge within the team.
Progress via a besu plugin has been made by Samba team (meldsun, Derek).
We would likely be happy to support if they are in a position to continue working on it.

00:47:53	Simon | Besu:	What are the options for syncing a near-head EL node post-rolling window 4444s?

Can we use a recent era entry as a trusted checkpoint to begin syncing from?

Or would portal history network unlock some better syncing options?
00:49:36	Marius:	How do you feel about finding a different name for the slimmed down portal history network. I keep getting confused which flavor someone is talking about
00:49:49	lightclient:	Well 4444 will never expire data <5 months due to weak subjectivity
00:49:54	lightclient:	Simon ^
00:54:03	Simon | Besu:	Replying to "Well 4444 will never..."

I guess geth plans to sync all headers backwards the same way as now? But then only request the most recent 5 months of blocks over devp2p?
 
Or do you plan to use portal for sync somehow?
00:54:31	Rafael:	How to choose the nodeID, random based on key (I suppose XOR metrics will be maintained)? I guess it is relevant in order to store content the node is interested in.
00:56:56	Meld:	What about the json-rpc endpoints, will they be deprecated ?
01:03:23	grapebaba:	@Felix feel free to DM me in discord
01:05:50	Felix:	yes I will!
01:08:42	Paul Jickling:	portal-dev in the eth r&d discord
01:09:12	Kim:	Ok, makes sense
01:09:39	FLCL:	ty
01:09:40	Meld:	Thanks!
01:09:47	grapebaba:	thanks
01:09:49	Derek Sorken:	Thank you!
01:09:49	thinkAfCod:	Thanks
01:09:50	Simon | Besu:	thanks
