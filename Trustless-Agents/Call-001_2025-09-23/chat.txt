Praxis dev here. Well, it’s a very nice question. At first we’re working on guardrails on this and some ZKP based private data obfuscation. At second, all sensitive data interaction will be based on VC&VP mechanics, which is guaranteed to have a high-granulated access control to the user data

01:06:02	Tim Cotten:	Hi everyone! Tim from Scrypted here to talk about reputational threat mitigation for agents!

https://eip-8004-dispute-proposal-tcotten-scrypted.replit.app

We built a simulator for 8004 agents for examining & mitigating sybil attacks when malicious competitors leave bad ratings. My hope is that it spurs discussion about adding one additional primitive to the spec: a Dispute object in the Reputation registry.

Why? This would allow an agent to immediately respond to bad feedback with either a proof of refund, or an open dispute they wish to resolve. We let market dynamics do the rest: staking, arbitration services, agency ratings calculations. I just believe this additional primitive gives a balancing power back to the agents themselves versus external attestations.

They are not acting as validator nodes, they are working on pricing the work of agents. We are working on doing causal audits to build better incentive mechanisms. With that they create score vector which is used to distribute the rewards, etc

Would love to! My goal is to just have Dispute added to the spec, and let market products do the rest. Scrypted cares about the success of our own agents, we’re not productifying the simulator, just wanted to use it to justify the suggestion for the spec 🙂

Ziemann, I think we’ve got it pretty handled for deterministic work with the current proof systems. When we move to non-deterministic I’ve got an entire protocol on that called Commit-Reveal Pairwise Comparison (wrote this during a16z CSX pre-seed) - when you have to do fuzzy comparisons or subjective ones. I think we leave it agnostic but I’m happy to plug in our layer to help
