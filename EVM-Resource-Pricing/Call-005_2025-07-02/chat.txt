00:06:19	Davide Crapis:	Giving 2 mins for ppl to trickle in
00:06:56	Sophia Gold:	gm
00:07:10	Davide Crapis:	Hi!
00:07:30	Davide Crapis:	Marcin you okay to go first? I‚Äôll intro
00:07:38	Marcin Sobczak:	yes
00:14:28	Sophia Gold:	we've heard from zkVM teams that ecrecover is one of the most underpriced for proving
00:15:37	Danno Ferrin:	Is this just looking at precompiles?
00:16:51	Luis Pinto | Besu:	We are already using native libs for EcAdd but I think the benchmarks we have ATM are not great as they do not replicate well Marius‚Äô case so hard to try out other native libs. Would like to revisit our benchmarks first
00:17:20	Maria Silva:	I believe they looked at all opcodes + precompiles
00:17:50	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Keccak is fully Java so warmup is welcome
00:18:20	Ansgar Dietrichs:	one general comment: in Glamsterdam we'll try to homogenize pricing across all compute operations.

so after that the mindset will likely have to flip from ‚Äúoptimize the next bottleneck so we can scale further‚Äù to ‚Äúfind the next operation we can optimize to make it cheaper‚Äù
00:18:45	Davide Crapis:	Reacted to "one general comment:..." with üëç
00:19:18	Ansgar Dietrichs:	Replying to "one general comment:..."

best candidates will likely be the operations where there are large performance differences across clients
00:21:48	Sophia Gold:	TBD whether we can benchmark for zk in time for Glamsterdam (I'd like to, but not totally necessary) but for these ones it's surely worse than reexecution with higher gas limits so I suggest at least pricing them on the higher side
00:22:47	Ben Berger:	Why is x gas limit translated to x/3 gas per second?  Block times are 12 seconds, not 3
00:23:13	Davide Crapis:	Safe Execution budget is 3s
00:23:49	terence:	Replying to "Safe Execution budge..."

because attestation deadline is set at 4s into the slot?
00:27:06	Ivo Kubjas:	Have you measured how much would the modexp repricing affect existing transactions gas usage wise?
00:27:38	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Safe Execution budge..."

^ yup
00:27:54	Ben Berger:	Reacted to "^ yup" with üôè
00:28:17	Parithosh Jayanthi:	Replying to "Why is x gas limit t..."

Due to attestation deadline being at 4s, adding 1s of margin

00:31:13	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Besu is not using that one

00:33:45	kev:	Reacted to "https://docs.google...." with üëç
00:34:55	kev:	Replying to "https://docs.google...."

Forgot that we switched to gnark, but reverted it because of a serialization inconsistency (that‚Äôs now been fixed)

00:38:42	lukasz.glen:	on the x axis is the numer of pairs
00:40:02	Luis Pinto | Besu:	How is the expected gas cost  computed?
00:40:29	Davide Crapis:	Replying to "How is the expected ..."

Using the formula
00:40:36	Davide Crapis:	Replying to "How is the expected ..."

He showed before
00:40:47	Luis Pinto | Besu:	Replying to "How is the expected ..."

Ok missed it
00:42:32	kev:	Is it safe even at 100M?
00:44:03	Jacek Glen:	Reacted to "https://docs.google...." with üëç

00:47:08	lukasz.glen:	regarding EIP-7904, after some discussions on Magicians, DIV gas cost should be a bit higher, because it is executed in two modes, one is trivial and quick, and only the expensive mode is eligible.
00:49:57	Jacek Glen:	Reacted to "regarding EIP-7904, ..." with üëç
00:51:38	lukasz.glen:	there were some tests regarding backward compatibility
00:59:37	Maria Silva:	Which team?
00:59:52	Sophia Gold:	stateless team
00:59:59	Maria Silva:	Reacted to "stateless team" with üëç
01:04:22	Ansgar Dietrichs:	also worth mentioning that state benchmarking is also relevant for the code size increase EIPs (7907)
01:07:04	kev:	On zkEVM, I don‚Äôt think we should try to get zkEVM repricing based on the performance of current zkEVMs in Glamsterdam, especially given that their performance is decreasing at a quite fast pace
01:07:11	kev:	(Forgot to click send)
