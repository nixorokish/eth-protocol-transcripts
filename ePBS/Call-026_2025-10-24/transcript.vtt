00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.219
Justin Traglia: Hey, Pooja, how's it going?

2
00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.020
Pooja Ranjan: Morning, Justin, it's good. How about you?

3
00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.490
Justin Traglia: Doing well. Happy it's Friday.

4
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:27.130
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, thank you. So, I'll just go ahead and get started the pre-stream in next 3 minutes, and whenever you are ready, let me know to move over the stream.

5
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.900
Justin Traglia: Okay, I'll do. I'm gonna go ahead and share my screen, just in preparation.

6
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.179
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, sure, no problem.

7
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.310
Justin Traglia: Good morning, Barnabas.

8
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.329
Barnabas: Hello, Halloween.

9
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.819
Justin Traglia: Hello, hello. Just a couple more minutes, and then we'll get started.

10
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:17.379
Justin Traglia: Good morning, everyone. Just a couple more minutes, and then we'll get started.

11
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.359
ethDreamer (Mark): Gotta refresh the page, because I just left something there.

12
00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.030
Justin Traglia: Yeah, we can talk about this.

13
00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.770
Justin Traglia: I'll, just assume it's appended to the end of the agenda.

14
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.329
Justin Traglia: Alrighty, Poocha, can you… can we go live?

15
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:18.969
Pooja Ranjan: We are live.

16
00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:26.859
Justin Traglia: All right, thank you. Hello, everyone. Welcome to ePBS Breakout Call 26.

17
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:39.389
Justin Traglia: To jump right in, I'd like to state that there is a new consensus specifications release, Beta.1, which I believe we have decided to use, for DevNet0.

18
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.350
Justin Traglia: Epbs DevNet Zero, that is.

19
00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:53.399
Justin Traglia: Yep. There are some open PRs, and there were quite a few close PRs this week. I'm not gonna go into each and every one of these, but feel free to review if you want.

20
00:08:54.530 --> 00:09:03.519
Justin Traglia: There… yeah, just some open testing PRs, and then I've personally started reviewing the specs and just fixing up, random things that I see.

21
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:09.609
Justin Traglia: And there are starred, though, there still are two open, like, to-do.

22
00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:14.259
Justin Traglia: Things that need to be fixed if anyone wants to make a PR.

23
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:24.099
Justin Traglia: Okay, I guess we can just jump right into, updates from client teams. Is there anyone from prison that can give us an update?

24
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:51.489
terence: Let's see… we haven't really merged anything to develop, unfortunately, because we're, like, blocked by Fusaka release, and we wanted to wait for the new spec, because of the data column side card. We added a slot, and then we changed the field location for the slot, so we wanted to wait until that before with formal reviewing, and

25
00:09:51.700 --> 00:10:05.999
terence: And the merging that to develop. So we were able to finally start reviewing that yesterday. So, hopefully, once that's merged, we'll see more PRs getting much developed, but we have about, like.

26
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:25.780
terence: 8 open PRs right now that's actually implementing the beacon Chin.MD and passing SPED tests, so hopefully it's just a matter of reviewing and merging that, then we can start working on, say, four choice in parallel, P2P in parallel, validated on the spec in parallel, and getting ready for Definite Zero.

27
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.369
terence: But yeah, but I would say majority of the process right now, progress is blocked by merging into development.

28
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:36.920
Justin Traglia: Got it. That makes sense. But that's great.

29
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.269
Justin Traglia: Promise that they're both traveling this weekend, I see.

30
00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:47.899
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you. Is there anyone from Lighthouse here? Maybe Mark? They can give an update?

31
00:10:49.790 --> 00:11:02.449
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I mean, progress is ongoing. We're in… working on block processing right now, and some people are joining the effort, so hopefully that should accelerate.

32
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:04.580
ethDreamer (Mark): But yeah, still a ways off.

33
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.390
Justin Traglia: Got it.

34
00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:11.989
Justin Traglia: And, any other updates, Shane? I think you're also part of Lighthouse, right?

35
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:32.769
Shane Moore: Hey, yeah, just echoing what Mark said, and we are starting to at least, get some PRs into, like, a conga line of, PRs, so it's supposed to, you know, going straight into, like, a develop branch, kind of, taking it as, like, first starting with the types, for containers, and then we'll have for it.

36
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:35.730
Shane Moore: We are in the Congo line.

37
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:37.730
Shane Moore: load processing.

38
00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:44.180
Shane Moore: in the end, when we're ready, we'll merge all that into a developed branch. So, a little bit more,

39
00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.970
Shane Moore: sequential, I guess.

40
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:55.129
Justin Traglia: Got it. Thank you. Alright, who from tech who would like to get an update?

41
00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:07.439
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah, I can give an update. We've been merging… merging a couple of things to master, in Teku, making some progress.

42
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:09.410
Stefan Bratanov: Yeah.

43
00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:18.090
Stefan Bratanov: pretty much that's it. A few things here and there, but majority… I think I haven't started on fork choice or any database changes, so…

44
00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:22.539
Stefan Bratanov: I can't speak much about when we would be ready for deadlines.

45
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.490
Justin Traglia: Yeah, no worries.

46
00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:28.010
Justin Traglia: I don't see anyone from Nimbus here.

47
00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:29.080
Justin Traglia: Correct.

48
00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:35.440
Justin Traglia: Okay, could someone from Lodestar, or Caleb?

49
00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:36.690
Caleb: Hi.

50
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:48.470
Caleb: So I'm Caleb. I'm working on this stuff on Nimbus. I'm joining the team soon, officially. So I've been merging a couple of stops to the unstable branch,

51
00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:58.669
Caleb: I think we just have the networking aspect to complete. We're about 70% there. We are yet to touch for choice at all.

52
00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.680
Caleb: But soon, I guess. So that's it from us.

53
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.220
Justin Traglia: Okay.

54
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.289
Justin Traglia: Thank you, and you're welcome.

55
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:09.330
Caleb: Thank you.

56
00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.779
Justin Traglia: Okay, I guess load start next. Who wants to have an update?

57
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:23.509
NC: Hey, so LOSAR, we have, implemented everything in the… well, at least the first half of the state transition.

58
00:13:23.630 --> 00:13:28.680
NC: So everything from EPUB processing, block processing, except for the,

59
00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.700
NC: Processing the execution payload envelope.

60
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:37.949
NC: And we are passing, about two-thirds of the operations spec us.

61
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.459
NC: So we need to continue to debug, like, what's wrong.

62
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:45.179
NC: And afterwards, we'll touch the other stuff, such as fork choice.

63
00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:47.590
Justin Traglia: Okay.

64
00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:52.029
Justin Traglia: Thank you. And last but not least, Grand Dean.

65
00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:57.889
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Yeah, so we are also progressing on UPBS implementation.

66
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:09.010
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: But I think we likely are, like, a few weeks from implementing it. So yeah, there is good progress, but we still need to do a lot.

67
00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:13.390
Justin Traglia: Okay.

68
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.290
Justin Traglia: Thank you, everyone.

69
00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.289
Justin Traglia: I guess we can jump into the next agenda item.

70
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:24.450
Justin Traglia: Mehdi, would you like to talk about your proposed changes to attestation data?

71
00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:27.789
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, sure.

72
00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:37.670
Mehdi Aouadi: So yeah, basically, I wanted to, to, to address the issue with the, attestation data index field.

73
00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:49.719
Mehdi Aouadi: Where basically we have… we have a field named index, that doesn't hold an index at all, and so in Elekta, we chose to hard, code it to zero.

74
00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:56.049
Mehdi Aouadi: To avoid the complexity. And now we are using it to signal the payload status.

75
00:14:56.290 --> 00:15:01.750
Mehdi Aouadi: Which is, to me, very confusing, from a spec perspective.

76
00:15:02.270 --> 00:15:06.769
Mehdi Aouadi: And, even from an implementation perspective, it could be really

77
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:12.800
Mehdi Aouadi: Hard to handle, since, we could end up, like, doing a lot of,

78
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:25.519
Mehdi Aouadi: of checks, to check, which fork we're in, to know how to, to consume that field, basically. So, yeah, my proposal is to rename it to Payload Statues.

79
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:33.990
Mehdi Aouadi: And for simplicity, I kept the same type, which is UN64, to avoid any SSE serialization

80
00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:41.750
Mehdi Aouadi: added complexity. So, yeah, basically that's, that's my proposal.

81
00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.639
Justin Traglia: Thank you. I don't know if it's…

82
00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:56.519
Justin Traglia: I mean, have we ever renamed a field before in the consensus specs? I don't know how difficult that is for teams.

83
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.790
Justin Traglia: If it's difficult at all.

84
00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:11.050
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, I mean, renaming the field would be the same thing as… it basically, I guess, it means introducing a new container, because it's, like, like, removing a field or adding a new one.

85
00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:23.229
Mehdi Aouadi: So, and that was one of the, arguments against this change, because it could, imply adding new… a new GlowOS container for the attestation data.

86
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.069
Justin Traglia: But to be honest, I mean.

87
00:16:26.300 --> 00:16:31.740
Mehdi Aouadi: There is added complexity, anyway, if we keep it like that.

88
00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:51.479
Mehdi Aouadi: like, checking the fork each time to know how to consume the index field, would definitely add complexity and confusion in the code. And adding a new container also would add some boilerplate code, but I guess that

89
00:16:53.110 --> 00:17:05.540
Mehdi Aouadi: it's worth the effort, in my opinion, because it makes the spec really clear and less confusing, and I'd personally prefer that approach, since either way, we would have some added complexity, so…

90
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.730
Mehdi Aouadi: Yeah, that's my take on it.

91
00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:10.700
Justin Traglia: Got it.

92
00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:12.979
Justin Traglia: How do others feel about this?

93
00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:20.440
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, I think… I'm com- coming from the…

94
00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:24.509
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Difficulties, let's call it like that.

95
00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:35.849
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): After Electra, that we had a lot of long-tail bugs associated to… Index field, specifically.

96
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:48.729
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Due to the fact that from the code perspective, everything referring to that was perfectly fine, but then the interpretation of it, changed it.

97
00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:53.089
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And, nothing was breaking.

98
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:59.760
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): But it was, actually, and I think it was the source of several

99
00:18:00.020 --> 00:18:03.319
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): bugs, I don't think only in Tegu.

100
00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:04.959
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): To a f…

101
00:18:05.630 --> 00:18:18.010
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Facing those changes early by changing the underlining data structure forces us to deal with these things.

102
00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:23.580
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Earlier, and once things work, we have the guarantees that everything is fine.

103
00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:28.740
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Plus, we have a better… spec, reading.

104
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.680
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, I think worth, worth,

105
00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.030
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Discussing this and evaluating clearly this.

106
00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:57.060
Justin Traglia: How do others… How do other devs from other teams feel?

107
00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.510
Justin Traglia: Otis, how do you feel?

108
00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:09.739
potuz: Yeah, I'm very strongly against this, but I mean, it's not a hill that I'm willing to die for.

109
00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:14.990
potuz: So if other teams want to make this change, I'm happy, but

110
00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:23.770
potuz: For us, it's really a nightmare to include… to change these containers. I definitely recognize that the spec becomes much nicer.

111
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.520
potuz: Or at least less ugly.

112
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:29.090
potuz: And this is already, like, spec depth.

113
00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.149
potuz: from Electra that we probably should have changed it.

114
00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:36.390
potuz: Because then we actually did

115
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.770
potuz: Have to change a lot of the attestation paths.

116
00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:47.980
potuz: So probably then it would have been a little extra, Complexity and implementation.

117
00:19:48.270 --> 00:20:03.940
potuz: And it was worth it. But this time, I don't see how… how can it possibly be worth it? I don't know how Teco manages this, and how is this issue of, like, checking the fork or not, but the way we process attestations is we get an attestation.

118
00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:08.040
potuz: And to be able to deserialize it.

119
00:20:08.550 --> 00:20:13.070
potuz: We need to know, essentially, in which kind of fork we are.

120
00:20:13.410 --> 00:20:22.559
potuz: Because, well, we have a different container, with a list of or not for elect or not, but after we deserialize it.

121
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:31.690
potuz: we… we just run a simple check. I mean, this attestation is of this type, or this attestation is of that type, and we send it to the corresponding processing,

122
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.160
potuz: processing function.

123
00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:46.710
potuz: the only thing that would change now with the current status is just add one extra line. If the attestation data slot is after the… after the glow as fork.

124
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:54.460
potuz: to send it to process at the station in Gloas, which is an entirely new function. And if it's before, then you just send it to the previous function that you had.

125
00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:07.669
potuz: So it's just a single line, and I don't care… I mean, within that function, which is the gloss function, you're gonna treat the index one way, and without this function, you're gonna treat it, and the index check that it's 0 if it's pre-electra, if it's Electra.

126
00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:21.839
potuz: So I don't see how that extra complexity is going to be saved. We anyways need to implement this new helper function that is the process attestation in Gloas, and you anyways need to do this branching, depending on the fork that you are.

127
00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:40.080
potuz: So the extra complexity that would come from changing the attestation data type is a lot of boilerplate. Well, for us, at least, it's just an incredibly large amount of boilerplate. We're gonna need to add interfaces for the attestation data, which… that we currently don't have, because we're gonna have, like, different types that will need to

128
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:44.310
potuz: To implement that interface of the attestation data type.

129
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:58.590
potuz: Did I get kicked out.

130
00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:01.479
Justin Traglia: It looks like he got dropped for a second.

131
00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:08.259
potuz: I don't know where I stopped, but anyway, so… at least from my point of view, I don't see how

132
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:24.330
potuz: adding this, it's not increasing difficulty, and strictly increasing difficulty, without removing any of the difficulty. And I don't see how it can prevent bugs of the form of, like, how do you deal with the index, because you do the branching before this.

133
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:33.719
potuz: You do the branching on to which function you are… you're processing the attestation before, you need to check what the value of the index is.

134
00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:40.510
potuz: But again, I mean, even though I'm strongly opposed to this, because I do feel like for us it's going to be a lot of complexity.

135
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:49.290
potuz: If other teams, besides just Deco, want to have this, I'm happy. I'm happy not to die on this hill.

136
00:22:50.010 --> 00:23:09.589
ethDreamer (Mark): I… like, Lighthouse could do this as well internally in our codebase, and have a, like… I mean, we have a process for changing data structures from one fork to another, because we've done it many times, and as we saw with Electra, that changing the attestation

137
00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:20.679
ethDreamer (Mark): just the attestation, not even the attestation data, was already a lot. If we changed the attestation data, we would have to do more.

138
00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:30.020
ethDreamer (Mark): And then we would need to… I mean, we could leverage the fact that we've already changed the attestation. It wouldn't be quite as difficult the second time, but…

139
00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.730
ethDreamer (Mark): Still, like…

140
00:23:33.150 --> 00:23:39.359
ethDreamer (Mark): I mean, we didn't change this in Electra because it was a bunch of extra work, and we could change… and…

141
00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:43.030
ethDreamer (Mark): we're adding a bunch of extra work now. Yes, it's…

142
00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:48.159
ethDreamer (Mark): Like, the fact that it's named index is inelegant, but you're adding…

143
00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:56.090
ethDreamer (Mark): I don't know, I don't think the juice is worth the squeeze. Like… Is it cleaner? Yes.

144
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.580
ethDreamer (Mark): But, yeah, it's just…

145
00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:06.560
ethDreamer (Mark): like, if we didn't do it in Electra, I don't see a reason to do it now. Yeah, kind of echoing what Poda said.

146
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.540
ethDreamer (Mark): We have so many things to do, man.

147
00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:12.350
ethDreamer (Mark): And this is a small inelegance.

148
00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.320
ethDreamer (Mark): Which…

149
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:20.750
ethDreamer (Mark): If we ever need to change the… like, if there ever comes a time where we need to change the attestation data.

150
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:23.700
ethDreamer (Mark): that is when I would propose we fix it.

151
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:29.900
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

152
00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.239
Justin Traglia: Yes, Aliens?

153
00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:44.280
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Yeah, so for Grandina, it also would be hard to implement such change, and maybe a little…

154
00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:53.559
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: a bit less than the new attestation type we had in Elektra, but we would be against

155
00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:59.979
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: This change, just because of the huge complexity in the codebase.

156
00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:01.709
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: So, I mean…

157
00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:10.670
Saulius Grigaitis | Grandine: Likely, at least our opinion is that it's… it's too little value compared to the… so much hassle in the codebase.

158
00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:19.180
Justin Traglia: Okay. Thank you all.

159
00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:25.879
Justin Traglia: I think I liked Mark's idea of, like, if and when we need to change attestation data in the future, we…

160
00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:28.890
Justin Traglia: Push fixing this until then.

161
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:33.759
Justin Traglia: So that would mean not including this in Coas right now.

162
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:35.260
Justin Traglia: Huh.

163
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:37.120
Justin Traglia: Does that sound fine to everyone?

164
00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:44.110
Justin Traglia: Alrighty.

165
00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:49.230
Justin Traglia: Maddie, thank you for the PR, but please close it whenever you have time.

166
00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:56.919
Justin Traglia: Next agenda item, I guess, would be Mark's topic.

167
00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.710
Justin Traglia: Mark, do you want to bring this up again?

168
00:26:00.790 --> 00:26:04.089
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I mean, I was just looking at the gossip…

169
00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:09.320
ethDreamer (Mark): conditions for payloads, and notice we didn't have one

170
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:12.749
ethDreamer (Mark): About… oh, this is for beacon blocks,

171
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:20.440
ethDreamer (Mark): And I put the relevant pieces for beacon blocks in there. I should have linked also the gossip conditions for payloads, but,

172
00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:25.439
ethDreamer (Mark): Let me see if I can find that real quick, because I have it opened in one of these tabs here.

173
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.360
ethDreamer (Mark): Give me one… Certain…

174
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:37.780
ethDreamer (Mark): Okay. It's not… I have too many tabs open, but we just don't have a,

175
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.359
ethDreamer (Mark): We don't have, like.

176
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:48.089
ethDreamer (Mark): a condition like this for payloads, and I'm wondering if we need one. Maybe we don't, but…

177
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:56.140
ethDreamer (Mark): you know, we could have one, and I was wondering if it was intentionally excluded. Here we go, here's the gossip conditions for payloads.

178
00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:03.600
ethDreamer (Mark): And I'm wondering if we intentionally excluded this or not. Like, we…

179
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:09.450
ethDreamer (Mark): We just have that the envelopes block route has been seen.

180
00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:19.260
ethDreamer (Mark): Right, we don't have that… this is, like, a timely payload, or… I mean, we do have that the slots are equal, but there's just… there's nothing regarding…

181
00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:27.810
potuz: But doesn't it preclude the condition? The first condition is about, like, a block being from the future, right? A block from the future slot.

182
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.340
ethDreamer (Mark): Yes.

183
00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:33.310
potuz: And you couldn't have seen a blog From a future slot.

184
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.710
potuz: Therefore, if you only import your payload after you've seen a block, then you.

185
00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:39.440
ethDreamer (Mark): Nothing.

186
00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:43.869
potuz: you're not importing a payload from the future. So I think this is implied already.

187
00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:51.059
ethDreamer (Mark): I suppose, yeah. And what was the second condition? Oh, maximum clock disparity, yeah. So…

188
00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:53.159
ethDreamer (Mark): And the second condition was…

189
00:27:54.020 --> 00:28:02.410
ethDreamer (Mark): greater than finalized slot, so that would… I guess, do we have a condition that says we can't receive a payload, like an older payload?

190
00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:07.509
ethDreamer (Mark): That we have… we have something blocking the future payloads, do we have an older payload that we're…

191
00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:09.720
ethDreamer (Mark): Not going to be accepting.

192
00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:25.179
potuz: Oh, so the second condition is about a block being older than the latest finalized one. We just don't take it over GoSip, right?

193
00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:25.980
ethDreamer (Mark): Right.

194
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:39.120
potuz: Yeah, so I think… I think this is… this is a good one. We should… we should add a line saying that, if the block route is later than the latest finalized, then we don't gossip the payload for that block route.

195
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.450
ethDreamer (Mark): Okay.

196
00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:41.470
potuz: That's a good catch.

197
00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.270
Justin Traglia: Yep, agreed.

198
00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:47.530
Justin Traglia: What do you open a PR for this, Mark?

199
00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:48.540
ethDreamer (Mark): Sure.

200
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:50.340
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you.

201
00:28:53.730 --> 00:29:00.359
Justin Traglia: I think that's it for the agenda today. Is there anything anyone would like to talk about before we end the call?

202
00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:11.359
Shane Moore: Yeah, I'm just curious for, like, DevConnect, if there's any ideas for, like, interop, EPBS stuff, maybe things we haven't really sorted out, like…

203
00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.289
Shane Moore: dual PTC deadlines and things like that.

204
00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:23.089
Justin Traglia: I'm unaware of anything, but we should definitely get a group together.

205
00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.679
Justin Traglia: To, like, discuss all this kind of stuff.

206
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:28.090
potuz: Yeah.

207
00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:29.140
Shane Moore: Yeah. Service available.

208
00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:46.330
potuz: ideas on the deadlines, on the dual deadlines. It'd be nice to get ideas on the numbers, but I think this whole business of the pre-option problem put influence there. So I think it's going to take us time to be in a place where we're actually benchmarking what's the right numbers for those.

209
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:53.240
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I have another questionnaire for this, too, actually.

210
00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:59.580
Justin Traglia: Okay.

211
00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:00.050
ethDreamer (Mark): atmosphere.

212
00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:06.420
Justin Traglia: Pretty much we're done with this, but I'll work… I'll talk with, like, POTUS and Shane and try to get something organized.

213
00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:11.499
ethDreamer (Mark): My… okay, so my question is, if we are doing this second validation that it's greater than the…

214
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.730
ethDreamer (Mark): finalized slot. Well…

215
00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:24.639
ethDreamer (Mark): I don't know, that's an interesting… because we have a payload timeliness committee, and payloads have to be timely. I guess blocks do, too.

216
00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:39.329
ethDreamer (Mark): I don't know. I have to wonder why this is a… this is only restricting blocks on gossip to being greater than the finalized checkpoint, and not anything more recent than that, given that blocks themselves should be timely.

217
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:49.759
ethDreamer (Mark): And is that condition the same? Like, is that modified at all between blocks and payloads because we have a payload timeliness committee? Like, can we make a tighter assumption about how

218
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.149
ethDreamer (Mark): Far back the boundary is with payloads, is my question.

219
00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:57.240
potuz: why… I don't understand, I mean, this,

220
00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:04.760
potuz: the timeliness of the payload or not has nothing to do with the propagation of the payload, right? So we want to be propagating payloads

221
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.419
potuz: Because that's a branching port choice that we want to see.

222
00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.710
potuz: I mean, the timeliness or not of it, I think it's independent. This is something about, like, boosting

223
00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:17.119
potuz: Or, or allowing for payments, but,

224
00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:22.729
potuz: But I think we do want to be able to propagate branches that we hadn't seen.

225
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:25.279
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, okay.

226
00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.610
potuz: older than finalized has to do with the fact that we are not anywhere.

227
00:31:28.610 --> 00:31:29.959
ethDreamer (Mark): It's going to advance on that one.

228
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:32.740
potuz: branch that is contending with our finalization.

229
00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.000
ethDreamer (Mark): Okay, yep.

230
00:31:34.710 --> 00:31:37.240
ethDreamer (Mark): Yeah, I was just thinking through that, because…

231
00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:41.110
ethDreamer (Mark): I, yeah. Okay, that makes sense.

232
00:31:48.730 --> 00:31:50.740
Justin Traglia: Anything else from anyone?

233
00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:06.190
Justin Traglia: Alrighty, thank you everyone for joining. Talk to you all again in two weeks.

234
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.490
potuz: Thank you, guys.

235
00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.660
Justin Traglia: Bye, bro.
