00:08:35	terence:	6am : (
00:08:40	Mehdi Aouadi:	Reacted to "6am : (" with 🙈
00:09:57	potuz:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4728
00:10:00	potuz:	last minute one
00:12:39	terence:	i think we want to update the test to assert the line committeed randao vs payload randao
00:12:43	potuz:	caleb?
00:12:51	potuz:	ah Caleb logged in and left
00:16:20	Francesco:	Also might just be nice for ex-post transparency of the auction
00:16:51	Justin Traglia:	Yeah that’s my issue with it too
00:17:37	Francesco:	Other option could also be to just add a single bit, that says whether or not the value should be protocol enforced or not
00:17:58	Francesco:	value  (same as now)
 enforce_payment: bool
00:19:03	Francesco:	Replying to " value  (same as now..."

(And of course if  enforce_payment  is not set the state transition just ignores the value)
00:21:17	terence:	i wonder if execution api (not engine api)already support this today, for example  if you know the index of tx? or check the balance of an account pre or post block.. minus if you have withdrawal amount
00:31:26	Francesco:	Personally I wouldn’t care too much one way or another because anyway the balance changes between epochs are bounded and quite small
00:31:55	Francesco:	Using new balances could be thought of as a very slight security reduction
00:39:14	Francesco:	Assuming someone has deeply thought about it being where it is now in the first place 😆
00:39:44	Justin Traglia:	Reacted to "Assuming someone has..." with 😅
00:41:29	terence:	+1 in the bid
00:42:12	terence:	can we add a test to this plz
00:45:20	terence:	no preference for me
00:46:27	Francesco:	el_payment
00:46:30	potuz:	bid.trustme_bro_value
00:46:43	potuz:	el_payment is good
