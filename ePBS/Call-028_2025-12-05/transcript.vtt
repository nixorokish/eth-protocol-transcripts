00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.010
Justin Traglia: Good morning. Thank you.

2
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.379
Pooja Ranjan: Good morning.

3
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:29.169
Pooja Ranjan: We are updating the calendar as well. I don't know, for some reason, the bot is broken, and every meeting has this passcode issue. We are just fixing it.

4
00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.010
Pooja Ranjan: Just give me a few more minutes to get ready with streaming.

5
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.280
Justin Traglia: Okay. Yep, no rush.

6
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.620
Justin Traglia: I will also take a moment to prepare.

7
00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.430
Justin Traglia: Good morning. Oh, sorry. Good morning, everyone. Just a few more minutes.

8
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.529
Pooja Ranjan: Alright, I am ready to go whenever you are.

9
00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.650
Justin Traglia: Okay, let's do it.

10
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.470
Pooja Ranjan: We are live.

11
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.560
Justin Traglia: Hello, everyone. Welcome to EPBS Breakout Call 28.

12
00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:03.169
Justin Traglia: There's a lot to go over today, so I'll probably jump right in. I'd like to quickly state that since the previous breakout room call, there has been a new consensus specs release.

13
00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.320
Justin Traglia: Version 1.6.1.

14
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.610
Justin Traglia: We can and will publish a new release soon, if plants want it.

15
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.870
Justin Traglia: I've shared the list of PRs.

16
00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.129
Justin Traglia: Since the last breakout call.

17
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.110
Justin Traglia: The ones that have been merged have been checked.

18
00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:25.300
Justin Traglia: So, for the unmerged ones, please take a moment to review them.

19
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.550
Justin Traglia: If you haven't already.

20
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.040
Justin Traglia: And, one final note,

21
00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.799
Justin Traglia: The… sorry, the final breakout call will be on December 19th, 2025.

22
00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.020
Justin Traglia: After that, all of the,

23
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.400
Justin Traglia: The last discussions will move to ACDT.

24
00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.959
Justin Traglia: Which will be dedicated to Glamsterdam.

25
00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:59.189
Justin Traglia: Let's start with… or sorry, let's… let's do, updates from client teams. Is there anyone here from Prism that can give us an update on their implementation?

26
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.740
terence: We haven't made much progress last week because of Fusaka. Yeah.

27
00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.700
Justin Traglia: That makes sense.

28
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.110
Justin Traglia: Lighthouse?

29
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.580
Justin Traglia: Okay, no one here from my house. Taku, please?

30
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:33.910
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, not as much progress, as well. We are… we are currently working on…

31
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.610
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Gossip validation rules, mostly.

32
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.600
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, not yet fully ready.

33
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.070
Justin Traglia: Okay.

34
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.010
Justin Traglia: Nimbus.

35
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.480
Justin Traglia: Oh, hey Dustin. I just asked for an update on… from Nimbus on, glass implementations.

36
00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.489
Dustin: And was one provided? I obviously don't have context.

37
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:06.540
Justin Traglia: Nope.

38
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.999
Justin Traglia: Asked right as he joined.

39
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.440
Dustin: Right, okay.

40
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:27.590
Dustin: So, this is something that both of, I guess, Caleb, my understanding, has been showing up here? I don't know, he tells me. And yeah, we've merged, more EPBS support into

41
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.710
Dustin: Into truck?

42
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:36.130
Dustin: In an ongoing way. I don't know if there's a specific, set of specs or aspect of EPBS that you're…

43
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.979
Dustin: Asking about in this context?

44
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.239
Dustin: But yeah, we're continuing.

45
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.049
Justin Traglia: Okay. That's good enough.

46
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.730
Justin Traglia: Lodestar? How is your work going?

47
00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:03.159
nflaig: So yesterday, we merged a pretty big PR for the state transition, and we passed all the spec tests from 161. And there's work in progress for P2P and block building.

48
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.669
Justin Traglia: Nice. And last but not least, Grandine.

49
00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.780
Subhasish: Yeah, I can take this one.

50
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:22.800
Subhasish: So, from last meet, we have the… we have, closed the PRs on, Sync Manager, and,

51
00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:42.740
Subhasish: Sync Manager changes for envelopes, plus, request response, changes for envelopes, and, the support for payload, timeless committee assignment, and, its integration into Blog Producer. We have some, open PRs on,

52
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.589
Subhasish: On the gossips of handling for,

53
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:56.240
Subhasish: envelopes and bits. I think for, attestation, it was, recently merged. There's an open PR for, local blog building.

54
00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:14.719
Subhasish: And on the fork choice, side, we have, initial implementation that's, passing, the initial, gloss tests, which are added, and, yeah, we're, looking into that, that aspect mostly.

55
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.900
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

56
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:23.410
Justin Traglia: Okay.

57
00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.199
Dustin: Alright, sorry, can I…

58
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.620
Justin Traglia: Fuck.

59
00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:39.099
Dustin: So, I'm… I'm told, I don't know, is Caleb on this call yet? Like, is he, is he… I hadn't see if he… Yeah, he is, hi. Okay, so…

60
00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.410
Caleb: He'll be fairly…

61
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.710
Dustin: So, so I would like to actually hand this over to him, who has a lot more context on this than I do. Alright.

62
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:47.760
Dustin: Thanks

63
00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.079
Dustin: As far as the EPPS and Nimbus?

64
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.300
Justin Traglia: Yep.

65
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:04.440
Justin Traglia: Caleb, do you have any updates other than what Dustin said?

66
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.330
Caleb: None, none.

67
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.380
Justin Traglia: No worries.

68
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.160
Justin Traglia: Let's move on to the agenda items, I suppose. Thanks for the updates from clients.

69
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:23.319
Justin Traglia: I don't know what your first name is, but JCS Legal?

70
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:28.699
Justin Traglia: Could you, talk about the dynamic penalty proposal that you brought up?

71
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.849
christophschlegel: Right, yeah, I'm Christoph. J is for Jan.

72
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:41.010
christophschlegel: But you can call me Christopher. Okay, I can have some slides.

73
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.199
christophschlegel: Which I'm not able to share.

74
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.799
christophschlegel: You can also do it without slides,

75
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.480
christophschlegel: Or if somebody gives me the rights to…

76
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:55.710
Potuz: Booja?

77
00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:56.100
christophschlegel: Too shit.

78
00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:59.809
Potuz: You might have the rights to make you a co-host, or something like that?

79
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:04.050
Justin Traglia: I could also stop sharing, I don't know if that's the reason.

80
00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:07.800
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, maybe you have to start stop sharing, and then try again.

81
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:09.790
Justin Traglia: Alright, please try again.

82
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.210
christophschlegel: Oh, that's Wix.

83
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:12.670
Justin Traglia: Sorry.

84
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:13.919
christophschlegel: No worries.

85
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:22.130
christophschlegel: Okay, does this work?

86
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.960
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yep.

87
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.910
christophschlegel: Okay, so this is how Nana Banana…

88
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.189
christophschlegel: Imagines EPPS to look like, and this is a free option problem on the right-hand side.

89
00:08:34.309 --> 00:08:41.379
christophschlegel: That's what I wanted to talk about. So, Bruno and I have been, investigating this free auction problem.

90
00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:44.739
christophschlegel: To remind you, so that the problem is that…

91
00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:52.219
christophschlegel: you have commitment to a payload, but you don't reveal it when you make your bid.

92
00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:59.929
christophschlegel: And then you have time to reel payload and blobs, and there's a time window between

93
00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:11.179
christophschlegel: Commitment and revelation, and people might change their mind in between whether the block that they want to publish is actually a reasonable block, and the way to exploit it is to…

94
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:21.710
christophschlegel: Put usually a bunch of trades in your blog, and if they go against you, the market goes against you, you basically don't publish.

95
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:32.289
christophschlegel: publish a block. And the gadget that you would use for that would be, you fail to… usually you fail to deliver a block, so that's a free option problem.

96
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:38.140
christophschlegel: We were looking into different mitigations, and,

97
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:48.350
christophschlegel: Have looked in particular into penalties and reward schemes, so we penalize, if you miss a payload or a blob.

98
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.910
christophschlegel: And… or we… we reward you for doing that, if you deliver it.

99
00:09:53.370 --> 00:10:04.870
christophschlegel: And, we've gone through a bunch of things, and the most promising to us is dynamic penalties, where we, put the… where we use,

100
00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:17.820
christophschlegel: basically the… we introduce correlation, in… so we punish correlated failures, more severely than isolated failures. So the idea is if you…

101
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:27.429
christophschlegel: fail from time to time to deliver a payload. That's basically a very small penalty, but if we observe a lot of those,

102
00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.779
christophschlegel: Fair payloads, then we increase penalties, to…

103
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:40.520
christophschlegel: basically punish people for which something that looks like a free option exploitation.

104
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:48.169
christophschlegel: And the rationale behind that is that, first of all, it's a robust metric, a robust statistic to base

105
00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:59.220
christophschlegel: penalties on, and the other idea behind it is that you usually observe this clustering, volatility clustering. So you observe that exercising,

106
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:04.250
christophschlegel: The pre-option, is… lucrative…

107
00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:13.309
christophschlegel: in time intervals where you, basically have a correlation of, where you have clustering of opportunities. So you want to punish there.

108
00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.340
christophschlegel: Right, so…

109
00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:27.000
christophschlegel: That is irrational. You could also do it with, rewards, so you reward people, but the problem is if you do dynamic rewards, people can basically,

110
00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:36.259
christophschlegel: Can, can game them by basically increasing rewards for themselves, so penalties are less gameable.

111
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:45.930
christophschlegel: So proposals that we have, and we have an implementation that we put on EASH Research, or a SPAC, a spec on EASH Research, is that we,

112
00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:50.390
christophschlegel: Have a concrete rule of setting the size of those penalties.

113
00:11:50.730 --> 00:12:05.290
christophschlegel: Which, is dynamically adjusted, so you would need to introduce another state variable, to the protocol that keeps track of the penalty, and that takes in this information how many failed,

114
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.680
christophschlegel: payload failures, as I have been, recently.

115
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:17.060
christophschlegel: And then we use those, penalties, we keep track of them, and we use… we propose to use the payments

116
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:36.779
christophschlegel: that are pending payments that are already part of the spec, to also keep track of penalties. So, effectively, what we propose is that you, you would add, another, field to this pending, pending, builder payments, container that would also keep track of penalties.

117
00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:40.750
christophschlegel: So let me tell you briefly what is this rule.

118
00:12:41.140 --> 00:12:44.359
christophschlegel: So, the idea is very simple, so you,

119
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:51.719
christophschlegel: have a penalty, which is this another, new state variable that we introduced, missed payload penalty.

120
00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.820
christophschlegel: We would propose to introduce.

121
00:12:53.960 --> 00:13:09.249
christophschlegel: We go up with a penalty if the block on top of which you build has no payload, and we go down with a penalty if it has one.

122
00:13:09.420 --> 00:13:11.599
christophschlegel: So that's the dynamic aspect of it.

123
00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:23.600
christophschlegel: We have written also some theoretical paper on this, which gives you a bunch of guarantees. So the object of interest for the theoretical guarantees is a failure rate, so you have a

124
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:35.369
christophschlegel: failure rate that you target, so you say, I don't know, 1% failed payloads is acceptable, or 0.5% is an acceptable failure rate.

125
00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:55.559
christophschlegel: And then you, look, and then you can design those, or you can set those, parameters in such a way that you achieve those, rates on average. So those are theoretical guarantees that you can get, in terms of, yeah, in terms of…

126
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:58.879
christophschlegel: Online learning, kind of, standard results.

127
00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:07.139
christophschlegel: And so, the other interesting parameter is how long of a time window you want to sustain this failure rates over. That gives you, basically.

128
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:15.630
christophschlegel: how aggressively you move it up and down, okay? So those are the two, two…

129
00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.939
christophschlegel: Parameters that we introduced.

130
00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:24.790
christophschlegel: Going up was a penalty, going down was a penalty. Then we did a bunch of backtesting,

131
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:37.750
christophschlegel: of this policy, so we've looked at realized… we have a data set of realized blocks, so of course, I mean, if forward-looking, people might build different kind of blocks if they have a…

132
00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:47.489
christophschlegel: Free option, available, but at historical blocks, we looked into how that, changes, the effect, how effective it is to…

133
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:58.009
christophschlegel: To exercise this free option, and how much does it mitigate, and basically theoretical guarantees that you have from this online learning results are…

134
00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:08.729
christophschlegel: replicated, quite well in the data. So you can set a target acceptable rate of failures, so failures would be, things where the option would be

135
00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:15.289
christophschlegel: Mmm… Profitable to exercise, even with a penalty.

136
00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:27.789
christophschlegel: For example, you set it to 0.5%, and then you observed that actually in our dataset, this very closely matches, the realized profitable exercise rates.

137
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.040
christophschlegel: Are very much close to that theoretical.

138
00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.420
christophschlegel: Guarantees that you want to achieve.

139
00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:42.789
christophschlegel: You can also see, so those numbers are in east, the, sort of size of those,

140
00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.269
christophschlegel: Those penalties that he would need to…

141
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:51.839
christophschlegel: levy in order to, to, to, to achieve these, rates, so it would be…

142
00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:10.909
christophschlegel: ballpark 0.02 to 0.04 ETH, to achieve this, half a percent of acceptable failure rate, in the worst case, and, well, they escalate in… in times of high volatility, so they can go up to… to 1 ETH in,

143
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:17.430
christophschlegel: In very volatile times. But on average, they stay sort of low, so that's… that's the point.

144
00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.070
christophschlegel: So that's, the idea behind it.

145
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:27.070
christophschlegel: There are also graphs where you see, sort of, the fluctuation of Profitability, over time.

146
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:33.540
christophschlegel: With different, different parameterizations, and then you see, how, how large,

147
00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:41.619
christophschlegel: penalties would be, if you would set them accordingly. And you see that, I mean, in these where volatility spikes, you would have

148
00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:45.710
christophschlegel: Also, spike of, the… Penalties.

149
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:53.730
christophschlegel: Okay, I think that's… Big picture… the… the…

150
00:16:53.910 --> 00:17:08.150
christophschlegel: the idea behind it. Yeah, you can set them in many different ways. We've given, as I said, an example spec where we set it, these, these, parameters,

151
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:10.050
christophschlegel: According to…

152
00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:20.269
christophschlegel: These values here, so as you say, it goes more aggressively up as it goes down, because you, yes, you need to escalate very rapidly if you want to.

153
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:36.789
christophschlegel: to the policy to be effective, but this targets, basically, for example, a failure rate of half percent. And then it's a question of what do you find acceptable, right? So what do you find acceptable in average penalties, and what you find acceptable in

154
00:17:37.310 --> 00:17:41.979
christophschlegel: Missed, missed, payloads rates.

155
00:17:42.350 --> 00:17:48.089
christophschlegel: So, yeah, one can debate about it. What we can say is you can…

156
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:55.820
christophschlegel: Achieve, because there's also a sort of theoretical worst-case guarantees, you can achieve very robust, guarantees on these.

157
00:17:56.030 --> 00:18:08.670
christophschlegel: I probably shouldn't go too much… I rather wanted to hear opinion on, or elicit feedback on the general idea, but we have a spec, so you have this new, new, new parameter where you…

158
00:18:09.180 --> 00:18:11.800
christophschlegel: Sets the penalties, and then you have to…

159
00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:25.420
christophschlegel: account for the penalties, and so what we propose to do there is we track them together with pending payments, right? So we have this object of a pending payment in ERP7732,

160
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:44.120
christophschlegel: You, have, payment… pending payment, so a pending payment, is in the queue if it's, is basically for an unconditional payment where a payload was not, delivered, so you can use it as a gadget to also keep track

161
00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:48.110
christophschlegel: Of penalties at the same time, so you keep track of them together.

162
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:56.680
christophschlegel: And then you would, basically, deduct those penalties at the end of the subsequent epoch.

163
00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.849
christophschlegel: From the, the builder, balances.

164
00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:19.549
christophschlegel: And then you also have to make sure that the builders are able to pay those balances and the pending payments, so what you would also need to add is basically a condition on the bids that says, if you bid, we have to make sure that you are able to pay those penalties as well as all pending payments and all pending penalties.

165
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.440
christophschlegel: What I think is important as Twilight is that you should also,

166
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.269
christophschlegel: Put penalties on self-builders, and so you basically also need to keep track of those,

167
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:40.869
christophschlegel: So, self-building penalties, so… but you can use the same kind of gadget in principle. Why is it important? Because otherwise people would circumvent, maybe, penalties by…

168
00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:42.360
christophschlegel: Yeah.

169
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:50.860
christophschlegel: going, through, I don't know, a relay or something like this, to, to, to, exercise the free option without…

170
00:19:51.590 --> 00:20:00.660
christophschlegel: getting a penalty. So that's the idea. We've looked in possible issues that we thought about, probably other ones.

171
00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:14.089
christophschlegel: So, it could be a problem that you penalize not only people who want to exercise a free option, but also honest builders that have a bad day. So they don't do it on purpose.

172
00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.499
christophschlegel: What we think is, sort of.

173
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.729
christophschlegel: It might be a problem, but what would you think is… is,

174
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:42.849
christophschlegel: still argue… we would argue for the penalties. For example, self-builders, they can always release a payload together with a commitment, so at the point in time where they commit, they can also release a payload into blobs. So, I mean, they have to be highly unlucky to miss,

175
00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:50.100
christophschlegel: miss, basically, the deadline for the payload timeliness Committee, if they do that.

176
00:20:50.290 --> 00:20:54.930
christophschlegel: So, the risk is very limited. External builders, there's risk for them.

177
00:20:55.150 --> 00:20:58.090
christophschlegel: Right? But then we…

178
00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:10.250
christophschlegel: as we have shown in the graph, so on average, those penalties are low. So even if somebody is unlucky and gets a penalty, then, well, it's not…

179
00:21:10.410 --> 00:21:14.309
christophschlegel: the end of the world. It's a small amount, on average.

180
00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:26.299
christophschlegel: And if they're unlucky to miss a… get a penalty in times of high volatility and high penalties, of course, that could be substantial, up to one ease, or above that. I don't know, what is the most extreme scenario?

181
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:40.809
christophschlegel: might have a bearing on how people behave, then, in these times of high penalties. So, one thing that we imagine could be that they are more conservative in what they're doing. For example, they

182
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:52.499
christophschlegel: Omit maybe sending blobs, if that is… introduces more errors in… to the, more failures in expectation for margin of safety.

183
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.850
christophschlegel: That might be downsides. It could be that, if there is…

184
00:21:57.250 --> 00:22:11.739
christophschlegel: Right? We do penalties that are based very much on the idea that correlated failures are much more… punished much more than isolated failures, so if there's a bug in a builder software, or, like, in the default builder.

185
00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.070
christophschlegel: In a client, that could cause correlated penalties without us actually, you know.

186
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:37.570
christophschlegel: wanting to do them, so it has nothing to do with malicious behavior, but it's sort of… that could be an problem. And in principle, people could maliciously try to, you know, make you not sending your payload, because they want you to be punished. A malicious actor could do that.

187
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:42.649
christophschlegel: But of course, that is true in general. I mean, also in… if you…

188
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:52.020
christophschlegel: missed, to send… if you missed to send a payload in time, then you also forego profits. I think this problem is already there to some degree.

189
00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:55.310
christophschlegel: So, that's the high-level idea, and…

190
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:01.259
christophschlegel: What else are rewards? If you don't like that penalties are there.

191
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:05.089
christophschlegel: And then you can make that on expectation. Basically, you can…

192
00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:12.849
christophschlegel: make it zero by introducing rewards, right? So we cannot do dynamic rewards, so in extreme cases, we have to punish.

193
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.949
christophschlegel: But on average, we can make you break even if you wanted to do that. That comes

194
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.970
christophschlegel: at the cost of additional issuance, potentially. Or we have to reduce…

195
00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:37.829
christophschlegel: you know, rewards for other, duties. But in principle, that's one way of achieving, basically, a zero on average, for, on, for… because you combine rewards, with penalties.

196
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:39.320
christophschlegel: Okay.

197
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:48.819
christophschlegel: We have written, it's research post, we would be very happy about feedback on it. We've tried to come up with a spec, probably

198
00:23:48.920 --> 00:24:04.810
christophschlegel: you will… I mean, it would be highly appreciated if people could look into the spec, see whether there are any… any problems in the spec, and give us feedback on, whether that is something that we could introduce to

199
00:24:05.490 --> 00:24:13.690
christophschlegel: help us with the free option problem. Final thing that I wanted to say is, so, there will be, I guess, some discussion later on about these,

200
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:22.000
christophschlegel: About the builder payments in protocol, so I think, with or without these trustless payments.

201
00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:33.680
christophschlegel: it's reasonable to mitigate the free option problem. The solution should work in either case. SPAC would be slightly simpler if we would have,

202
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:37.050
christophschlegel: No in-protocol payments, but that's the only difference.

203
00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.430
Justin Traglia: Thank you so much for the presentation, that was really good.

204
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.759
Justin Traglia: Does anyone here have feedback and or questions?

205
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.080
Potuz: I have a question, how…

206
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:56.680
Potuz: I mean, the proposal to remove Trustless payments.

207
00:24:57.190 --> 00:25:06.579
Potuz: also removes staked builders. I mean, the easiest way of doing this would be to remove also staked builders. How do you implement this penalty mechanism in that case?

208
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:15.599
christophschlegel: Well, then you have just, normal proposers, proposing, and then you keep track

209
00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:25.590
christophschlegel: of, whether they… Deliver the payload, and you… can process them as…

210
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.899
christophschlegel: penalties together with other penalties. With the penalty to the… so you mean…

211
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:39.850
Potuz: The proposal is to… but the proposal would be to have the payload signed by an off-protocol builder that is not state.

212
00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:49.969
Potuz: So, you could keep track of these payloads not being delivered, but the only state object that you can actually penalize is the proposer, not the builder.

213
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.769
Potuz: So it doesn't seem to me…

214
00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:54.219
christophschlegel: Also, of course, you would penalize a proposal, yes.

215
00:25:54.570 --> 00:26:01.190
Potuz: Yeah, so you only penalize the prop… so you would penalize the proposer for payloads that are not delivered by builders.

216
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:09.950
christophschlegel: I mean… he can always build his own payloads, I mean, if he outsources it to shady actors, then…

217
00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.239
christophschlegel: his problem. But, yeah.

218
00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.909
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We're moving the risk from the builder to the proposer, essentially.

219
00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:25.750
christophschlegel: Right, and then out of protocol, people have to find ways of, you know, doing this risk sharing among themselves.

220
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:30.029
christophschlegel: I guess if I propose blocks,

221
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:43.789
christophschlegel: if I'm a proposer and I elicit blocks through an external service, then I would want that service to make sure that payloads are delivered, and otherwise there's some

222
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:51.519
christophschlegel: I don't know, some stake, right, outside of protocol, right, on the relay level, or so on. Otherwise, it would self-build.

223
00:26:54.690 --> 00:26:57.750
Justin Traglia: Alex, I saw that your hand was up. Do you want to say anything?

224
00:26:57.750 --> 00:27:06.380
alex: No, I think Christopher covered it well, and I hesitate to, like, draw in the next discussion already. I think Christoph covered it well.

225
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:09.779
Justin Traglia: Okay, anything else from anyone before moving on?

226
00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:17.499
Potuz: Yeah, I had a comment. The proposal is actually sound. I've checked the spec, it seems complete.

227
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:31.050
Potuz: It is complicated, and it's… it's an issue of whether or not it's enough of a problem that we want or not implement this, but that's a different discussion. The only, like, new philosophical change that I see

228
00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.670
Potuz: Is that today.

229
00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:48.460
Potuz: the spec doesn't have this… this issue of a common bug in a client. The spec is designed in such a way that if you have downtime… downtime, which is the kind of things that common bugs cause, like what Prism cost yesterday.

230
00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:51.780
Potuz: Validators are not heavily penalized.

231
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:59.460
Potuz: And that's… you can't really be someone lucky to be heavily penalized. Being very unlucky on a bug is… you hit a bug that just…

232
00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:11.529
Potuz: doesn't prevent your slash in DB, for example, and then you get slashed. That would be a bad bug. But the common bugs of, like, liveness that we have on clients don't cause capital loss to… to…

233
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.270
Potuz: to validators.

234
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:19.719
Potuz: this thing might actually cause it, because if you do have a bargain on the EL,

235
00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:31.330
Potuz: that causes some blocks to be missed, then builders will not start, will not start providing bids. And if you have… if you are in a situation where you don't provide bids, then you self-build.

236
00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:46.969
Potuz: And if you self-build it with that client, then suddenly you're heavily penalized in that situation. So I think this is new. I think this is the first time that we see a liveness bug creating, a liveness bug in a minority, not in a majority client creating these things.

237
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:49.340
Potuz: I'm not sure how to weight that.

238
00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:56.750
christophschlegel: It's true. I guess. Yes.

239
00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.709
christophschlegel: Only thing that I can say.

240
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.040
christophschlegel: Don't introduce bugs.

241
00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:03.430
christophschlegel: and your clients.

242
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:08.989
Justin Traglia: Okay, let's move on to the next topic. We don't have all that much time.

243
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:16.230
Justin Traglia: Barath would like to speak about the Builder API with ePBS. Barath, would you like to share your screen?

244
00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:18.670
Bharath: Yeah, I'll just share my screen.

245
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.019
Bharath: Let me know if you guys can see.

246
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:25.010
Bharath: Yep. Can… can see it.

247
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:26.650
Bharath: It's visible, right?

248
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:27.640
Justin Traglia: Yep.

249
00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:40.329
Bharath: Oh, yeah, sounds good. Yeah, so hey guys, thank you for letting me speak. The, the agenda for this talk, like, my intent is to kickstart, like, discussions on how the Builder API could look with EPBS.

250
00:29:40.440 --> 00:30:00.109
Bharath: again, everything, like, assumes we have, like, trustless payments and all that. So, just, like, I'm just gonna, like, run over, like, some background, like, which I don't have to do in this call, but PBS has, like, stake builders and trustless payments. The main thing is we restructure the beacon block by removing the full execution payload out of it, and only embedding, like, the bid to it.

251
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:13.570
Bharath: Right, so these are, like, the major data structures. You have the execution payload bid, the execution payload bid, which just contains a commitment to the full, like, payload. And you have the actual envelope, which has the

252
00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:17.470
Bharath: Actual, like, payload and the commitments to the blobs and execution requests.

253
00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:31.060
Bharath: So, and then, you know, we see that in the beacon block body, like, at this point, like, we remove, like, the blob commitments, execution requests, and the entire payload, and we just replace it with a bit.

254
00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:32.450
Bharath: So…

255
00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:52.079
Bharath: So, having that, just, like, establishing some ground, right, so how do builders communicate their bids with proposers, right? Like, and that's what the builder API, like, essentially does today, is, like, it's basically an interface between the proposer and builder to, like, exchange, like, block bids and commit to a block.

256
00:30:52.100 --> 00:31:06.270
Bharath: So today, EPBS has… one of the things, we have a P2P gossip topic, which allows, like, stakeholders to, like, propagate their execution payload bits. It'd also be nice if proposals were able to directly connect to the builders, and to gain, like, a much lower latency connection.

257
00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:24.050
Bharath: So, so the… so I'm, like… so the work that I'm trying to do is, like, try to think about how the builder API could look like when the proposal talks to, like, stake builders from the proposal… and also when the proposer talks to, like, unstake builders, or off-protocol builders. At this point, like, I want to stop, like, I think that is…

258
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:32.369
Bharath: I know there is, like, contention, Portis, I've been discussing with you, you… you know, you mentioned that, you know, we… we don't want, like, we won't support, like.

259
00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:47.100
Bharath: talking to builders out of the protocol, but then I've also heard, like, people saying opt-protocol builders will still exist. I understand, like, there's some contention there. I'll leave that to, like, the end of this discussion, to end of this… end of my topic. I have that as an open question.

260
00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.069
Bharath: Now I just want to, like, quickly discuss on…

261
00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:59.100
Bharath: on the high-level, like, flow of the Builder API, how it could look like with EPBS. Again, this is, like, early work, and I'm sure there's a lot of, like, refinement we can do.

262
00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:06.670
Bharath: With stake builders, the builder API will kind of look very similar to how we have it today. So these are builders in protocol, they're staked.

263
00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:26.169
Bharath: With them, the builder API will probably look, like, pretty similar, like, if you… the flow would be, like, the proposal queries the builder, like, hey, I want a bid, give me your best bid. The builder sends back the best bid, and if the proposal, like, likes it, the proposal will commit that bid in its beacon block.

264
00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:42.319
Bharath: once it commits the bid in the beacon block, it returns it back to the builder. So these are two, like, API calls. We can talk about names later. But, like, you get the execution payload bid, then you build the beacon block, and you send it to the builder.

265
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:48.470
Bharath: Right? And both the proposer and the builder can, like, broadcast the beacon block to the beacon committees.

266
00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:54.789
Bharath: The builder at this point, now that we have the beacon block, you can actually construct the execution payload envelope.

267
00:32:55.010 --> 00:33:01.619
Bharath: And once the builder has the execution payload envelope, the builder is, like, responsible, solely responsible for,

268
00:33:02.290 --> 00:33:04.930
Bharath: broadcasting the envelope to the PTC committee.

269
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:12.999
Bharath: So, it's pretty simple, it doesn't involve… it's kind of similar to the get header and get payload, interface we have, like, today.

270
00:33:13.290 --> 00:33:16.860
Bharath: So this is, like, how I think it would look like with stake builders.

271
00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:21.050
Bharath: Things get a little trickier with off-protocol builders, so…

272
00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:27.410
Bharath: Technically, like, in this case, proposals will have to act as of the self-build, because the protocol has no idea about the builders.

273
00:33:27.570 --> 00:33:32.060
Bharath: The proposers, like, and the proposer have to… has to sign the payload envelope.

274
00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:40.380
Bharath: Right? The bid, it doesn't have to sign the bid, because I forgot, like, it's because the spec doesn't enforce that the proposer signs the bid.

275
00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:55.499
Bharath: But it has to sign the envelope, which is usually with the relay, which is, like, since it has the entire payload, right? But to sign the envelope, they require, like, a full payload, the execution request, and the commitments from the relay to sign it.

276
00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:07.889
Bharath: So, we can introduce… so, I'm just introducing this notion of a blinded execution payload envelope. I'll get to the flow of how the builder APEC would look like, and maybe that… it makes sense.

277
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:19.360
Bharath: So I'll just introduce a blinded execution payload envelope. This is basically the execution payload envelope, but then we just have the roots of the payload execution request and the blob KCG commitments. Everything else, like, is the same.

278
00:34:19.730 --> 00:34:20.750
Bharath: So…

279
00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:39.179
Bharath: The interface, the flow would look like this. The proposer asks for the execution payload bid. It receives the execution payload bid back from the relay. The relay also sends the payload route and execution request route, because that data is not included in the execution payload bid.

280
00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:45.710
Bharath: The proposer constructs a blinded execution payload envelope with the payload route and execution request root.

281
00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:55.179
Bharath: If it likes the bid, it also embeds it in its beacon block, sends the beacon block and the blinded execution payload envelope to the relay.

282
00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.939
Bharath: Both the relay and the proposal broadcast the beacon block.

283
00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:13.460
Bharath: And then, and then once the beacon block is broadcasted, the relay can construct the full execution payload envelope from the blinded execution payload envelope, because it's essentially the same, it's just the hash tree roots of the data.

284
00:35:13.850 --> 00:35:24.180
Bharath: And then once the relay has that, it's able to, like, broadcast the execution payload envelope, the signed one, to the PTC committee. Again, these are, like, off-protocol builders who are not staked in protocol.

285
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:41.900
Bharath: Right? You just, like, by sending the payload route and execution request route here, which, in my, in my opinion, like, just helps, helps in, like, not having, like, a third API call, where now the beacon block has been sent. Since you can only construct the envelope with the beacon block.

286
00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:50.450
Bharath: when the beacon block is, like, set, like, it doesn't involve another API call where the proposer asks the relay, hey, now that the beacon block is set,

287
00:35:50.500 --> 00:36:02.069
Bharath: I need to sign the envelope, like, can you get me the envelope that requires another set of, like, API calls? I believe, like, sending the payload route and execution request route, like, like, lets us, like, avoid that.

288
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:07.250
Bharath: So, yeah, so this is, in my opinion, like, how it could look like.

289
00:36:08.290 --> 00:36:13.310
Bharath: And that's pretty much it. Like, I just wanted to, like, take the time to, like, just kickstart, like.

290
00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:29.309
Bharath: discussions on how the builder API could look like. There are some open questions. One is, like, how will the builders get the free recipient of the proposal? Today, we have the off protocol, like, validator registrations. Like, clients send validator registrations to the relays every epoch.

291
00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:48.500
Bharath: In some discussions, like, I think Porto suggested that, we could send the fee recipient along with the request for the execution payload bit, then the relay or the builder just, like, at that point, they have to, like, seal the block with the payment transaction if they're doing, like, off-protocol payments.

292
00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.779
Bharath: Or, they,

293
00:36:50.950 --> 00:37:09.800
Bharath: Or if they're just doing a trustless payments, then that's fine. Today, like, Justin suggested, like, adding a gossip topic to communicate all this. So I think this is kind of, like, open to discussion. Of course, like, the other question that I raised, will we support, like, off-protocol relays, or will clients only support talking with stake builders?

294
00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:21.520
Bharath: One thing I want to get out of the way is, like, I feel like, irrespective of whether we support off-protocol delays or not, it's generally useful to have a specification for how the builder API could look like.

295
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.910
Bharath: And of course, like, we can always make the design better and stuff.

296
00:37:25.170 --> 00:37:37.069
Bharath: So, yeah, that's just more information. I have a couple of design docs, and I've started just writing the builder specs for this. So, yeah, I think that's… that's… that's all I have for now. Any questions?

297
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:39.340
Bharath: Happy to, like… Stop.

298
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:46.889
Justin Traglia: Thank you for the presentation, Brah. There are some questions in the chat, but I think we're a bit limited on time for this call.

299
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:49.920
Justin Traglia: So, I suggest we take these offline.

300
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.010
Justin Traglia: Would that be okay?

301
00:37:51.010 --> 00:37:51.560
Bharath: Excellent.

302
00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:53.050
Bharath: Sounds like a blood.

303
00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.430
Justin Traglia: Okay.

304
00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:01.849
Justin Traglia: Thank you. Let's get into trustless payments. We only have 23 minutes to discuss this. Alex?

305
00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.530
alex: Yeah, thank you, Justin.

306
00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.860
alex: Yeah, so I think the question is, for most of the people on the call, probably already pretty clear, but maybe for some of the listeners not, so…

307
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.190
alex: I would summarize it as…

308
00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:32.550
alex: really, yeah, speaking personally, during DevConnect, perspectives came up of people feeling that it would make a lot of sense to split trustless payments and consider it apart, people saying that they weren't convinced that Trustless Payment was the change that should go into Ethereum.

309
00:38:34.690 --> 00:38:50.510
alex: And I guess ever since, I've been trying to, like, understand that myself, bring together perspectives, and see if we can resolve contention, because I will say that in my exploring, it's very clear that there's people that feel strongly it should not be in Glamsterdam, and there's people who strongly feel that it should.

310
00:38:51.060 --> 00:39:05.140
alex: So to keep things, like, realistic, I think the question that I'm posing here is, should trustless payments be removed from the Glamsterdam update? I also think, for purposes of a smooth discussion, it's good to keep staked builders in.

311
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:19.659
alex: there is actually perspectives that I've heard of people saying, no, no, like, Trustless could go out, but I think Stake Builders should stay in, so that is a branch. I want to note that, but yeah, I would just keep them together for now. I also really want to add still that,

312
00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:29.189
alex: both sides seem to want a better Ethereum, right? Like, whatever your view is, even. It's like keeping sides out of it. Whatever your view is for what should go into Ethereum, everyone involved.

313
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:52.349
alex: thinks that whatever their perspective is of what should happen is gonna make Ethereum better. I think Ethereum will be fine either way. I'm definitely not assuming, like, the hostile intentions for anyone or anything like that. Also good, I think, to say that, as Alex, I'm one of the people running the ultrasound relay, and so we're for sure biased, right? Like, whether we're right, that we think

314
00:39:53.160 --> 00:40:10.660
alex: not putting trustless payments into the protocol is good for us, yes, but also good for Ethereum is, I think, exactly the topic that people differ on, of opinion. So I'll, like, pause there. Yeah, I just want to make sure, like, is the question clear that I'm trying to ask?

315
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.600
alex: Yeah, I'll leave it there.

316
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:23.710
Justin Traglia: So yeah.

317
00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.200
alex: That's the…

318
00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:32.599
Justin Traglia: The question is clear. I mean, should we, remove… should we keep trustless payments or not, is essentially it. How are people feeling?

319
00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:43.049
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I can have a little comment, just to start up, so…

320
00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:50.870
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): as… as… from the core dev perspective, seems like trustless payment is… is… is…

321
00:40:51.930 --> 00:41:06.839
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): is a complete solution, gives everything in protocol, which makes sense end-to-end. What is probably unclear from our perspective, what are the downs… downsides, what are the…

322
00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:17.710
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): effects on the… on the… on the builder side, where… where actually are the pain points for you guys, to us to understand better your point of view?

323
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:28.509
alex: Yeah, okay, like, I'm happy to get into those. I think also even we may have some builders on the call, which could be interesting.

324
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:46.919
alex: Okay, so that's, like, I do want to highlight, like, from a lot of people, I heard that actually their major gripe was, the benefit is too small, so we shouldn't do it, and I know that that's… it's not that simple, that's actually a very complex position to take also. But then the next thing I often heard is, like, yeah, even if I agree with you, or agree with the perspective that

325
00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:54.260
alex: the benefit is small. I'm not sure what the downsides are. I wrote recently this ETH research post where I tried to get into it.

326
00:41:54.470 --> 00:42:02.080
alex: I feel like the biggest downside that is seen, but again, talk to people, you hear it's one of many, is that

327
00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:04.070
alex: the…

328
00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:09.469
alex: Introducing this new path?

329
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:19.949
alex: may mean that the out-of-protocol block-building market starts looking very different, and starts centralizing more. Like, in a way, what people are saying is, we're not expecting this

330
00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:33.299
alex: to help much in block building. We think it will be the same people building blocks, we think there will maybe be less people building blocks, you're actually reducing how many different people will be building blocks. And also, like, the barriers to doing it, the costs to doing it.

331
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:40.290
alex: may become higher. So what people will often say is, like, there doesn't seem to be a clear benefit, there does seem to be a clear cost.

332
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:55.050
alex: I'm trying to be mindful of the time. Like, in very, very short form, like, people feel that there's a kind of prisoner's dilemma, where if we introduce a trustless path, what will happen is people will use the trustless path. I will highlight there also that

333
00:42:55.270 --> 00:43:07.460
alex: proposers that refuse to use relays, I think, are gonna be better for trustless payments. I think they would get paid more in the future with this change. The only problem that many see is that

334
00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:29.940
alex: This may also mean that all builders become direct-to-proposer builders, and if all builders, or at least the dominant builders, become direct-to-proposer builders, there's really very little reason left for a relay to exist. So, if you felt like relays were doing anything of use, like, previously, then whatever you thought that the benefit was may go away, and like, you know, one of these obviously is to

335
00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:37.509
alex: Make sure that all proposers have, like, access to the same payment through, like, making builder competition very easy on a very wide set of proposers.

336
00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:41.479
alex: Yeah, I'll leave it there. Maybe there's still a builder that could, add in.

337
00:43:41.820 --> 00:43:47.100
alex: But, yeah, I'm curious to hear if that covers it, or if somebody wants to add something there.

338
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:54.199
george: Yeah, sure, I can speak. So, from Titan Builder. So, there's,

339
00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:59.030
george: A few angles here as to why we think there's a cost to the outer protocol blog building market.

340
00:43:59.190 --> 00:44:03.690
george: So, like, to continue on Alex's point on centralization, we think…

341
00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.959
george: That, having direct connections is potentially quite…

342
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:14.060
george: centralizing for the general builder market. If there's an advantage to connecting directly to validators.

343
00:44:14.210 --> 00:44:23.379
george: You then need to speak to validators to get connected, and I know there's been some discussion on that validators could connect to any builder they want. You get trustless payments, there's no issue.

344
00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.939
george: Our concern there is that…

345
00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:31.089
george: Payment is not the only thing that validators need. Validators have other preferences, for example, OFAC.

346
00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:36.540
george: And that requires something else other than a trustless bit. That requires, like, a personal relationship, some kind of…

347
00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:44.420
george: agreements, SLAs, etc. And so then that requires new builders to go in BD with all the big staking pools, which is just impossible.

348
00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.170
george: And then, would add the other part to…

349
00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:54.440
george: I think on to also your point, Alex, you said that relatives using trusted payments will get higher bids. I think it's actually the opposite.

350
00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:09.540
george: And I think the reason is that if we have an unconditional payment, there's now a risk to our bid. So, as a block builder, there's quite a significant amount of blocks where we as a builder take zero profit. We bid 100%, a lot of builders actually bid plus 100% on some blocks.

351
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:15.339
george: Currently, if there's some bug in our block, you know, things happen.

352
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:34.589
george: the, like, this gets validated early on in Optimistic Relaying, it gets pulled very quickly, and that normally is the bid that is not delivered. There's no… but, you know, if with direct connections and trustless payments, there's no verification, any bug we have in our code as a builder could potentially cause us to miss a slot, and if there's a, you know, 100 ETH block, we're gonna make zero profit on that.

353
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:41.739
george: There's a non-zero risk that we miss out, and we make zero profit, that's negative EV, and we're not going to bid that value. I think they're the two big ones.

354
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:48.180
alex: Yeah, maybe to clarify a little bit, so the… the… when I said…

355
00:45:48.260 --> 00:46:06.140
alex: a higher bid, that's from the perspective of the, I would estimate, maybe 7% of proposers, but maybe even less, that refuse to use release today and local block build. I think if you're local block building, this might result in a slightly better bid for you, but that's already a very small group, and this pushes the Overton window a little bit on this discussion.

356
00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:08.990
alex: A lot of people I've spoken to will say that

357
00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:17.430
alex: if that small group is the only one that moves, then does this make sense at all as a change to put in? Isn't there other stuff that is higher priority?

358
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.289
Justin Traglia: Data always?

359
00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:39.649
DA | Flashbots: So, there's kind of two parts to this argument that I don't understand. The first is that, like, if relays are adding a service, and that, like, if they're actually improving the experience, then it makes no sense to me that they would disappear. So, like, any relay who's actually a positive force in the space?

360
00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:41.590
DA | Flashbots: Should continue to be here.

361
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:51.510
DA | Flashbots: And… I'm trying to remember the second point, I don't remember.

362
00:46:55.290 --> 00:46:56.250
Justin Traglia: Alex?

363
00:46:56.650 --> 00:47:05.070
alex: Yeah, just maybe on the point of, like, why would a relay disappear? Because I think the intuition there is quite sensible, it is that

364
00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:18.609
alex: If you have public bids in relay auctions as you have them today, and I'm a builder, it becomes very natural for me to say, hey, what is the top bid in the network right now? I look at all the relays, and then I make a private bid directly to the proposer that, is, like, trustless.

365
00:47:18.610 --> 00:47:31.790
alex: Right, and if I do so, I can have a lower value block than the builder, but still get it on-chain. Because if I were to submit this same bid to the relay in the open auctions, a builder with a higher value block could see this new bid and say, oh, but my block is more valuable, and immediately outbid this bid.

366
00:47:31.790 --> 00:47:37.920
alex: But since it's, like, a trustless payment, this becomes, like, a lot harder to see. It's direct to proposer.

367
00:47:37.920 --> 00:48:02.100
alex: And it makes a lot of sense then that builders would say, well, you know, if you're not gonna bid with me in the same auction, but you'll use my public information to privately outbid me, I'm gonna go private as well. It makes a lot of sense. I think there's also, like, this is possible today. I also think if you ask me, on a very long-term timeframe, I think it's very possible that Ethereum goes there anyway, but at least it's not where we are today, and the out-of-protocol actors will say that we're quite happy with the equilibrium we have today.

368
00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:27.070
alex: But we think this undermines it, because the moment I, as a dominant builder, decide, shit, they're using my public information to privately outbid me directly to the proposer, like, I would do the same. I start no longer showing my bids, I start bidding directly to the proposer, and from there, like, there's small steps to where you would only be left with, at least the dominant builders bidding directly to the proposer, and then I can say just very concretely, us as a relay, our revenue comes from those dominant builders. If they bypass our

369
00:48:27.070 --> 00:48:27.950
alex: auction.

370
00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:36.060
alex: I'm not sure how I could pay for the server costs that we have today to run the ultrasound relays, so that seems kind of straightforward, at least that part to me.

371
00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:47.060
DA | Flashbots: I mean, we've already been approached by Relays who want to offer us sealed bidding, so if this is actually, like, the equilibrium collapse, then, like, it'll happen whether trustless payments exist or not.

372
00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:51.709
Barnabas: I don't think we should…

373
00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:59.890
Barnabas: I don't think we should pay for a middleware that Ethereum doesn't actually need, unless we essentially need them.

374
00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:07.160
Barnabas: So, like, why do we even need relays at all if every block, every bit, would just end up publicly?

375
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:08.020
alex: Yeah.

376
00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.560
Barnabas: minimum.

377
00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:19.019
alex: you know, like, I really like the sentiment, but I would also immediately say, like, I'm a little bit alarmed, because I feel like if you go to talk to a blog builder, they will explain to you very clearly why

378
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:31.820
alex: there is no expectation of the bids becoming higher towards the proposer. Like, I think the expectation is there would be fewer builders, those builders would have higher costs to do what they're doing, but it would be harder to compete with them.

379
00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:44.800
alex: Like, I like the sentiment of, like, why would we pay the relay if we don't have to? But at least from myself talking to builders, it really doesn't sound like you're gonna get higher bids, by the end of this.

380
00:49:45.530 --> 00:49:53.930
alex: So, and that's kind of my call to say, maybe we should explore this a little bit more, maybe, like, this part of the EIP hasn't been considered enough yet.

381
00:49:54.040 --> 00:50:00.590
alex: But I want to be careful there. It is also, to me, a difficult trade-off, and I can't predict the future, of course.

382
00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:09.879
george: Would that relays offer builders access to all of the stake?

383
00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:15.240
george: From the builder perspectives, that means any builder can access every single validator.

384
00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:28.809
george: And that, I don't think is true if you have, like, no relays. If you're having direct connections because of OFAC and other preferences, you are not going to have intermediate access to all the validator stake for any new builder that spins up.

385
00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:32.269
george: That, I think, is very centralizing for the building market.

386
00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:42.619
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I don't get that much the, oh fuck, Argument, because if… if…

387
00:50:42.620 --> 00:51:00.259
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I am a proposer, I want to go only with… directly with builder, and there will be a public knowledge that a builder starts censoring somehow, and I'm immediately excluded in my selected builder.

388
00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:11.600
Potuz: You're not understanding, Enrico. It's the other way around. The point is that the relay actually offers the fact that they are filtering OFAC transactions, and apparently proposers want this.

389
00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:14.460
Potuz: If you are in certain jurisdictions, and this is.

390
00:51:14.460 --> 00:51:15.239
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): The surveys that I'm.

391
00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:19.090
Potuz: Currently, we want to actually… this is an argument pro.

392
00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:26.220
Potuz: Removing trustless payments. Oh, the other way around. It's surprising to see this on the record on a public call.

393
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:46.900
george: So, validators want this. This is, like, they are going to connect directly to builders. So, they're going to choose to… these validators that want this, and there are validators that want this, because we saw, historically, ultrasounds, which is the most performant relay, and historically was head and shoulders above other relays, delivering the best bids.

394
00:51:47.250 --> 00:52:04.209
george: before they had OFAC centering for some validators, some validators were not connected to them, so some validators will not connect to the best bits. And so validators will want this. And so, to get this, validators are going to then connect directly to builders, and they're going to have an agreement with the top-end builders, and any new builder that wants to connect is not going to be able to connect to them.

395
00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:15.489
george: This is, like, this is not a good thing for the network, of course, but this is just, like, a fact of reality, and it's gonna enshrine some builders.

396
00:52:15.490 --> 00:52:17.190
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So it's a plus 1 for me.

397
00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.339
george: Is there a plus one to enshrined builders?

398
00:52:22.340 --> 00:52:25.189
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): No, I mean, to not have this guarantee.

399
00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:32.999
george: No, but it's gonna happen regardless, right? Like, whether we have trusted payments or not. What's the argument that validators won't do this?

400
00:52:34.770 --> 00:52:38.210
Barnabas: But they can still use the relay, right? Like, we're not…

401
00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:49.869
Potuz: I know that they're not going to use this. I mean, validators are going to go with… they do this now with a trusted player, which is the relay. And they were going to continue doing this with a trusted player, which are the builders.

402
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.510
Potuz: I mean, you might have been…

403
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:53.000
george: There's a key definition.

404
00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:59.109
Potuz: we don't want to help them do this. We definitely do not want the problem to actually help them.

405
00:52:59.970 --> 00:53:17.819
george: There's a… there's a key difference here between connecting to a relay that allows all builders, and connecting to specific builders. Like, it's economically rational for relays to have as many builders connected as possible, and to get the best bids. For a builder's perspective, it's not… I'm not gonna, like, send my bids to anyone else, right?

406
00:53:18.170 --> 00:53:31.869
george: And so, there's… you are… if you connect to one relay or two relays, you then get access to all builders and any builder that wants to connect. But for… if you connect right to builders, you don't. I think there's, like, a clear distinction there of why one is worse than the other.

407
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:47.129
Potuz: I think you're making a point about, like, builders being… not… not having access to proposers, which is true today in the system in which you need to make a BD investment to access proposers, which is something that relays constantly are posing about.

408
00:53:47.260 --> 00:54:00.199
Potuz: On APBS, this no longer exists. Validators are going to connect to whomever they… someone posts an address on-chain, they can connect to. And I agree with you.

409
00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.189
Potuz: This means that they need to trust people that they may not know.

410
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:22.939
Potuz: And the relays are offering this service of saying, we will actually do the filtering of OFAC transactions. Now, if this is put forward as an argument to why we… the protocol needs to support this system, I think we would be absolutely crazy to use that argument and actually support that system.

411
00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:31.949
alex: Right, like, and this part, I think I can see. What I guess I find more concerning is, like, if it's…

412
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:49.280
alex: does, there's a lot to explore there, but does reduce the number of builders that you will have available in the set, then wouldn't that be bad for the full proposer set? Right, there's a small group for which I think things improve, like, I can now get better bids, and it's good for this small group, but I imagine for the big group.

413
00:54:49.280 --> 00:55:09.209
alex: that is already trusting relays, and therefore getting access to the full set of builders that want to send bids to them, their optionality reduces in a way. Like, they get fewer builders now that they can source these higher bids from, and again, maybe that's fine, this is a pretty nuanced future to imagine or explore or weigh.

414
00:55:09.210 --> 00:55:32.850
alex: But it is something that I expect could very well happen. My second most likely scenario is that relays and builders will work very hard to make sure that most of the proposers don't use trustless payments, because then again, you can go back to having all builders compete through relays for all proposers. But again, that feels so, to me, like, counterproductive. We'd be investing to make sure that people don't use trustless, that

415
00:55:32.850 --> 00:55:35.359
alex: Feels like we're working against each other.

416
00:55:36.570 --> 00:55:39.930
Max: Oh, hi everyone, Max from the Asus Relay.

417
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:44.830
Max: I've recently joined the Sigma Prime team, to help them work with their builder.

418
00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:56.810
Max: I wanted to just chip in and summarize the argument here. From our perspective, ASIS is a quietly running small public goods-funded project, and we agree with the sentiment from

419
00:55:56.930 --> 00:56:09.499
Max: Titan and some ultrasound. We think the effect of EPBS in the long run is to… is to attract the builder market, and we think what you're going to find is that you'll have… Today, we have, you know, two dominant builders and a few others

420
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:20.999
Max: And a lot of experimental people, you know, trying their best to get into this market. What we worry about is that if the relay disappears, you remove open access to that market environment.

421
00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:26.069
Max: It will not be profitable to run a relay. Public goods-funded relays will disappear.

422
00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.120
Max: We certainly don't intend to put our capital on the line to, to keep the market

423
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:49.360
Max: open. I'm also kind of interested in the point which has been covered in the chat here, which is that, as far as I understand EPBS, it doesn't actually enforce any of this. You could build MevBoost again if the proposer is the builder. So, we're kind of having an argument about what the protocol should do, but it is not quite

424
00:56:49.830 --> 00:57:08.790
Max: the protocol. And until we clear up the design of the builder APIs, it's really difficult to give you a complete view of how we think the market's going to evolve. But there is a lot of… there's a lot of complexity here, there's a lot of complexity in scaling. What we would urge is a bit of caution, a bit more time to analyze it. Ideally, we'd see the EIP

425
00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:18.539
Max: split up, and so we can analyze this a bit more in the future. I'm not saying this isn't the direction we want to head in, I just think there needs to be a bit more time and thought put into it.

426
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.550
Max: Act.

427
00:57:23.120 --> 00:57:37.859
Matthew Keil: And this is the sentiment that we've gathered from a number of people after talking at, at DevConnect, is, you know, from an ethos perspective, and from a sentiment perspective, we really appreciate

428
00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:44.840
Matthew Keil: The protocolization of removing some of the external actors and their influence over the process.

429
00:57:44.950 --> 00:57:57.830
Matthew Keil: But the complexity of the idea is gonna build a lot of tech debt in that is gonna be incredibly difficult to remove if we do decide to come up with, better solutions.

430
00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:07.230
Matthew Keil: And really, this is the crux of the situation, is that while we agree in premise, and we really do want to see some action.

431
00:58:07.230 --> 00:58:25.800
Matthew Keil: We don't necessarily think that, doing anything is better than doing the right thing, and that there just needs to be some more research on some of these, more nuanced perspectives, because it's going to be very difficult in order to actually indo the enforcement

432
00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:42.879
Matthew Keil: of, this in-protocol flow, and we just have a feeling there's gonna be a ton of activity, in order to circumvent it, and we're gonna end up building a Ribs-Goldberg machine that is incredibly difficult to back back out.

433
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:59.399
Matthew Keil: And while we are extremely bullish and extremely, excited to see a lot of the slot restructuring and some of the timing, restructuring and the scaling, benefits, because there are a lot, like, POTUS has done an amazing job

434
00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:09.570
Matthew Keil: really looking at a very big picture, splitting the EIP into the two fundamental pieces, is the slot restructuring.

435
00:59:09.570 --> 00:59:12.380
Matthew Keil: And then a lot of the builder flow stuff.

436
00:59:12.430 --> 00:59:17.900
Matthew Keil: I think is just at least worth looking at from a…

437
00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:37.119
Matthew Keil: from a delivery perspective, and being able to do the DevNets, with a lot of the slot restructuring, which would give us time, or at least the first DevNets, which would give us time for some of the subsequent DevNets, to really hammer out the details of the trustless payment spec.

438
00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:42.539
Matthew Keil: In order to make sure it really is gonna be not only effective, but efficient.

439
00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:58.420
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I can bring the perspective of Stefan, who's working on it. I mean, his feeling is that it's the actual complexity implementing those things related to trust payment are not…

440
00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:00.820
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): that… big.

441
01:00:01.930 --> 01:00:07.889
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, that's why we are actually okay to have it in, because they are already in.

442
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:13.200
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And I think we did a lot of things in the past that…

443
01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:20.459
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): We can adjust and remove additional forks, there's no that much complexity.

444
01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.060
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): That we have to deal with if we want to…

445
01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:28.339
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): go in a different path, and I also think that

446
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:33.029
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): From another perspective, if the number of relays goes down, I think it's a sign of

447
01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:34.800
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): It's a good thing.

448
01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.649
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): If some release goes out of business.

449
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:45.910
Matthew Keil: No, and I totally agree. I mean, we've actually already got the code built in order to do some of this trustless payment stuff.

450
01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:59.909
Matthew Keil: As far as the state transitions, etc. But, and I will also say it does feel weird to be advocating on this side of the discussion. But I just want to take a pragmatic view of it.

451
01:01:01.150 --> 01:01:15.280
Matthew Keil: So, yeah, I think we're, you know, as a team, and I think a lot of the other people from other teams also agree that if, you know, we're going with the consensus, and we do feel like that, but we'd like to at least just

452
01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:18.559
Matthew Keil: Get it out in the world, to talk about it.

453
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.080
Justin Traglia: Notice.

454
01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:43.960
Potuz: I want to be a little bit pragmatic and to the point. I would just want to collect arguments to removing something that is SFI.

455
01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.630
Potuz: More than just…

456
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:55.020
Potuz: feelings about it. We want to have an actual argument to why we should remove this feature.

457
01:01:55.320 --> 01:02:07.460
Potuz: And yes, I hear… I heard a couple of them that are… that seem to be valid to me. It adds protocol complexity, true. It adds implementation complexity, true.

458
01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.710
Potuz: It removes this, property of,

459
01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:20.850
Potuz: validators that want to trust builders, to honor OFAC transactions, Yeah, that's…

460
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:27.539
Potuz: Perhaps. I mean, that's certainly true. Do we want to use this in the protocol? Certainly not.

461
01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:33.090
Potuz: And there's also this ill-founded statement about

462
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:43.150
Potuz: Doing this will enshrine builders. Yeah, we are definitely enshrining builders, but doing this will centralize the builder market, which is not only is…

463
01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:44.220
Potuz: like…

464
01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:59.139
Potuz: it's not really a founded statement, it's just a statement, but it's not… it's not explained how this is going to be the case. And it's also counterintuitive, given the fact that EPBS actually gives access to anyone to be a builder.

465
01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:08.799
Potuz: Removing trustless payment is not about, like, removing the option for a proposer to get a payment and be paid. This is more about builders and actual proposers.

466
01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:16.149
Potuz: Removing trustless payment also removes the option for someone to bill, to bid bids for someone else.

467
01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:28.260
Potuz: So, this proposal of removing trusted payment is mostly about removing the access to the builder market to people. And at the same time, we're arguing that keeping them will remove

468
01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:45.809
Potuz: access to the builder market to people. So I think this is very counterintuitive statement, and even if you don't agree with me, at least you should realize that this is not really proving the fact that we will centralize the builder market by allowing anyone to actually provide bids.

469
01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:53.009
Max: It's certainly difficult to prove it, but there are a large number of variables changing here all at once, and anyone who says that they can understand

470
01:03:53.180 --> 01:04:04.979
Max: how the equilibria are going to settle after this is, you know, it could not be telling the truth. So, you know, what I would propose is that we do things… we make changes in small chunks.

471
01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:23.900
Max: And we keep analyzing the situation, because I don't know any proposers who are desperate for trustless payment features at the moment. I think that this is coming well-intentioned from the protocol side, because we want to get rid of the relays and we want to minimize sources of trust. But there just doesn't seem to be a need to rush this right now.

472
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:40.470
Potuz: it's not only about this, it provides… I mean, the number of benefits of trustless payments are large, and we've documented many of them. It's not only about even trust assumption, it's about, like, resilience, it's about liveness, it's about getting access, it's about being able to remove

473
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:54.270
Potuz: self-building as a requirement, it's about scaling itself. So the number of good four proposals are good, and I'm not even mentioning here, because this discussion today shouldn't be about why to include them, it should be about why to remove them.

474
01:04:54.490 --> 01:05:04.440
Potuz: And that's why I want to point out that I want to hear arguments, strong arguments, as to why to remove something that we're all coding, and it's already specified, and it's already in spec tests.

475
01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:18.919
Potuz: So, I mean, if we are going to go into a discussion as to why to include them, I can just provide a huge list of arguments. This discussion today should be scoped as to why to remove them, and we haven't seen many arguments. We've seen even this OFAC angle as an argument.

476
01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:24.039
Justin Traglia: Agreed. Alex, and then Bruno?

477
01:05:24.850 --> 01:05:27.719
alex: Sure. Yeah, I just wanted to quickly say that,

478
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:47.139
alex: I appreciate the point that you were making about, like, how can we somehow formalize these arguments more, and then you said something about having them included in the SFI? Like, if you could say more about that, I'd be, like, very interested, because I think, yeah, having some of these written down and somehow clearly noted, at least, if we aren't, removing trust, this makes…

479
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.350
alex: sense?

480
01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:55.719
alex: But then, of course, yeah, I still, like, to my best estimation, I think it would make sense to not have trustless, and I…

481
01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:14.940
alex: the way I would phrase it is, for example, something we can say is, if there's a bunch of protocol actors now that say, trustless will not be used, it is not worth it to put these changes into Ethereum, then at least, to me, that sounds like a pretty strong argument, and I think also one where it's going to be very clear after the fact, once the new equilibriums are very clear.

482
01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:26.849
alex: clearer than today, whether people ended up using it and it was, like, a good use of our time, or whether, like, some of these things stay more speculative, and then you did give a list of, like, other benefits that you think there are.

483
01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:46.510
alex: Yeah, on that, I can only say that some of these that you named, I think, are also, like, contentious. There are other perspectives of people who feel like liveliness will not improve through doing this, or, like, censorship resistance will not improve, or maybe, like, there won't be more builders. But, yeah, I'm looking at the time, and I'm like, yeah, how can we ever go through all of it?

484
01:06:49.720 --> 01:06:50.330
Justin Traglia: Bruno?

485
01:06:50.330 --> 01:07:06.780
brunoflashbots: Yeah, I wanted to make a short comment. Like, trustless payments will happen, either off-chain or on-chain due to a free option. That's no ways to surround that. Even for optimistic relays, they will implement trustless payments. If they don't trust the builder, they will have to make their mistake.

486
01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:12.219
brunoflashbots: Otherwise, they can exercise the free option for free. So that, either way, will happen.

487
01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:15.320
brunoflashbots: So if it happens, why just not happen on chain?

488
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:22.180
brunoflashbots: So it's not a good… for me, it's not a very good argument against…

489
01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:25.949
brunoflashbots: Build decentralization, because, again, this will happen off-chain.

490
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:29.670
Justin Traglia: Lorenzo?

491
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:35.669
Lorenzo: I just wanted… Oh, one second.

492
01:07:37.650 --> 01:07:38.060
george: Great.

493
01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:53.490
george: Hey, sorry, I'm just gonna speak from George's mic. I think my point was to POTUS, where he was asking, like, for good reasons why the builder markets would be centralized, and I think there were a few that were discussed

494
01:07:53.700 --> 01:08:10.740
george: One would be that, because builders are now staked, they have to stake in advance the balance to bid, and then if they don't have the capital to bid, they wouldn't be able to bid. If there is a big volatility event, they would decide whether to bid lower, because otherwise there are no capital.

495
01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:19.180
Potuz: they need to stake only to be a validator. To bid, you don't need the stake. You can bid off protocol… we are… we agreed that we are going to implement.

496
01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:23.010
george: I was about to make that point. I was about to get to that.

497
01:08:23.410 --> 01:08:26.590
george: So… they can,

498
01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:42.349
george: Sorry, I lost my train of thought. So yeah, so if they do want to bid on-chain, they do need balance, and I think we all agree that to stay capital, and with the deposit queue, you maybe need, you know, one week or two weeks of bids, which can be, like, quite substantial, and also you need to be in advance

499
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:48.170
george: Deciding that you are gonna be a builder, and potentially a lot of builders bid for just a few number of slots.

500
01:08:48.260 --> 01:08:50.990
george: Now, if you do want to bid off-chain.

501
01:08:51.060 --> 01:09:09.649
george: You basically either bid directly with the proposer or bid through a relay. Now, we… I think we agree on this call that they will be more expensive to be a relay, and potentially relays will cease to operate. I think there were a few good points on that as well on this call already.

502
01:09:09.649 --> 01:09:27.959
george: And then the point is, okay, you can still bid with an off-chain bid to a direct connection with the proposer, and the point is that only a handful of builders would be able to do that, potentially, you know, 3 or 4 or 5 of the largest ones, but definitely not a random builder who can just decide to start up

503
01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:38.109
george: Because you need to get adoption from proposers, and it doesn't make sense if you can build just for one proposer, and then if you cannot build for many, then it just doesn't make sense to…

504
01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:40.830
george: To be an off-chain builder, so to speak.

505
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:47.450
george: I see Paulo shaking his head, so maybe there's a counter-argument.

506
01:09:51.470 --> 01:09:58.459
Justin Traglia: Otis, do you want to respond really quick, and then Bruno? No, no, no, no, Bruno's… there's people we can't read. Yep. Bruno?

507
01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.599
brunoflashbots: Sorry, sorry, it was, I did not want to raise a hand.

508
01:10:06.170 --> 01:10:10.789
Justin Traglia: No worries. Lorenzo? Or I guess he didn't have his hands up, he was just talking.

509
01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:26.509
Justin Traglia: Bruno, could you clarify the trustless payments?

510
01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.420
Justin Traglia: Thank Alex asked about it in the chat.

511
01:10:30.350 --> 01:10:40.500
brunoflashbots: Yeah, I think my point is mostly either the relay has trusted relationships with the builders, or they make them accountable by staking.

512
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:46.920
brunoflashbots: I would rather say I would prefer to have a permissionless set than a trust-me-bro relationship, so…

513
01:10:47.290 --> 01:10:48.360
alex: But, yeah.

514
01:10:48.650 --> 01:11:12.810
alex: Maybe, like, so this, again, it feels to me quite, like, maybe relays will be able to maintain the equilibrium of today, and they keep builders coordinated around doing what we do today, but it seems to me, like, if you do trustless payments and builders start doing direct payments to proposers, then there will only be a very small set of builders that is really good at this, the builders that pay the highest bids. So I think what you will see is that really only those small set of builders will be landing all of the slots.

515
01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:25.299
alex: And then from there, it just becomes very natural for this builder to say, hey, proposer, right now it's a trustless payment I'm making, but if you trust me, then I can give you a higher bid, because there's all kinds of, like, cost involved with doing these, like.

516
01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:42.080
alex: staked single bids that I can send per pub key over the P2P with, like, timing games that get more complex. Like, it makes a lot of sense to them become trusted. So what I predict will happen is that, yeah, for a small set of local block builders, they will go to Trustless and get those extra blocks, but for the massive set of proposers that we have.

517
01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:52.440
alex: They will build trusted relationships with a smaller group of builders than we have today, which to me, that sounds like more trust me, bro, not less trust me, bro.

518
01:11:59.110 --> 01:12:01.900
Justin Traglia: Bruno, would you like to respond before moving on?

519
01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:08.610
brunoflashbots: I mean, my point is that we'll… for small builders, I mean, again, relays will have to either

520
01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:16.009
brunoflashbots: so for, like, for small builders, you have to make them accountable, right? If they don't have reputation, you either make the mistake.

521
01:12:16.170 --> 01:12:21.159
brunoflashbots: or… Or you trust them, but to trust them, they must be sufficiently big.

522
01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:24.880
brunoflashbots: To statistically infer if they are exercising the free option or not.

523
01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:31.530
brunoflashbots: Therefore, they will stake. My point is, small builders, they will have to stake the release, either way.

524
01:12:35.530 --> 01:12:43.049
brunoflashbots: In either… if we implement it or if we don't, unless you will allow small builders to exercise the free option, which… that…

525
01:12:43.050 --> 01:13:04.609
alex: simulate your bid. It's not 100% necessary, and again, gets a little bit into, like, how much is this used on the protocol today, but today you can just send a block to ultrasound. If you don't have any stake, we'll simulate it for you, and then any block of any size you can offer to the proposer, because we'll take responsibility for it. And also, like, this, again, will change tomorrow, because then if we need to be staked for this as a relay onto the protocol.

526
01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:09.260
alex: then we have to do a risk calculation, right, and say, I don't know, I…

527
01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:15.319
brunoflashbots: The point is, I don't know if you can do that with the blobs. You can do this with the payload, but I don't know, I'm not sure you can do this with the blobs.

528
01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:24.849
alex: Yeah, we'd have to dem… well, we have to demand they send everything, right? And… I'm not sure.

529
01:13:25.210 --> 01:13:32.690
alex: Yeah, I guess I'm not well-read on this topic, I don't know exactly how you could withhold something of a blob when you send it to release, but normally you're expected to send all the blobs as well.

530
01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.559
george: If the argument on this is that…

531
01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:57.010
george: Yeah, sorry, the argument on, like, you can't send blobs is that the data is too high. There's some work implementations to fix this. So, one of the co-examples that's live now, actually, and a lot of relays, is that you can send deltas of blobs, so you only send a blob once. Blobs usually don't change, and so…

532
01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:02.730
george: You can stream the blobs in as the builder receives it to the relay, and then you don't have a networking latency cost as a builder.

533
01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:04.590
george: Submitting to a ruler.

534
01:14:10.830 --> 01:14:20.960
Justin Traglia: Okay, let's try to wrap this up pretty soon. Otis suggested that we do a temp check. I'm not exactly how that should be done. Stokes, do you have any recommendations here?

535
01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:28.210
Potuz: I'm not sure Alex is even listening.

536
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.100
Justin Traglia: Oh.

537
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.390
Justin Traglia: I think he's listening.

538
01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:33.389
Justin Traglia: He is messaging.

539
01:14:34.770 --> 01:14:40.829
Justin Traglia: Okay. Obviously, no decision will be made at this call, but yeah, temp check. Enrico?

540
01:14:41.700 --> 01:14:46.090
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, just one final thing, so… Very, very simple.

541
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:52.769
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Trust-trust payment does not prevent the status quo to continue.

542
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:56.169
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And I think we all agree about this.

543
01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:05.480
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, we are all talking about, we don't know where the equilibrium will be, After…

544
01:15:05.590 --> 01:15:21.940
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Which means, you don't know, you want to find the equilibrium, which means, let's provide all the options, and the equilibrium will be found. If we don't provide the whole spectrum, we are faking, because we are not providing the options.

545
01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:27.049
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, let's provide the options. Everything really remains on the table.

546
01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:35.160
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Options are more options, just more opportunity to find a new equilibrium, and let's… C.

547
01:15:38.090 --> 01:15:38.930
Justin Traglia: Ouch.

548
01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:53.050
alex: Yeah, maybe what I… I might sound a little harsh here, like, forgive me, but this is definitely, like, from the many people I've spoken to, this argument, I feel like I get a very harsh reaction from people that says, like, that is just not good enough for Ethereum.

549
01:15:53.050 --> 01:16:18.050
alex: If you want to make a change to Ethereum, it can't be enough that you're saying, hey, this is a new option that wasn't there before, and we don't really know what it will do in the future, so therefore let's try it. I will acknowledge that there's always unknown unknowns and things that we can't know, but Ethereum as a protocol a lot of people that I talk to will say needs to make changes that very clearly, lots of people want, like, basically yesterday, right? And we cannot be spending time on anything that is of the sort.

550
01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:42.989
alex: we don't really know what will happen. I guess we can't make a strong argument for why this would be used a lot of the time, so then we'll do it anyway. And I guess one more caveat is, but today this process is already really far. I've also heard that from a lot of people, and I think that's, like, a fair thing to bring up. But in general, for the process that we have for EIPs, I think a lot of people will have this strong visceral reaction of saying, like, there has to be a much stronger justification for doing something.

551
01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:44.350
alex: Like, trustless payments.

552
01:16:54.630 --> 01:17:00.440
Justin Traglia: Alex Tobes, We are going to talk about this at ACDC.

553
01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:02.099
Justin Traglia: Next week, correct?

554
01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:12.989
Justin Traglia: Okay, I guess no, Mike, he said yes. And a decision will be made then and there, and I guess clients

555
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:17.250
Justin Traglia: clients in the community should, I guess, review this call.

556
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:24.770
Justin Traglia: try to, like, listen to all the arguments, and maybe try to come to a decision themselves, and then speak up at ACDC.

557
01:17:28.980 --> 01:17:48.730
alex: Yeah, I guess on that note, also, like, thank you. A lot of people have been listening, I think also a lot of these perspectives are coming in very late to the process, and I can respect that that is frustrating, especially if you've been working on this for a very long time. So, like, yeah, I really appreciate that people are even having this conversation, like, this late in the process, and listening to what,

558
01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:53.720
alex: What people are bringing in, even if maybe some of these perspectives they find unconvincing.

559
01:17:53.780 --> 01:18:13.419
alex: And again, like, yeah, maybe, that's also immediately a call for, like, please keep doing that, that Ethereum is a very large protocol now with many, many users. I'm sure all of us wanted to have many, many, many more still. And then, really, we should be listening to what, all of those users, like, including proposers, but also end users, I think, want.

560
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:15.180
alex: Yeah, so thanks.

561
01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.829
Justin Traglia: Yep, thank you too.

562
01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.369
Justin Traglia: Does anyone have any last thoughts before, ending the call?

563
01:18:33.070 --> 01:18:36.250
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank everyone for attending. I will…

564
01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:40.849
Justin Traglia: Talk to you in two weeks, and at ECDC. Alright, bye everyone.

565
01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:44.540
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Bye.
