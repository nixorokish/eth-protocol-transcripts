across all

to get around the penalty
00:14:33	Barnabas:	Replying to "This feels super com..."

Penalty calculation would be part of forkchoice?
00:14:34	terence:	Replying to "This feels super com..."

state transition function can tell if its an orphaned block vs a block with missing committed payload

based on? if that’s what the proposer wants, i’m not sure i follow why we’d block them from doing so. happy to just take a link to prior writing by someone.
00:34:12	Dustin:	why have to sign the payload envelope? the builder should be signing
00:34:13	alex:	Replying to "interesting point ac..."

this is less my argument for what we “should” do, more what may create an incentive to fork clients 😅
00:34:27	nflaig:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

we shouldn't, I don't think there are any major changes required to builder api `getHeader` is still fine as is, just need to change the type

and we can get rid of `submitBlindedBlock` as it's not strictly necessary
00:34:32	Dustin:	I mean, sign something. but this is the proposer allowing its sig to be used
00:34:33	Potuz:	It seems to me that the agenda should have been changed...
00:34:37	terence:	thats for off protocol builder, i think he meant to sign the bid
00:34:41	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

How so?
00:34:55	Dustin:	Replying to "why have to sign t..."

I thought he specifically said the envelope, but ok, can be clarified
00:35:01	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

Doing trustless payments talk first?
00:35:04	Potuz:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

dealing with blinded objects does not make sense in the current spec, so this only makes sense to discuss if we move to unstaked builders
00:35:12	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

There are no need for blinded objects
00:35:27	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

That was a consequence of not having block payload separation
00:35:27	Lorenzo:	Replying to "why do you need to..."

could be both? builder has an incentive to invest in p2p distribution similar reasoning as https://github.com/ethereum/builder-specs/issues/119#issuecomment-3199858239
00:35:34	Dustin:	Replying to "It seems to me tha..."

yeah the unblinded one already goes out
00:35:40	ethDreamer (Mark):	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

Now that we have this, we can do relays without blinded objects
00:35:58	Potuz:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

yes it will be naturally both, but anyway the builder would want to wait for distribution
00:36:05	Potuz:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

before submitting the payload to p2p
00:36:28	Lorenzo:	yep meant the builder could help with the inital gossip of the signed header as well
00:36:40	Potuz:	Reacted to "yep meant the builde..." with 👍
00:37:12	terence:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

keep in mind consensus block is very small comparing to execution payload so p2p distribution optimization may not be necessary, we can do more testing here though
00:37:47	nflaig:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

yes, could keep submitting beacon block api as well to allow builder to help propagation
00:39:51	Bharath:	For off-protocol builder, the proposer acts as if they self-build. So the proposer is technically the builder. So the proposer needs to sign the payload envelope
00:40:24	Bharath:	Replying to "why have to sign the..."

In the case where the proposer talks to the staked builder, the proposer doesn’t have to touch the payload envelope at all

The whole ePBS doesn’t prevent people from going off-protocol, and we sfi ePBS mostly because of scaling benefit it brings by restructuring slot, not because of trustless payment

00:43:30	Bharath:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

I think we will have to blind the execution payload in the envelope when we talk to unstaked builders right? We don’t have to do payload blinding if we only talk to builders which are staked
00:43:48	Barnabas:	The reason we use relays is because we can’t directly go to builders.
00:44:01	Potuz:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

we hopefully never again need to talk to unstaked builders
00:44:18	Bharath:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

Yup me too, but I m not sure if that will happen
00:44:21	Justin Traglia:	It’s not really ePBS without trustless payments. The trustless payments isn’t really that complicated. Less trust in the system the better.
00:44:50	Potuz:	Wow I was not expecting to see the OFAC angle on the record
00:45:03	Eitan:	IMO Yesterday was a good example of why trustless payments is a good thing. When the circuit breaker triggered the network started producing local blocks. As local building becomes more expensive from a resource/bandwidth context this becomes dangerous. With trustless payments we’d never have to revert to local building
00:45:04	Bharath:	Replying to "It seems to me that ..."

The builder-api with staked builders stays the same as the status quo today. But with off-protocol builders, blinding will be required IMO
00:45:14	NC:	Replying to "It’s not really ePBS..."

00:48:15	christophschlegel:	If private bids are desired by builders, relays could offer them as well
00:48:35	Barnabas:	Why do we need relays?
00:48:38	Bharath:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

Also the builder will require the beacon_block_root to build the execution payload envelope
00:49:04	Potuz:	Replying to "Why do we need relay..."

apparently because validators want to censor OFAC transactions
00:49:18	Bharath:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

The builder could either listen to the gossip topic for the beacon block but getting it via the builder-api would be faster
00:49:42	Bharath:	Replying to "why do you need to s..."

The builder could broadcast the ExecutionPayloadEnvelope faster and also aid in beacon block disemmination
00:50:03	nflaig:	Replying to "IMO Yesterday was a ..."

but in case the network is unstable we might have less than 60% attestation quorum in which case payments cannot be guruanteed, so you would likely wanna local build anyways?
00:50:26	Potuz:	Replying to "IMO Yesterday was a ..."

you are guaranteed payments if they are included
00:50:44	Lorenzo:	Replying to "Why do we need rel..."

validators will censor whether there are relays or not
00:51:43	Dustin:	well, it's something that's touted in lists of MEV relays today
00:51:51	nflaig:	Replying to "IMO Yesterday was a ..."

but that's out of the control of the proposer, so it's no longer "trustless"
00:51:56	Dustin:	it's not really a secret some people want OFAC compliance
00:52:17	Potuz:	that's fine, but the protocol making protocol decisions to keep this service and favor it is absolutely crazy
00:54:14	Cayman Nava:	The current design of trustless payments is not enforceable and folks have noted that the mechanism won't always be used. Doesn't sound like a robust design. The EIP should split out the entire staked-builder and trustless payment flow to allow for more research with better properties. This will derisk the scaling benefits of the slot restructuring / block/payload split.
00:54:16	Barnabas:	We need to look at what is good for Ethereum. OFAC requirements is absolutely not a point of view Ethereum should ever consider. If it is, we have lost the battle.
00:55:15	Barnabas:	If you are here because you trying to protect your “business”. Or afraid that you going to go out of business because a feature that Ethereum wants to introduce to make the protocol itself better, then its also not something that Ethereum should need to worry about imo.
00:55:16	Lorenzo:	Replying to "We need to look at..."

I think this is missing the point, the point is that because (sadly) some validators are censoring, the effect will be a more centralized builder market
00:55:22	Potuz:	Replying to "The current design o..."

yea that’s not the worry. the worry is that it is good for proposers to be able to source blocks from many builders. and this will likely result in fewer builders.

00:57:02	Potuz:	ePBS is completely open, the arguments being put forward is that removing gatekeepers actually makes for a closed system and this does not make sense
00:57:07	Dustin:	Replying to "The current design..."

Speaking personally, scaling was secondary to me
00:57:15	george:	Replying to "If you are here be..."

would note that as a builder it is net better for us to be enshrined... What im saying here is that there are some validators that require preferences other than pure bid value and if there are no relays there to offer this service they will connect directly to builders and potentially enshrine those builders

fair point.  But there have been examples of proposers gatekeeping. So if we move the whitelist to proposers that I think worse
01:02:28	alex:	i will say i think epbs does a pretty good job of supporting trusted payments right now. still some open questions but i see little reason to bypass today. not sure we’d ever have to remove it as specced. i’d be more worried we keep implementing things we don’t need (contested).

ah, yea that is true. but you’re saying that is reason to build it into the protocol?
01:10:20	alex:	Replying to "Sorry, small caveat...."

that seems a bit of a quick decision 😅 . there is a lot we could build.
01:10:36	alex:	Replying to "Sorry, small caveat...."

if the cost was high i’d agree, but haven’t seen a clear argument why.
01:10:51	george:	relays can receive the full block so will be the one responsible for delivering the full payload

Yeah good idea.
01:11:12	Barnabas:	I haven’t got a single argument why the protocol shouldn’t have trustless payments implemented as an option. 

OFAC required validators are still going exist, and they can still use a relay, or they can go directly to a builder. This is fine. Ideally once FOCIL is around, all validators that require OFAC will just simply go away, as they actually are not a net benefit for the health of the network.

Prysm is for not removing trustless payments... (if some say they aren't they'll get yelled at)
01:14:06	nflaig:	Replying to "I haven’t got a sing..."

the claim for a long time has been that trustless payments is required for pipelining which is not true, so we never had a honest discussion about trustless payments and whether it's good to include it or not. But we are having that discussion now :)

01:15:29	stokes:	for a temp check, i’d be curious for each client team to say if they think we should keep as-is or take out trustless payments
01:15:39	Potuz:	happy someone is saying the obvious
01:16:02	stokes:	i think all of the community voices here say take them out (except for some of
the flashbots voices?)
01:16:08	terence:	is current status good enough for ethereum though?
01:16:18	Dustin:	Replying to "i think all of the..."

community voices == relay voices?
01:16:30	brunoflashbots:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

XD
01:16:30	Potuz:	Again the reasons to have them have been spelled out, the purpose of this meeting is to have a reason to remove them
01:16:30	Dustin:	Replying to "i think all of the..."

they're part of the community, yes
01:16:38	Potuz:	not to explain reasons to have them
01:16:43	DA | Flashbots:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

Flashbots has no set opinion.
01:16:46	Lorenzo:	Replying to "i think all of the..."

builders, node operators (few of them that i spoke to)
01:16:48	stokes:	Replying to "i think all of the c…"
relays, builders
01:16:50	Barnabas:	Reacted to "not to explain reaso..." with 👍
01:17:00	Dustin:	Replying to "i think all of the..."

oh I guess I counted Titan as both
01:17:06	stokes:	yes
01:17:10	Caleb:	the more options the better though, as long as secutiry can be guaranteed
01:17:21	alex:	right, would love to have this conversation. it seems v contentious which benefits it brings. i will agree they’ve been explored and shared by many previously 👍.
01:18:00	stokes:	Replying to "i think all of the c…"
yeah staking pools can also have a view on this
01:18:12	stokes:	Replying to "i think all of the c…"
i think @Potuz has been talking to lido tho
01:18:17	stokes:	Replying to "i think all of the c…"
as an example
01:18:35	Potuz:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

I have talked to a lot of community members
01:18:41	stokes:	Reacted to "I have talked to a l…" with 👍
01:18:42	Potuz:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

didn't want to bring them here
01:18:50	Potuz:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

because it wasn't about keeping them
01:18:55	Potuz:	Replying to "i think all of the c..."

but to find out why to remove them
