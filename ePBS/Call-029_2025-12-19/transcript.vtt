1
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.900
Justin Traglia: Good morning. Oh, sorry, good morning, Preacher.

2
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.289
Pooja Ranjan: Good morning, Justin, how are you?

3
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.770
Justin Traglia: I am good. I'm happy that this is the last breakout call.

4
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:52.949
Pooja Ranjan: Yes, we were discussing it, like, do you need permission to be the host from future? Then I mentioned that noted as the last call. Yeah, here comes Mark.

5
00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.410
Justin Traglia: Hey, Mark.

6
00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.569
Justin Traglia: Or… is that actually Mark? I mean, I recognize the picture, but EFZoombot.

7
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:16.719
Pooja Ranjan: I don't know if the bot has permissions or not, but I was chatting with Mark to grant you the permission to be the host, so yeah.

8
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.769
EF Zoom Bot: guys, yeah. Sorry, I hear it chattering in the background, too. I'm gonna make Justin the host now.

9
00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.130
Pooja Ranjan: Yeah, that would work.

10
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.460
EF Zoom Bot: Boom.

11
00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.060
Justin Traglia: Okay.

12
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.889
Pooja Ranjan: And I see your message now on Discord.

13
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.060
EF Zoom Bot: Yeah, yeah, I… I'll sort it out now.

14
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.400
Pooja Ranjan: Yep.

15
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.640
Pooja Ranjan: Mark?

16
00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.630
EF Zoom Bot: Yeah, cheers. I guess this won't be an issue anymore, given that this meeting will get wrapped into ACDT from, next year on.

17
00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.500
Justin Traglia: Yep, indeed. Cool. Thankfully.

18
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.940
EF Zoom Bot: Alright?

19
00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.489
EF Zoom Bot: Yeah, and then Zoom does this dumb thing where…

20
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.299
EF Zoom Bot: That references whatever account you have active on the… in the browser to decide who to log you in as on the app.

21
00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.160
Justin Traglia: -Oh.

22
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.879
EF Zoom Bot: It pulled my profile picture and logged in via the Zoom bot, so here we are.

23
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:07.500
Justin Traglia: That's funny.

24
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.930
EF Zoom Bot: Yeah, Zoom does all kinds of nonsense things, but

25
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.959
EF Zoom Bot: Go somehow better than the rest of the alternatives.

26
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.570
Justin Traglia: Yep.

27
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600
Justin Traglia: Sadly.

28
00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.879
EF Zoom Bot: Alright, I'm gonna jump off, have a good meeting today.

29
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.370
Justin Traglia: Alright, thank you.

30
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.840
Pooja Ranjan: Thank you, Mark.

31
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.869
Justin Traglia: Good morning, Akash.

32
00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.230
Akash | ECH: Hello.

33
00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.649
Justin Traglia: Good morning, everyone. Let's just give it a few more minutes before getting started.

34
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:13.139
Justin Traglia: One more minute, and then we'll get started.

35
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.370
Justin Traglia: Okay, Akash, could you start the stream, please?

36
00:11:43.630 --> 00:11:44.829
Akash | ECH: Yeah, we are live.

37
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.359
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

38
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:54.810
Justin Traglia: Hello, everyone. Welcome to EPBS Breakout Call 29. This is the final breakout call for ePBS.

39
00:11:55.090 --> 00:12:01.700
Justin Traglia: After which, starting in 2026, EPBS discussions will take place at ACDT.

40
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:12.429
Justin Traglia: Yeah. Let's just get right into maybe updates from client teams. Is anyone from… here from PRISM that could give us an update?

41
00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:27.239
terence: Not much. We're just waiting for the PR for the, state builder to be merged, so we continue making progress. I'm implementing part of it, the business state.

42
00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.470
terence: And, the… and the SSD status structure.

43
00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:43.910
terence: So, yeah, so I'm just waiting for the PR to merge, and hopefully we can get the release, and after the release, I can merge the PR, which should unblock the rest of the progress.

44
00:12:45.220 --> 00:12:49.819
Justin Traglia: Awesome, yeah. And, did you have an opportunity to check the reference tests?

45
00:12:50.110 --> 00:13:03.609
terence: I have not. It's much… it's much harder to do that versus just having, like, an official release, so I think I would just wait for an official release, and the… and the… also, no rush on that as well.

46
00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.310
Justin Traglia: Okay.

47
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:14.450
Justin Traglia: And, I guess we could plan on making a new release pretty much as soon as we get, like, this group of PRs merged. So maybe next week?

48
00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.340
terence: Sounds fair.

49
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:21.659
Justin Traglia: Okay, thanks. Is there anyone here from Lighthouse that can give us an update? If any update?

50
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.840
Justin Traglia: Shane Moore just joined. Shane, are you from Lighthouse? Could you give us an update?

51
00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:46.930
Shane Moore: Hey! Hey guys. Yeah, on the Lighthouse side, we just, merged the containers branch into our Unstable, so pretty, good milestone there. Then, I think Michael and Manas have actually just started taking a look at the fork choice-related changes, which is nice.

52
00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:55.450
Shane Moore: Mark is still, handling some, like, payload separation-type changes, and I'm tackling, payload attestations.

53
00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:59.900
Justin Traglia: Awesome. And that is a good milestone. Congrats.

54
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.290
Shane Moore: Thank you, thank you.

55
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.850
Justin Traglia: Okay. Anyone from TechQu here? I see a couple.

56
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:15.199
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, not that much. Updates. This week has been…

57
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:25.769
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Along with Raz, Stephanie is off, and yeah, the only… the last thing we were working on… actually, Mehdi was working on it.

58
00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:32.699
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Still related to, gossip validation rules that needs to be…

59
00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:38.779
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Redesigned a little bit to make it a better cross-fork.

60
00:14:39.370 --> 00:14:40.630
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Aware…

61
00:14:41.140 --> 00:14:47.830
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And, yeah, not that much progress still on that, so I don't know if Meli wants to add anything.

62
00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:48.930
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Probably.

63
00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:53.479
Mehdi Aouadi: No, that's basically it, yeah, I've been working on the Gossip player, so, yeah.

64
00:14:54.690 --> 00:14:56.030
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): So, yeah, that's it.

65
00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:59.310
Justin Traglia: Okay, and Stefan's been on vacation, right?

66
00:14:59.520 --> 00:15:05.609
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, it is, yeah, I think Lee will be back next year.

67
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:08.759
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And most of us will be starting…

68
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:14.680
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Going off from… from today, so… Yep.

69
00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.449
Justin Traglia: Expected. Same for me.

70
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:22.609
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you for the update. Is there anyone here from Nembos that can give us an update?

71
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.039
Justin Traglia: I don't think anyone from members sits here. Okay.

72
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:35.480
Justin Traglia: Lodestar?

73
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:44.980
NC: From Lostar's side, we got, concept topic, concert validation.

74
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.799
NC: We got the opt for… Seen cash, done.

75
00:15:51.710 --> 00:16:00.690
NC: And I'm… I'm personally looking at, data column sidecar and how to make that change, and also the block import, flow.

76
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:06.599
Justin Traglia: I'm sorry, the blocking portfolio?

77
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.859
Justin Traglia: What is that?

78
00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:08.930
NC: Yes.

79
00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.320
NC: So, basically,

80
00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:19.520
NC: Yeah, just basically, instead of just importing, like, a single block, you import the consensus block.

81
00:16:19.630 --> 00:16:24.770
NC: And then you have, like, this intermediate beacon state that we need to store somewhere.

82
00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:29.879
NC: And then you have the execution payload, come in, and do the remaining of the state transition.

83
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:33.829
Justin Traglia: I… okay, I misunderstood. Thank you, that makes sense now.

84
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.120
Justin Traglia: Okay, thanks.

85
00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.879
Justin Traglia: That's been help.

86
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:42.520
Caleb: Oh, hi, sir. Yeah, sorry, from Limbus. I missed that, sir.

87
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.690
Justin Traglia: August. Sorry, August, you can give an update now if you want to.

88
00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:59.800
Caleb: Yeah, so we've been working on integrating the payload attestations to the validator duties, basically. Then, on the one hand, we are waiting for the new spec release.

89
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:10.210
Caleb: And also, we have somebody working on… looking at the fork choice side of things, so basically, that's just it from us.

90
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:15.310
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you.

91
00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:19.419
Justin Traglia: And last, but not least, granting.

92
00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.510
Subhasish: Anyang, would you like to take it?

93
00:17:34.630 --> 00:17:37.550
hangleang: No, y-you can, you can… We can't speak.

94
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:50.390
Subhasish: Okay. Yeah, so, mostly, most of the PRs are in place, and we're in the process of, reviewing them. A new PR from the last week was, including the

95
00:17:50.570 --> 00:18:10.080
Subhasish: block at stations, and, I am personally answering, reviews on, some of the corrections, pointing at, food choice changes, and, yeah, so it's mostly, correcting and, reviewing the changes.

96
00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.140
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you, everyone.

97
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:25.609
Justin Traglia: I guess we can get started on some of the other agenda items now. The first one is code for HTTP endpoint.

98
00:18:25.770 --> 00:18:29.500
Justin Traglia: This is something that POTUS wanted to bring up. It's essentially the…

99
00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:39.419
Justin Traglia: the builder API endpoints that would be necessary for a validator to submit bids and stuff. I'm not actually sure if this makes sense anymore, if we plan on

100
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:41.820
Justin Traglia: Using, like, mountain…

101
00:18:42.050 --> 00:18:52.080
Justin Traglia: If we end up making builders not validators. I'm not the most up-to-date on this one. Maybe, Nico, could you give some more insights on whether or not this is something that

102
00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:55.519
Justin Traglia: Like, what is this, and… Should we be doing this?

103
00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:06.869
nflaig: Yeah, personally, I'm not that convinced it makes sense, to be honest, because usually, like, where you run your validators, so if you assume a solo stake as a beacon node.

104
00:19:07.140 --> 00:19:11.839
nflaig: I don't think you wanna pause that note to submit bits each slot.

105
00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:19.340
nflaig: Because there's, like, if you force the EL to build payloads each slot, it's gonna be a hit on performance.

106
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:28.250
nflaig: Especially if you think, like, long-term, if blocks are harder to produce, like the payloads, I really don't…

107
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.419
nflaig: Know if that even makes sense.

108
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:36.399
Justin Traglia: Yeah, I… that makes sense to me.

109
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.680
Justin Traglia: I think it's coming up.

110
00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:42.620
nflaig: Otus was mostly in favor of this, right? And Enrico, I think.

111
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:45.600
Justin Traglia: Yeah. Francesca?

112
00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.399
Francesco: Yeah, sorry, could you just restate exactly what is the question?

113
00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.870
Justin Traglia: Nico, maybe you'd be able to phrase it better than I could.

114
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:11.379
nflaig: So basically, the idea is that the beaker node would implement the builder functionality, where you implement the server side of the builder API, like the get header and the submit block API.

115
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:20.659
nflaig: So that's basically a case if you're a solo staker, or maybe, like, a group like Eve Staker, and you want to act as a builder.

116
00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:29.040
nflaig: That it's more accessible, or they can just run a client and don't need to run any relay or builder software.

117
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:43.920
Francesco: I mean, it seems nice maybe as an opt-in, like, anyway, you would need to be, even without the, fully staked builders, you would anyway would need to opt-in to the whole thing by depositing a builder.

118
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:52.939
Francesco: So if there was, like, just a flag or something to do this, it seems nice. It definitely seems weird if you were just building blocks for no reason without even having a builder.

119
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:57.000
Francesco: That you control, but… I don't know.

120
00:21:00.940 --> 00:21:01.710
Justin Traglia: Parents.

121
00:21:02.490 --> 00:21:03.730
terence: It's optional.

122
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:21.290
terence: Anyway, and we also have this today already, so I don't think it's, like, each… today we have the flag, right, that's such that you can, like, signal the CL client to basically prepare a payload every slot.

123
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:30.800
terence: And the builder's already using something like this today, and the difference is that we're actually implementing, like, this… we're opening the port, or…

124
00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:47.299
terence: having to handle it for the server, that's the only difference. But I think this could be optional. I don't think it's, like, a requirement that client must do this, but, like, if today, say, Nimbus or Lighthouse do it, then Buda can just use the Nimbus and Lighthouse

125
00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:49.369
terence: for this functionality.

126
00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.080
Justin Traglia: Breath.

127
00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.319
Bharath: Yeah, I mean, I would assume, like…

128
00:21:56.700 --> 00:22:11.350
Bharath: for clients, if they want to implement, like, I would assume, like, you know, proposers are not gonna whitelist, like, like, ETH Taker, like, solar validators and stuff, right? Because you… you would directly… the builder API would probably, like, whitelist the builders

129
00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.379
Bharath: Who, who you're gonna, like…

130
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.449
Bharath: call getHeader and get bid or whatever, right? I would still assume, like, a lot of the…

131
00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:23.139
Bharath: solo builders would… and you kind of need to trust the builder that, okay, like.

132
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:40.040
Bharath: it's a big enough builder that you know the URLs. Maybe in a future where the URLs are more, like, on-chain, like, I think the builder registry, which people are working on, maybe in that case, like, everyone can publicize the URLs, but today I would assume you would use the builder API for bigger builders?

133
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:49.349
Bharath: So, I mean, to me, like, I would… I imagine, like, small solo stakers would probably use the P2P gossip topic.

134
00:22:49.510 --> 00:22:52.510
Bharath: And, yeah, I mean, again, for the…

135
00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:56.910
Bharath: feels kind of weird for clients to implement, the Builder API, like…

136
00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.169
Bharath: the server side of the builder API.

137
00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:10.309
Bharath: I think the bigger question for me is, like, whether clients want to implement the… whether the clients want to absorb the entire, like, MavBoost, client-side implementation into

138
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:16.120
Bharath: The client, or, like, how they would want to do that So, yeah, just…

139
00:23:20.690 --> 00:23:32.609
Bharath: like, the clients can build blocks, but I'm not sure the implementation of the builder API, the server side, to send headers and the beacon block back, makes, like, sense to me, but yeah.

140
00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:39.269
Bharath: Because I'd assume, like, the smaller validators are not going to be whitelisted by most proposers, so yeah.

141
00:23:40.780 --> 00:23:47.139
terence: I think this is just probably optional, like, people can do it if they want to do it, so yeah.

142
00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.389
Justin Traglia: So I guess…

143
00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:53.320
nflaig: one consideration.

144
00:23:53.540 --> 00:24:02.590
nflaig: Would be if we separate the builders now, and they are no longer validators, you would not import the keystore and the validator client.

145
00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:08.369
nflaig: So in my mind right now, it's probably a separate process that you can run.

146
00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:10.949
nflaig: like, whatever, Lodestar Builder, and then…

147
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:21.229
nflaig: that only uses the SSE from the beacon node and, submits bids only via P2P. I'm not really sure about the API part, to be honest.

148
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.950
Justin Traglia: Terrence, you're still unmuted, do you want to say anything?

149
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:49.219
terence: No, I think… yeah, I don't think this is, like, really that big a discussion point. Like, people can do it if they want to do it, but I can support that, so yeah, I mean, this is not, like, this is not meant to be a requirement at all.

150
00:24:50.170 --> 00:24:55.310
Justin Traglia: Okay. Do we still need to standardize this, or specify it?

151
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.780
terence: I think it's a very low priority to do that.

152
00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:01.800
Justin Traglia: Okay.

153
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.629
terence: It's a very… it's… yeah, it's a nice to-have.

154
00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.149
Justin Traglia: Okay, cool. Let's just move on to the next topic, then.

155
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.150
Justin Traglia: Unless anyone has anything else.

156
00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:23.350
Justin Traglia: Okay. The next topic would be, a PR on proposer preferences. I will share the link right now.

157
00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:38.000
Justin Traglia: Sorry, yeah, this is a way for, validators, proposers, to share their fee recipient and gas limit preferences to builders before

158
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.009
Justin Traglia: The proposal slot.

159
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:45.230
Justin Traglia: I think it's pretty simple. It's via a gossip topic.

160
00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:53.360
Justin Traglia: Fair, The structure is pretty minimal. It includes the proposal slot, the proposer index.

161
00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:57.499
Justin Traglia: Few recipient gas limit, and maybe something else I forget.

162
00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.219
Justin Traglia: You would only submit these to the network,

163
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:09.249
Justin Traglia: The epoch before you're proposing, so it'd be, like, 32 messages per epoch.

164
00:26:09.550 --> 00:26:11.129
Justin Traglia: Which is fairly minimal.

165
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:19.040
Justin Traglia: And, I recently changed it from Proposal Epoch to Proposal SWOT, so now if…

166
00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.829
Justin Traglia: You're lucky enough to have,

167
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:29.100
Justin Traglia: multiple, proposals in the same epoch, you would send two messages now, or multiple messages now.

168
00:26:29.770 --> 00:26:33.260
Justin Traglia: It just kind of makes it a bit easier to check and to verify.

169
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:34.659
Justin Traglia: I know.

170
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:43.940
Justin Traglia: I guess this is just a request for people to review the PR, and maybe on this call right now we can come to an agreement on whether or not this is something we…

171
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:45.610
Justin Traglia: Want to merge?

172
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:47.619
Justin Traglia: Or intend to merge.

173
00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:51.320
Justin Traglia: After it's been properly reviewed.

174
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:53.679
Justin Traglia: What do people think about this?

175
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:04.339
Justin Traglia: Nico says, in favor of having this.

176
00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:15.960
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, I mean, it makes sense to me to complete the whole protocol.

177
00:27:16.220 --> 00:27:21.360
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Right, this is a… this is a missing piece to be everything without any API.

178
00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:22.970
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Cool, right.

179
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:28.760
Justin Traglia: I think so, too.

180
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.589
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, so, I mean, it makes total sense to me.

181
00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.310
Justin Traglia: Breath?

182
00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:48.649
Bharath: adding one thing about this is… so we send the… I think it's not an issue, but we send the preferences for epoch E plus 1. If a builder, like, comes, like, if a builder is live, like, becomes active in the previous epoch, like…

183
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:57.729
Bharath: and hasn't received the preferences, the builder won't be able to build… won't know the preferences for Epoch E Plus One. And I guess that's fine, I mean…

184
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:05.580
Bharath: Like, unless we want to have a way for that builder to be able to fetch those preferences, but that just seems too complicated to me.

185
00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:07.010
Bharath: Yeah.

186
00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:09.710
Justin Traglia: I agree. I think it'd be better just to, like.

187
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.549
Justin Traglia: Force them to wait another epoch before actually submitting bids.

188
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:17.290
Justin Traglia: Or they could… yeah, that's… really, that's the easiest solution.

189
00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:26.140
Bharath: Yeah, otherwise I'd assume, like, you'd have… clients would have to store the preferences, and you'd have to, like, have a request response or something, which just doesn't make sense.

190
00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.220
Bharath: But, yeah, I just wanted to…

191
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:35.529
Justin Traglia: to put… I suppose you could spin up the, like, builder node before the, builder actually becomes active.

192
00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.259
Justin Traglia: So, I mean, maybe it would have this information anyway.

193
00:28:41.230 --> 00:28:44.379
Bharath: Yeah, I mean, it's just subscribing to a gossip topic, right?

194
00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.889
Justin Traglia: Yeah, there's not too much.

195
00:28:47.130 --> 00:28:47.880
Bharath: Yeah.

196
00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:49.030
Bharath: Yeah, I mean, I think.

197
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.430
Justin Traglia: And it…

198
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.790
Bharath: that, like… Say?

199
00:28:52.910 --> 00:28:55.300
Justin Traglia: I was… I'm sorry, I was gonna say that,

200
00:28:56.090 --> 00:29:00.620
Justin Traglia: Non-staked builders could also use this gossip topic if they wanted to.

201
00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:05.919
Justin Traglia: But I guess it's not as useful.

202
00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:06.950
Justin Traglia: But yeah.

203
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:13.649
Bharath: Yeah, but… Yeah, I don't think we know if they'll even, like, exist, or we'll even support them.

204
00:29:14.270 --> 00:29:19.879
Bharath: I think that's probably a different problem, but… but yeah, I mean, it's just like listening to a gossip topic, so you have to do that.

205
00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:21.820
Bharath: Just wanted to raise that, like…

206
00:29:23.560 --> 00:29:24.490
Justin Traglia: Okay.

207
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:31.749
Justin Traglia: It sounds like there's support for this, so please take some time to review it when you can, and I'll try to merge it after I…

208
00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:38.190
Justin Traglia: After it's properly reviewed and approved, and I, making these suggested changes.

209
00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:39.920
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

210
00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:49.850
Justin Traglia: Okay. The next topic is, a bid forwarding threshold. I just shared the link in the chat.

211
00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.679
Justin Traglia: This is kind of like a DOS prevention method, or like a… something to help with, like.

212
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.400
Justin Traglia: Preventing DOSes.

213
00:29:58.940 --> 00:30:12.730
Justin Traglia: This PR would change the forwarding threshold, so, like, currently it's, is the bid value greater than the current, or the previous highest bid value? And this could be as small as… as small of a change as, like, one way.

214
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:28.059
Justin Traglia: This PR would make it to where the new bid would have to be, like, n percent more valuable than the previous highest bid. In the PR, I have 3%, but we could change that to 1, 2, 5, like, whatever makes sense to us.

215
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.900
Justin Traglia: I think it should be fairly low, though, so… Keep that in mind.

216
00:30:36.150 --> 00:30:38.660
Justin Traglia: I forget what the remarks about it were.

217
00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:42.710
Justin Traglia: I know Quasar Builder had some…

218
00:30:44.450 --> 00:30:49.159
Justin Traglia: What do people think about this? Maybe builders? Lorenzo, do you have any opinions?

219
00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:54.299
Lorenzo: Yeah, I think maybe 3% would be a bit high.

220
00:30:54.560 --> 00:31:00.559
Lorenzo: I don't have a good feeling, it's just when there is a very, like, high-value blocks, then…

221
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:02.910
Lorenzo: You know, bidding in increments of, like.

222
00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:09.870
Lorenzo: 3% seems very high. I mean, I do see the anti-dose vector, but… Yeah.

223
00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:14.049
Lorenzo: Not sure if there's, like, a set number that is ideal.

224
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.850
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

225
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.669
Justin Traglia: I'm not sure what the correct number could be, either.

226
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:26.190
Justin Traglia: Okay. How do other people feel about this? Is this something that we want, or…

227
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:28.449
Justin Traglia: Aren't we fine without it?

228
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.319
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I think something like that needs to be in.

229
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:39.640
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Definitely in favor.

230
00:31:51.930 --> 00:31:53.480
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you.

231
00:31:53.750 --> 00:32:01.690
Justin Traglia: Please take… or Francesca said, does it matter if the increase is high, the expected usage of this is more just a fallback?

232
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.229
Justin Traglia: I'm not sure. I mean, I think it sort of matters.

233
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:09.450
Justin Traglia: Lorenzo?

234
00:32:09.790 --> 00:32:10.880
Justin Traglia: Did you answer that?

235
00:32:12.510 --> 00:32:23.560
Lorenzo: No, I think… well, if the goal is just to have an anti-DOS, then… because we bid so frequently anyways, and likely wouldn't use P2P anyways, so yeah, it's just a fallback.

236
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.930
Lorenzo: But…

237
00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.720
Lorenzo: it's still… I can imagine some cases where we have to use it. In that case, it would matter. It's just…

238
00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:37.989
Lorenzo: It's something maybe you don't use for, you know, 99% of blocks, and then you use for that single case.

239
00:32:38.490 --> 00:32:45.660
Lorenzo: So that's why the… Yeah, yeah, it wouldn't happen for high frequency reading, definitely, it's just…

240
00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:51.449
Lorenzo: you know, the proposal set will be quite varied in general, so I could imagine some blocks will have to use it.

241
00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:53.980
Lorenzo: Even though that's not ideal.

242
00:32:56.060 --> 00:32:57.950
Justin Traglia: Okay, thank you. Terrence?

243
00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:16.630
terence: Yeah, so I think on the implementation side, this is also, like, highly configurable in a way that, like, we can just quick hit once it goes live. I mean, we can start, like, seeing it with a reasonable number, and then once we see DOS, then we just…

244
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:24.199
terence: notify everyone to tweak the number to be higher, and that will likely solve it as well. So that's another way, yeah.

245
00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:31.450
Justin Traglia: Yeah, that might be a good suggestion, too. We could decide to, yeah, keep it in our pocket and only use it.

246
00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:35.469
Justin Traglia: Or only, suggest people use this if necessary.

247
00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:45.029
terence: Oh, I mean that we have to use it, but it's just a number, it's like, we can always change it to a higher number later on, yeah.

248
00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:47.599
Justin Traglia: Oh, I see. Okay, sorry.

249
00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:57.589
Justin Traglia: Okay, it sounds like there's general support for this. Maybe we can chat about it some more on the PR. Please take some time to review it.

250
00:33:57.690 --> 00:33:59.300
Justin Traglia: Enter, approve it.

251
00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:07.600
Justin Traglia: Okay, let's move on to the final topic, the non-validator builders.

252
00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.649
Justin Traglia: I'll share the link in the channel.

253
00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.010
Justin Traglia: We're in the chat.

254
00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:17.450
Justin Traglia: Okay, this is the big change that we've all been sort of working on this week.

255
00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.489
Justin Traglia: After speaking with builders, like, for the past couple weeks.

256
00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:33.789
Justin Traglia: We learned that they prefer to avoid the deposit queue and, rather than receive rewards on staked,

257
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:37.930
Justin Traglia: state to ETH. Like, faster deposits is more important to them.

258
00:34:38.330 --> 00:34:46.749
Justin Traglia: And also, I guess, minimum, or sorry, smaller, staking requirements. So, like, 1 ETH versus 32 ETH is more capital efficient.

259
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.849
Justin Traglia: Yeah, so we spent a bunch of time working on a PR for this.

260
00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:57.330
Justin Traglia: I think a lot of people have reviewed it. I'm generally in favor of it.

261
00:34:57.690 --> 00:34:59.380
Justin Traglia: What do you all think?

262
00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.000
Justin Traglia: Aaron's thumbed up, Nico's thumbed up.

263
00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:32.699
Shane Moore: When I read the non-validator builders, description on the GitHub Ethereum PM, it does say, like, however, we don't want to lose the fallback of P2B biz from actual validators. I'm just curious why we would lose that if we did this design.

264
00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.740
Justin Traglia: Yeah, that is the one negative of this, I guess.

265
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:43.790
Justin Traglia: Yeah, so, like, normal validators wouldn't be able to submit bids like they were… like they could in the current spec.

266
00:35:44.570 --> 00:35:47.230
Justin Traglia: Is your question, like, why is that? Or, like, why.

267
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.550
Shane Moore: Yeah.

268
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.519
Justin Traglia: lighting that.

269
00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:49.609
Shane Moore: Just because.

270
00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:58.059
Justin Traglia: Because, they wouldn't be part of the builder set, like, in this state, so they would have a different set of indices.

271
00:35:58.310 --> 00:36:02.169
Justin Traglia: And, the only thing they could do is self-build.

272
00:36:03.130 --> 00:36:03.740
Shane Moore: Okay.

273
00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:09.189
Shane Moore: lose the fallback mechanism of, being able to do P2P bids, basically.

274
00:36:10.110 --> 00:36:10.739
Justin Traglia: I know the P…

275
00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.430
Shane Moore: Yeah.

276
00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:16.839
Justin Traglia: I mean, the builders would still be able to submit peer-to-peer bids.

277
00:36:17.310 --> 00:36:18.010
Shane Moore: Okay.

278
00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:23.300
Justin Traglia: To be clear. Like, it would just be a… a different staking actor type.

279
00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:27.779
Justin Traglia: Like, it just wouldn't do… it wouldn't have validator duties, pretty much.

280
00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.559
Shane Moore: Okay, yeah, I'm following you.

281
00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:37.739
Justin Traglia: Yes, correct. Francesca said anyone could put down 1 ETH and become a builder.

282
00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.399
Justin Traglia: And it would be, very quick. Nika?

283
00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:58.440
nflaig: Yeah, just to me, it's not really clear, this argument, that any validator would be a builder. Just from technical perspective, it doesn't make a lot of sense for your validated client node to also produce blocks each slot.

284
00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:07.480
nflaig: Because really, I mean, right now, to me, it makes way more sense to have this separated, and it's also cleaner from a key management perspective.

285
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.469
nflaig: And, run this on a different server, or at least different process.

286
00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:22.180
nflaig: So, I'm really wondering, like, who would be that… those validators that… that we are talking about? Because I don't really even see who would be doing that.

287
00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:33.479
nflaig: And if they want, they, yeah, they can just deposit the one EVE, which should be small enough, for people running early days.

288
00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:41.359
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, I see the argument that the hardcore…

289
00:37:41.730 --> 00:37:45.839
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Ethereum guys that really wants to do that anyway won't be.

290
00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:51.840
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): blocked by… The need of a depositing…

291
00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:57.649
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): an if, and essentially spin up the validator, well…

292
00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.870
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): new week. Be careful for that.

293
00:38:02.590 --> 00:38:05.360
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Probably the only downside would be that…

294
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.840
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Since this use case is very… would be…

295
00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:14.390
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Less use and require in…

296
00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.760
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Some implementation on client side, probably very few clients will be implementing this.

297
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:31.200
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): While the other world… Would have been much easier, but… Yeah, aye, aye.

298
00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:39.409
nflaig: But is it really easier? Because for me, like, I don't want the node that is validating to also doing the bidding.

299
00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:42.469
nflaig: I kind of find it nice that it's separate now.

300
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:48.400
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, I get this argument, but technical… the technical implementation would be…

301
00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:54.489
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Different, because then you have to, handle this new special…

302
00:38:54.900 --> 00:39:04.749
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): validator, and you have to have this additional key management on the validator client that is delegated to that only, so it's…

303
00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:09.559
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I don't know if the detail, but my gut feeling now seems that

304
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:13.410
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): This is a more special case than before.

305
00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:18.499
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I might be wrong.

306
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:28.239
nflaig: Yeah, I mean, I'm also not sure if the code for that should even live on the beacon node side, because then you need to handle different cases.

307
00:39:28.690 --> 00:39:35.529
nflaig: only needs to do the proposal concern, right? Acting as proposer.

308
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:41.529
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): just needs to expose the API for sending stuff over the B2B.

309
00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.830
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Man, only that.

310
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:54.409
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): it's currently self-bending doesn't require to send anything on the P2P side, so a Bitcoin node won't even…

311
00:39:55.230 --> 00:40:00.960
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Doesn't even require to have, the… bid gossiping.

312
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:04.580
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I mean, descending part.

313
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:09.690
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): If… Doesn't want to support, builder.

314
00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:10.790
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): flow.

315
00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:27.239
nflaig: Yeah, I guess the idea could be that it's just a sidecar software, the builder, and we could still implement that as a client, and then you just use the Beacon API to submit the bid and listen to SSE events and stuff.

316
00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:32.869
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Yeah, it just… we just probably need to standardize the API on that side.

317
00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.410
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): the bid API for the publishing bid API on the Beacon node.

318
00:40:40.510 --> 00:40:43.950
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): And, yeah, maybe events, related events.

319
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:48.770
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): Once we do that, becomes much easier.

320
00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:58.910
Justin Traglia: Okay.

321
00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:10.060
Justin Traglia: Francesca has asked for me to summarize the open questions left on the PR. The first one that comes to mind is, it's not really open anymore, but we just made a decision.

322
00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:23.309
Justin Traglia: on whether or not builders should use withdrawal requests or voluntary exits, and I think we've come to this decision that we want them to do voluntary exits, because it's a bit simpler and less risky.

323
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:27.249
Justin Traglia: For them, so that they can continue using their,

324
00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.850
Justin Traglia: Execution address, wallet, account, whatever you want to call it.

325
00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.590
Justin Traglia: For other stuff, too.

326
00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.889
Justin Traglia: The other questions would be…

327
00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:45.680
Justin Traglia: One second… POTUS said something about git index for new builder.

328
00:41:46.370 --> 00:42:05.039
Justin Traglia: He said, flagging this function as a possible problem, don't have it clear yet, but it's something that clients may want to discuss in the breakout. We typically have a global public key to index mapping cache for signature validation, and this type of reusage would make it… make this cache a little more sensitive to be in sync with the head view.

329
00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:08.639
Justin Traglia: Not against this, just flagging as a possible shot in our foot.

330
00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.909
Justin Traglia: Or… I don't entirely understand, I will share a link.

331
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:18.320
Justin Traglia: In the chat.

332
00:42:21.210 --> 00:42:24.650
Justin Traglia: I'm not sure if there are any other open questions, Nico?

333
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:32.619
nflaig: Yeah, I was also looking at that, when looking how to implement the builder separation, and

334
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:40.760
nflaig: In my mind, like, if we have the index reuse, it might be fine to just get the pub key and the index conversion from the state directly.

335
00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:43.940
nflaig: And not use our pub key to index cache.

336
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:47.659
nflaig: I think it might be fine if the list is not too large.

337
00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.310
nflaig: So I guess that's the concern.

338
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:54.999
nflaig: Because our pub key to index cache is basically append only.

339
00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:58.900
nflaig: While I think that doesn't work if you have index reuse.

340
00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.969
nflaig: Or it gets more complicated.

341
00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.360
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

342
00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:12.180
Justin Traglia: In the chat, Francesco said, builder exits take 18 days, so not sure that really counts as sensitive to be in sync.

343
00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:13.570
Justin Traglia: Ciao.

344
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:21.029
Justin Traglia: Yeah. Also, I guess that's a good question, or a good question to bring up, like, is 18 days reasonable?

345
00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:23.139
Justin Traglia: Like, could this be less or more?

346
00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:27.979
Justin Traglia: And it's just, like, a nice round number, 4096 epochs.

347
00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:30.640
Justin Traglia: 4096.

348
00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:35.490
Justin Traglia: Okay.

349
00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.000
Justin Traglia: Review that in the PR.

350
00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:40.279
Justin Traglia: I guess the only other…

351
00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:56.429
Francesco: Sorry, maybe just one thing to say here is just to say, like, why do we even have this number? Because in principle, like, builders are not actually state, and you could think that they could exit immediately. So just for, you know, other people, they maybe didn't, like, read the whole discussion, the purpose of this exit period.

352
00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:06.240
Francesco: is mostly to… Basically, Put at least some cost to someone just depositing a bunch of

353
00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:16.700
Francesco: stake and then withdrawing it, like, to kind of just blow up the stake, which, I mean, in part, that's mitigated by the… if we have this reusing of the indices, that somewhat mitigates it.

354
00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:27.209
Francesco: But still, like, you could still, I don't know, deposit, like, 100,000 ETH in, like, one ETH increments, and just create, like, 100,000 indices, which may or may not be reused.

355
00:44:27.210 --> 00:44:30.940
Francesco: And kind of permanently… Potentially pollute the state.

356
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:45.379
Francesco: And so at least this puts, like, some cost that you can just immediately withdraw it, and just have loaded the state, for, like, you know, one day of depositing and withdrawing. But it's not clear that this is the best way to do this, or, you know, this number is kind of…

357
00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:53.250
Francesco: yeah, just pulled out of a hat, so I don't know. It feels like this is something that maybe we should still… I mean, it's fine for it to be like that, but…

358
00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:59.840
Francesco: Keep it in mind, this purpose, maybe it's still worth discussing, like, is this actually the best way to do this? And, you know, otherwise, what could we do?

359
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:06.030
Justin Traglia: Yep, and worth mentioning that this is possible with validators today as well.

360
00:45:06.380 --> 00:45:13.039
Justin Traglia: You just send one ETH to the deposit contract, and it would create the validator indexey and keep it in the state.

361
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:19.130
Justin Traglia: How do people feel about this? Clients, Debs?

362
00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:32.610
Justin Traglia: Okay.

363
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:42.629
Justin Traglia: There was one other open question, I suppose. A comment from Mikhail.

364
00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.760
Justin Traglia: About whether or not we should add,

365
00:45:47.580 --> 00:45:52.029
Justin Traglia: Check prior withdrawals in the builder's… in the builder withdrawals loop.

366
00:45:52.600 --> 00:46:00.180
Justin Traglia: I was arguing that… It's unnecessary, because, like, it's impossible that… Wow.

367
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:03.679
Justin Traglia: Their balance would be lower than the expected amount.

368
00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:12.200
Justin Traglia: And, I've read the entire argument, but he's suggesting we add it. If you have an opinion on this, please comment on the PR.

369
00:46:22.180 --> 00:46:22.870
Justin Traglia: Yup.

370
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.970
Justin Traglia: I think that's it. Maybe, Francesco, am I missing anything?

371
00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:41.859
Francesco: Not that I can think of right now. About the point from before, I just wanted to add, I think, one difference with the validator loading thing is that

372
00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:56.079
Francesco: I think, if I remember correctly, like, you can't withdraw validators unless it's become active first, so you do need to deposit… like, you can blow the state with one ETH, but if you do want to get it out, you have to first deposit another 31 ETH.

373
00:46:56.280 --> 00:47:05.449
Francesco: So that makes it a bit, like, at least if you want to get the money out, you will need, like, more of a… more of a budget to make this attack. But yeah, it's not like…

374
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.580
Francesco: Fundamentally different, I guess.

375
00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.539
Justin Traglia: No, I forgot about that, you are correct.

376
00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:16.729
Francesco: But yeah, other than this, I'm not sure, I don't have something else in mind.

377
00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.570
Justin Traglia: Okay.

378
00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:22.460
Francesco: Ms.

379
00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:23.279
Justin Traglia: Oh, wow.

380
00:47:24.010 --> 00:47:30.339
Francesco: Actually, sorry, Lee, I want one more thing. Let me just say… I mentioned this on Discord, but just in case to say it here, so I think…

381
00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.700
Francesco: Most of the four-choice pack.

382
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:41.430
Francesco: is what it is, and it's gonna stay how it is. I mean, of course, you know, people are welcome to review and point out problems, but, like, at least I wouldn't expect it to…

383
00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:57.739
Francesco: to change greatly. It's been like that for a while. There is some sort of, like, things around the edges that I do plan to change, and yeah, someone asked me to link the changes today. I didn't get to that yet, but it's somewhere on Discord, I'll link to it after.

384
00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:02.559
Francesco: the call. They're kind of old, so it's… yeah, I think they still pretty much…

385
00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:14.819
Francesco: like, the fortress pack hasn't changed, so it's still gonna make sense, but things around it have changed. But yeah, it's more stuff around, let's say, edge cases of the trustless payment stuff.

386
00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:30.160
Francesco: But at least the main, you know, get head and, how the, basically Block 3 works with payloads and all this stuff, like, should stay as is. And most of, also, pretty much all, yeah, most of the stuff around,

387
00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:35.969
Francesco: how do you use the PTC, and, like, all these things are changing… are the same, just what should change is…

388
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:47.589
Francesco: some things around, like, what exactly do proposers do, and a little bit of, like, how a testers interact with this, but yeah, I would say don't worry about it too much. Just, like, maybe don't…

389
00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:55.030
Francesco: You know, maybe think too much yet about the defined details of this interaction, because some things will… will…

390
00:48:55.030 --> 00:49:08.209
Francesco: yeah, will change in this, in this PR. And, I mean, yeah, I can also, like, I can link to the discussion that existed about this before, where it's already kind of explained why these changes are, and yeah, what the purpose is.

391
00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.149
Justin Traglia: Thank you.

392
00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:22.870
Justin Traglia: There is one more open question, I suppose. It's about whether or not a builder should have a withdrawable epoch field.

393
00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:29.679
Justin Traglia: personally, I don't think this makes sense, but again, please.

394
00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:32.570
Justin Traglia: I'll share link, one second, sorry.

395
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.170
Justin Traglia: Please comment.

396
00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:50.420
Justin Traglia: I think a builder… sorry, I'm quoting Kyle here. I think a builder should also have a withdrawable epoch. Once the exit epoch is reached, the builder becomes inactive, cannot bid, and then until withdrawable epoch, the balance is frozen on the beacon chain.

397
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:55.600
Justin Traglia: Without that… without that freeze, the DOS protection isn't as strong as it can be.

398
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.019
Justin Traglia: And I stood something like,

399
00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:07.729
Justin Traglia: The builder can't submit a bid if it's initiated an exit, which is sort of a freeze. So, should be the same thing.

400
00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:09.510
Justin Traglia: Yeah.

401
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.270
Justin Traglia: Yep.

402
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:20.340
Justin Traglia: For that PR, that's all. Seems like there's support, so if…

403
00:50:20.650 --> 00:50:28.179
Justin Traglia: If you have time, please review the PR, approve it if you agree. If there's a sufficient number of approvals, I'll merge it.

404
00:50:28.890 --> 00:50:38.369
Justin Traglia: I still do need to make the withdrawal request versus voluntary exit change, but I can do that, like, probably in 20 minutes, like, after this breakout call.

405
00:50:39.970 --> 00:50:43.449
Justin Traglia: And then, yeah, after these PRs get merged, I'll make a release.

406
00:50:44.340 --> 00:50:47.889
Justin Traglia: I can do that just whenever… whenever it's ready, pretty much.

407
00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:56.200
Justin Traglia: That's all of the planned agenda items. Is there any other topics?

408
00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:57.820
Justin Traglia: People want to bring up.

409
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:05.649
Bharath: One thing is,

410
00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:11.370
Bharath: we do have, like… like, I've been working on the initial, like, builder API specs, but…

411
00:51:12.430 --> 00:51:21.740
Bharath: But yeah, it's… it's in… I think it's in, like, a decent chip for a review, but I believe, like, people can start reviewing it after the…

412
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:28.420
Bharath: stake builder's PR gets merged, because there's some dependencies with that, especially the builder index and stuff, so…

413
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.829
Bharath: Yeah, but just, like, want to put that out, like…

414
00:51:36.750 --> 00:51:37.959
Justin Traglia: Yep, thank you.

415
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:41.420
Justin Traglia: Anything else?

416
00:51:51.820 --> 00:52:02.919
Justin Traglia: Okay, let's end the call, then. Happy holidays, everyone. Enjoy the time off, and see you at ACDT in 2026.

417
00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.620
Justin Traglia: Alright, bye, everyone.

418
00:52:11.620 --> 00:52:12.600
Enrico Del Fante (tbenr): I'll…
