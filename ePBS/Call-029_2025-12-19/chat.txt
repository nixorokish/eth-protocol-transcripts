00:19:21	Justin Traglia:	Also sorry, forgot to share the agenda: https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1835
00:20:01	terence:	+1 im confused what the request is
00:22:10	Justin Traglia:	Is this something we need to standardize/specify?
00:25:21	Justin Traglia:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4777
00:27:00	nflaig:	in favor of having this
00:29:47	Justin Traglia:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4792
00:30:40	Stefan Starflinger:	Reacted to "https://github.com/e..." with 👍
00:31:29	Yassine Ferhane:	Reacted to "https://github.com/e..." with 👍
00:31:47	Yassine Ferhane:	In favor
00:31:54	Francesco:	Does it matter if the increase is high? The expected usage of this is more just a fallback
00:32:39	Francesco:	Yeah that’s what I mean, I wouldn’t expect high-frequency bidding to happen there
00:32:51	Francesco:	Replying to "Yeah that’s what I m..."

And if there’s a case when bidding must happen through p2p, I guess we take the hit
00:34:10	Justin Traglia:	https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/pull/4788
00:35:16	Lorenzo:	strongly in favour from the builder side
00:36:05	nflaig:	just deposit 1 ETH if you want that
00:36:31	Francesco:	And anyone could now put down 1 ETH and become a builder
00:37:55	Francesco:	Hopefully client teams can run 1 ETH builders 👀

At least Potuz lol

00:38:18	Colin Kelly:	For the X% greater than the previous bid, are block builders fine with having to potentially "cancel" prior blocks by submitting a higher bid?
00:38:51	Lorenzo:	Replying to "For the X% greater..."

Yes that's expected
00:38:57	Colin Kelly:	Reacted to "Yes that's expected" with 👍
00:39:32	Colin Kelly:	Replying to "For the X% greater..."

oh I'm surprised they're fine with it. But thats great then.
00:40:06	Lorenzo:	Replying to "For the X% greater..."

Unless I'm misunderstanding your question, this is exactly what happens every time you bid higher no?
00:40:16	Francesco:	@Justin Traglia could you summarize open questions on the PR, if any?
00:40:24	Justin Traglia:	Replying to "@Justin Traglia coul..."

Yes

00:42:46	Francesco:	Builder exits take 18 days, so not sure if that really counts as “sensitive to be in sync"
00:43:49	NC:	It really depends how much this p2p bids mechanism is used if we need to have pubkey/index cache for builder
00:45:03	Colin Kelly:	Replying to "For the X% greater..."

Oh some builders exposed to CEX txs might need to quickly remove the CEX txs from their blocks if the tx is no longer wanted by the CEXs. And since the block no longer contains the CEXs its at a much lower value.

00:47:00	Lorenzo:	Replying to "For the X% greater..."

I see, but the issue is that actual cancels would not be enforceable anyways in p2p. Since there's no way to invalidate your prior bid

00:49:34	Francesco:	What’s the purpose?
