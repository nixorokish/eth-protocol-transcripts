00:14:31	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Whats the relationship between non-synchronous nodes and malicious nodes?
00:15:52	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

There is no distinction, theoretically speaking.
00:16:10	Ellie Davidson:	Reacted to "Whats the relationsh..." with 😃
00:16:26	terence:	@Mikhail Kalinin is this almost the same as fast confirmation mentioned in this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00549
00:16:36	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

Yes!
00:16:42	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

Sg, this is a big plus then
00:16:51	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

So that beta param would be able to account for either?
00:17:06	Mikhail Kalinin:	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

it is, heavily based on the FCR work
00:17:06	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

Yes.
00:17:13	Francesco:	Reacted to "Yes." with 👍
00:17:21	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

And so we’re basically able to parametrise “how synchronous” the network is required to be
00:17:48	terence:	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

cool, prysm has an implementation, i think lighthouse and nimbus are currently implementing them through EPF
00:17:57	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

I thought FSF==FCR
00:18:03	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

What’s new/diff?
00:18:09	Francesco:	Replying to "@Mikhail Kalinin is ..."

It’s just a renaming
00:18:11	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

Essentially, yes.  Beta must include both the nodes that could be malicious AND the nodes that could be slow.
00:18:19	Mikhail Kalinin:	yes, but with no distinction between malicious and non-synchronous nodes. Also, there are some moves that are available to  adversary that aren’t for non-sync nodes. Like publishing its attestation to a fraction of a network at a certain time
00:18:23	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Reacted to "It’s just a renaming" with 👍

00:19:25	Mikhail Kalinin:	Reacted to "cool, prysm has an i..." with 👍
00:19:36	Francesco:	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

If we were just worrying about slow nodes, we could probably improve the result (though haven’t thought about it much)
00:19:44	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

So dishonest resistance is strictly stronger than non-sync-node resistance - even better then

00:20:23	Marcin:	So after this, the block is "final final" or is there a way for it to not end up on canonical chain ?
00:21:07	Francesco:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

It’s not final as in “guaranteed to be finalized” or equivalently as in “it can only be reorged if 1/3 of the stake is slashed”
00:21:17	Luca Zanolini:	Replying to "Whats the relationsh..."

Non-sync nodes might disrupt liveness (kind of omission fault?), byz nodes might disrupt both safety and liveness
00:21:36	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Reacted to "Non-sync nodes might..." with 👍
00:21:38	Francesco:	It is final (in the sense of “guaranteed to stay canonical and eventually be finalised”) given the assumptions, which are stronger than for economic finality
00:22:08	Ed Felten:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

Perhaps a term other than “finality” makes sense to use, then.
00:22:32	Ed Felten:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

… so people don’t assume that it can never deviate from the eventual EF finality.
00:23:00	Ellie Davidson:	Reacted to "… so people don’t as..." with ➕
00:23:03	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	Reacted to "… so people don’t as..." with ➕
00:24:13	terence:	there's also the synchorny assumption as well (plus the 25%)
00:26:20	Luca Zanolini:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

The notion of finality is wrt the model. In a synchronous model (like the one Mikhail presented), this is finality and a block is final. If you do not have synchrony, you are outside the model that you need to be able to talk about this notion of finality. If you do not have synchrony, you need a stronger notion of finality, eg, economic finality which offers guarantees even under asynchrony.
00:27:28	Francesco:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

To that I’d add that “synchronous” does imply it cannot be equivalent to an asynchronous notion of finality, though I agree that this might not be obvious to all consumers of the rule
00:27:37	Francesco:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

(Although I think the intention is to be very clear on what the assumptions are)
00:28:16	Luca Zanolini:	Reacted to "To that I’d add that..." with 👍🏻

00:30:51	Ed Felten:	Replying to "So after this, the b..."

Ethereum does have a notion of finality that is enshrined in the protocol. My point is that people might naturally assume that that “finality” means “finality on Ethereum” when discussing protocols like this.
00:31:15	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	We lost you

Trying to understand where Compose comes into the picture there
00:57:06	Ed Felten:	What is the trust assumption about the shared publisher?
00:57:26	Marcin:	So any kind of rollback issue for a single chain, means that other chains have to roll back too ?

00:57:51	Ed Felten:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb..."

Same question for liveness: if one chain loses liveness, what are the implications for other chains?

00:58:07	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Reacted to "So any kind of rollb..." with ➕
00:58:28	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	‘Publishing block to L1’ is about DA then?
00:59:01	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb…"
Yes. We count on the fact that ZK proofs can become real time the next 24 months so we can make it completely permissionless (any rollup can join).
Until then there will be a curated list of rollups + an integration to Base, OP, Arb and others
00:59:38	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "So any kind of rollb..."

What about L2-local reorgs?
00:59:41	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb…"
@Ed Felten chain specific liveness doesn’t depend on other chains. Only cross chain Txs
01:00:21	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb…"
@Orest Tarasiuk (t1) as long as the  sequencers include the txs a local rollback shouldn’t impact other chains
01:00:50	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb..."

This is the unfortunate implication of any sync composability that does not require real-time proving.  Rollups need to settle atomically.  

Though I think that this design is neat because it is using essentially settling for these rollups on their behalf.  So instead of requiring Base to settle with Arbitrum, they are using a ZK proof of this settlement.  There is a small chance that this new settlement doesn’t match the true settlement, though (as far as I understand it)
01:00:58	Ed Felten:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb..."

If one chain loses liveness, what happens to messages sent to it, and what happens to messages that others are expecting it to send?
01:01:36	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "So any kind of rollb..."

Agree with Ed, if one chain loses liveness that seems to mean the other chain also loses livens (or the sync composability guarantees are broken)

Only cross chain tx liveness compromises not the ability of the sequencers to progress (blocks contain regular txs as well)
