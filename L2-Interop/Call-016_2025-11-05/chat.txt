I think it’s most useful to structure a property like this as a security requirement like “the protocol must not lose safety if L1 experiences censorship or finalization delays of up to one [or 7] day” as opposed to making it about the challenge time parameter.
00:20:50	Potuz:	7 days doesn't even include the time to sync a node: it assumes you have a synced node already.

00:30:50	Joshua Rudolf:	Curious for thoughts on V’s idea + conclusion here
To solve both of these problems, I would highly recommend a mechanism where any security council member can flip a switch to extend the delay to 7 days or even longer. This ensures 1-2 day withdrawals in the normal case, but gives enough time to resolve issues when they do arise. For the same reasons as above, 1-2 days is enough time for the fastest member of a security council to be able to flip that switch, even if an exceptional situation happens.
Because of the above, I would argue 1-2 days is enough to deal with any problem other than a 51% censorship attack on Ethereum.
00:30:57	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Also if nothing chan..."

Isn’t that orthogonal?

00:34:02	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "Curious for thoughts..."

But you only need 1 tx to flip the switch instead of many for an interactive proof (and you don’t need to be staked like you do in the fraud games).
00:34:06	Ellie Davidson:	We know that a 1-day challenge period is less secure than a 7-day challenge period.  The question is whether we are willing to accept that risk for stage 1s in particular in return for some benefit.  If we take the extreme, and we had proof that making this change would lead all users to use canonical bridges instead of trusted third party bridges, then it would be very worthwhile.  So the question we should be asking is how confident are we that this change results in a meaningful outcome?
00:34:09	Joshua Rudolf:	Anyone want to represent the perspective of solvers/intents/lps/bridges? Feel free to jump in I see we have folks here from Across, Hyperlane, others
00:34:27	Yorke | Hyperlane:	Reacted to "But you only need 1 ..." with ➕
00:34:30	Potuz:	Replying to "Curious for thoughts..."

yes, in the challenge case you also need just 1 tx: as soon as 1 tx comes in, you can increase the window automatically to 7days
00:35:17	Potuz:	Replying to "Curious for thoughts..."

So the initial window size only cares about 1 tx in any case, the total size of the challenge protocol cares about depth etc... but the withdrawal window is only about 1tx censorship

From conversations with MMs and CEXs this would be very meaningful, especially for small chains. If it costs ~ $30mm of capital reserves to subsidize fast withdrawals for chains with 7 day withdrawal times, that # goes down to ~$4mm. That's huge for smaller chains and would absolutely encourage usage of canonical bridges
00:37:08	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "We know that a 1-day..."

Solvers are okay, though, because they use native assets.  It’s trusted multis bridges with synthetics that are the problem.

00:38:54	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	Replying to ">So the question we ..."

Also this has an outsized benefit for small chains with low liquidity and centralized chains. This is indeed good, but arguably any chain with real traction would have enough capital incentives for MMs to add liquidity. For larger chains (where most TVS is), this is not that big of a benefit as sophisticated solvers don’t need to rebalance frequently. E.g. If 1 ETH sent from Chain A → B && 1 ETH sent from Chain B → A, nothing needs to be rebalanced.
00:38:55	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to ">So the question we ..."

I’m not sure that is enough data, at least from my perspective.  By how much does that reduce fees?  Are those fees necessarily cheaper than multisig bridges?  Do users even know about these lower fees?  Or will they just keep using their usual bridge?  I don’t think more capital efficiency necessarily leads to more canonical bridge use.
00:39:03	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to ">So the question we ..."

It might, but we need more data to confirm that.
00:39:03	karl:	To be clear, at least in OP's case lowering the withdrawal times for fault proofs is a near term improvement as ZK tech improves

The goal is to get more users to not use trusted bridges.  If solvers can now serve more users because of this, that is great, because solvers are not trusted.  But if it doesn’t change the number of users using trusted bridges, then what are we gaining?
00:44:12	Tomoki Adachi | Futaba:	Reacted to "Does it matter if en..." with 💯
00:44:17	Noah’s iPhone:	If you want to drop it to an hour you can use ZK proofs though. We have already seen some optimistic rollups switch and that lowers the cost of capital rather than these small rollups needing another council so would the cost of paying that additional council be greater than the cost to just switch to ZK proofs?
00:44:18	Ellie Davidson:	Replying to "Does it matter if en..."

Yes capital efficiency is good, but I don’t think that is the goal we have here.

00:45:49	Potuz:	Replying to "FOCIL fixes this :p"

not the underlying problem: what this group is proposing is to add a new trust assumption to rollups: "51% of validators are honest". Which rollups currently do not have. FOCIL would not change this, FOCIL anyway relies on 51% honest validators. The difference that FOCIL makes is in the economic attack assumption

Yes, exactly. You can basically think of the canonical bridge being forced to handle the net transfer of funds, not each transfer. The more directional flows are, the more your costs converge to the cost of the canonical bridge.

00:53:01	Noah’s iPhone:	Replying to "If we believe Ethere…"
Yeah my main concern is around the smaller chains and this basically makes them PoA. Also why now if it was possible in the past?
00:53:41	Tadeo:	Replying to "Re LP: sure, but you…"
Right now they are subsidised because without intervention liq would be near zero. So I'd say we should see more if incentives/payments are maintained, or less but still demand driven liquidity (right now it's based on how much the issuer is able to rent)
00:53:55	donnoh | L2BEAT:	interactive makes a difference for the economic attack because the defender needs to split its budget across many tips
00:53:57	matt:	Replying to "Theoretically but - ..."

Not sure I agree. I think these 7 day wait times impose a hard limit on how efficient directional flow can get (once subsidies are gone).
00:54:42	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "Unless there’s a coi..."

Yeah - so if you’re big (binance) then you stand a higher chance of NOT having to rebalance—and would thus benefit from a delay reduction less than smaller players
00:54:51	matt:	Replying to "Theoretically but - ..."

Fundamentally, if there are net outflows from a chain, somebody must have funds locked in the canonical bridge and that capital costs something.
00:54:51	Paul Dowman:	If it is a 51% attack that we want to protect against then it probably should be a lot more than 7 days.
00:55:30	Gabriel Coutinho de Paula:	Important observation: the resource exhaustion attacks possible on BoLD and OPFP are not a property of all interactive fraud proof algorithms.

That is, there are interactive fraud proof algorithms that don’t have resource exhaution attacks (but have other tradeoffs).
00:55:31	Joshua Rudolf:	Reacted to "Yeah my main concern..." with 👍
00:55:39	Ellie Davidson:	But it’s about the effect of the 7 days.  The argument is not about what security properties L2s should ideally have—it is about that the current security properties are actually decreasing the security for users because they use trusted bridges instead.
00:57:05	Potuz:	That's about the total challenge not the withdrawal window
00:57:07	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	@Ellie Davidson lowering settlement for stage 1, may dissuade stage 2 because the regression on the product side

Yes, I agree!
00:57:44	matt:	Replying to "Unless there’s a coi..."

It’s an interesting question. It might be the opposite. Smaller players offload their net flows to larger players (i.e. solvers offload their net flows to binance or Across LPs).

So it may end up being Binance that gets hurt the most, since they are left holding the bag with large net directional flow to rebalance.

Now Binance may have a large enough balance sheet on each chain s.t. they don’t care, but in theory their capital also costs something.

This was mentioned in the OG post, but the idea is that optimistic rollups should move towards 2/3 or ZK rollups to move to stage 2.  But I worry that that is a bigger burden than we are giving it credit for.  ZK proving is expensive.

Hmm, I had understood that the claim was that reducing the withdrawal delay was primarily for capital efficiency / reducing inventory risk.

I think that there is an appreciable improvement for liquidity providers in moving from 7 days to 1 day - I think it’s easy to model this.

But for the end user, I think the calculation is different - there’s a max delay that a user will accept, otherwise skipping the delay justifies increased bridge risk, so 7d -> 1d doesn’t matter as much as it does for LPs.

I’d expect Binance to have priced this in long ago in the quote they’re offering to the small guy, plus fee ofc

The idea is that if it is better for LPs, then they will lower fees, which will make more users use them, which is great because liquidity bridges are not trusted for end users.  So capital efficiency plays a role, but only if we are confident it will change user behaviors.  🙂

01:03:03	Ellie Davidson:	My personal view is that we should go all in on 2/3 proving.  That is the best end goal.  If some stage 0 L2s want to trial this, I’d be open to that, but we shouldn’t lose focus on 2/3 proving.  And I think we’re close to that from a technical standpoint!

Agree, I don’t think you can say it’s 7x cheaper to the user. I think it mostly depends on what percentage of the flow is netted vs directional.

100% netted, this makes no difference. 0% netted, it’s 7x cheaper.

Binance only supports very large chains. This is a much larger problem on chains where there isn’t an entity like Binance that has a balance sheet so large that capital costs don’t matter to them.
01:03:32	Ellie Davidson:	There are economic incentives to work out for rollups upgrading to 2/3 from optimistic proofs, but I still think that is the best outcome.

The budget being split among different attackers. If it's just about the griefing ratio I kinda understand but this is modelled equally with one or a million, the budget is what matters

no i consider the attacker being a single aggregated attacker, by sybil attacks i meant posting multiple invalid state roots. i couldn’t elaborate much but both my presentation and article explain it

the “sybil attack” terminology comes from the cartesi paper

That’s why I think it’s riskier to allow them to do stuff like this

Shouldn’t the difference be in the validator stake, proportional to the value locked in the chain, and not in the withdraw delay?
