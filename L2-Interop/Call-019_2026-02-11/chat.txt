00:24:05	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	So the L2 will act as a mempool?
00:26:21	Orca 0x:	can you link to the whitepaper?
00:34:10	Ellie Davidson:	What the difference between 7888 and Arbitrum’s cross chain broadcaster?
00:37:24	Ellie Davidson:	Which TG chat for this?
00:37:30	Ellie Davidson:	The Intents and Resource locks chat?
00:39:02	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	❤️
00:45:15	Ellie Davidson:	This seems very similar to CIRC / SCOPE.  What is the difference between this design and those designs?  :)
00:46:44	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Is the sequencer doing the simulation? And then validity is enforced when they submit a ST?

Thanks!
00:48:25	Jude's MeetGeek Notetaker:	You have a few minutes left for this meeting, as per your calendar. Learn more about what I can do at https://go.meetgeek.ai/learn
00:48:34	Friederike Ernst:	@Ellie Davidson It is similar to SCOPE! We only saw it today — Martin looked at it in detail I think, he may be able to comment.
00:48:52	Friederike Ernst:	@Alon Muroch | SSVLabs yes, the block builder does!
00:49:09	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Block builder needs to be shared between the rollup and L1?
00:49:20	Ellie Davidson:	Here’s CIRC! Fwiw (admittedly something I worked on, so I’m bias!) https://hackmd.io/uJjk12ltQkO60duUYJtBEQ
00:49:21	Friederike Ernst:	Yes @Alon Muroch | SSVLabs — should be easy for EVM chains, but might be slightly trickier for non-EVM (which could also compose, because it’s all call based)
00:49:26	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Reacted to "Yes" with ❤️
00:49:42	Ellie Davidson:	But it functions the same, the execution table is essentially the mailbox in CIRC.  I actually think SCOPE is better than CIRC, though!
00:50:15	Ellie Davidson:	All of them work with real-time proving or after the fact the proving.  The proving systems is orthogonal to the protocol design, really.
00:50:37	Joshua Rudolf:	Reacted to "But it functions the..." with 🙏
00:50:37	Friederike Ernst:	We’ll check out CIRC as well @Ellie Davidson !
00:50:41	Ellie Davidson:	Reacted to "We’ll check out CIRC..." with ❤️
00:51:00	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Awesome!
00:52:24	Joshua Rudolf:	Reacted to "We’ll check out CIRC..." with ❤️
00:54:57	Ellie Davidson:	I don’t think real time proving is actually necessary. It improve the UX, but it isn’t fundamentally required if a rollup is willing to have shared settlement.
00:55:14	Ellie Davidson:	The proving is orthogonal, imo.
00:55:34	Ellie Davidson:	Real time proving removes reorgs, which is a big benefit.
00:55:49	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Reacted to "Real time proving re..." with 👍
00:55:50	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	ZkCloud can prove L1 Blocks for 0.02$ which is quite cheap
00:56:22	Ellie Davidson:	I think projects like Lighter and Lighter EVM, though, are a good example where you can get SC without realtime proving, since it is reasonable they have shared settlement.
00:56:34	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	if you are producing blocks as fast and as big as L1, you would be only paying around 50K per year for proving, which is considered very cheap
00:56:40	Ellie Davidson:	(Though I’d argue Lighter shouldn’t have full SC, but that’s another tangent :) )
00:56:58	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	Normally, cost is not the Offchain proofs, but the verification of the proof on chain
00:57:02	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	🙏

01:00:48	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	here we are talking about the L2 builder (sequencer/preconfer) and not the L1 builder. there is no dependency on L1 builder here at all
01:02:45	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Great SC progress everyone!

01:04:07	Friederike Ernst:	Reacted to "SC is making a comeb..." with 🚀
01:05:59	Ahmad Bitar | Nethermind:	To clarify another point here, there no point in this process that the sequencer/preconfer or anyone but the user have custody of the funds. this is done fully truslessly. the role of the preconfer/sequencer here is to facilitate all this in a single L1 transaction. this facilitation is not a requirement and can be done directly by the user himself.
01:07:15	Fateme Heidari:	Thanks
