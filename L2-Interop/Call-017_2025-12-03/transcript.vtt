1
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.829
Joshua Rudolf: Hello, Lou. We'll get started in a minute.

2
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:44.999
Joshua Rudolf: Alrighty, should we do it? I think we got the folks here who will be presenting the first agenda item.

3
00:17:45.450 --> 00:17:48.419
Joshua Rudolf: So let's, yeah, kick things off.

4
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:53.479
Joshua Rudolf: Alright, welcome to the L2 Interop Working Group.

5
00:17:53.740 --> 00:18:06.659
Joshua Rudolf: We have a few agenda items for today, starting off with updates on interoperable addresses, aka chain-specific addresses. This is ERC7828 and 7930.

6
00:18:06.750 --> 00:18:21.890
Joshua Rudolf: Presented by Unruggable in Wonderland. Next up, Open Intense Framework, some updates there, and a demo, presentation, overview of some work from Nethermind on OIF StarkNet. And then last up…

7
00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:27.900
Joshua Rudolf: Open discussion, many updates, comments for the…

8
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:35.820
Joshua Rudolf: work happening around the 7-day withdrawal window reductions. This is for optimistic roll-ups and the 7-day windows.

9
00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:40.470
Joshua Rudolf: Okay, cool. So that is an overview of the agenda, and I think we can kick things off.

10
00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.949
Joshua Rudolf: With agenda item number one, whoever wants to start there. Orca?

11
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:55.630
Orca 0x: Hey, yeah, thanks. Thanks so much, Josh. I'll share, some things to look at, I guess, quickly. All sharing's not turned on, if you can help, Josh.

12
00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.820
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, one second, sorry.

13
00:19:01.580 --> 00:19:02.770
Joshua Rudolf: Okay, good to go.

14
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:10.510
Orca 0x: Yeah, so as Josh mentioned, this is, This is…

15
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:16.170
Orca 0x: interoperable addresses, so this has been, ongoing for a while.

16
00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.640
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): screen just yet, okay.

17
00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.699
Orca 0x: Yeah, one second, I'm just getting the permission.

18
00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.580
Orca 0x: Can you see this guy? No?

19
00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:25.199
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Yeah, works. Thank you.

20
00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:40.200
Orca 0x: So this is a site just giving an overview of some of the work which we'll be, publishing. As Josh mentioned, this is, chain-aware addressing for the Ethereum ecosystem. It actually… the standards, allow for addressing, for non-EVM chains as well.

21
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:54.789
Orca 0x: There's been, collaborative effort between a bunch of people. Some of the logos are here. If, your organization has been a part of it and isn't, shown here, then definitely do, give us a shout. In terms of why these addresses are needed,

22
00:19:55.490 --> 00:20:14.349
Orca 0x: obviously, getting addresses and chains, joined up in the right way is important. Wrong chain lost funds in some cases, just generally readability typos, and there's also, like, a reliance on a centralized, chain list for a lot of, information in terms of chain IDs, mapping to chain names. Interoperable addresses,

23
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:28.119
Orca 0x: try to address a bunch of these in one fell swoop. So, chain-specific addresses to prevent errors, powered by an on-chain registry, a compact format for use in cross-chain messaging and intent declaration.

24
00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:45.859
Orca 0x: Thinking about things like human readability, and yeah, as I mentioned, universal compatibility. How does it work? Essentially, there are these two ERCs, two layers, there's 7930, which is the, the binary representation, a simple human reader format, and 7828 wraps that in,

25
00:20:46.140 --> 00:21:00.580
Orca 0x: ENS for both, address resolution, but then also chain name resolution, so you can put in alis.ETH at base. These specifications are, approaching finalization, so I think Thomas from Honorable will talk a little bit more about

26
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:12.999
Orca 0x: Where we're at with those, and the state of the chain registry. And yeah, we're working on essentially tooling, stuff to make this a bit more accessible and digestible, so, essentially, if you look at metallic.eth, the ETH,

27
00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:29.389
Orca 0x: This is a demo site powered by the, addresses module of the Interop SDK. It essentially breaks down and makes it easy to see, okay, when you've got… if you go from this human readable address, how then that gets turned into the binary format, what the different parts are, you can see the representation there.

28
00:21:29.390 --> 00:21:34.050
Orca 0x: And all this is available in the Wonderland, introp,

29
00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:40.339
Orca 0x: SDK, and specifically the interop addresses module. There's some FAQs there as well,

30
00:21:40.610 --> 00:21:43.629
Orca 0x: But, as I mentioned,

31
00:21:43.630 --> 00:22:00.910
Orca 0x: we've made a lot of progress, there's still a few things remaining, which I think Thomas, will talk about, and generally we're working with… we're talking to wallets about, integration. We're seeing this being integrated into more and more standards, so even, today, clear signing, the clear signing effort, I think 7730,

32
00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:07.549
Orca 0x: we were talking about this, so, excited to see it, I guess, approaching production,

33
00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:09.540
Orca 0x: And I'll hand it over to Thomas.

34
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:28.469
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: Perfect, thank you, Walker. I'm Thomas from Unruggable, we work for the ENS DAO, and we've been working extensively with the team at Wonderland on these specs, so I'm just gonna give a brief update from the ENS end and from the spec end.

35
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:35.420
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: In terms of 7930, which is the binary format, we've been iterating

36
00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:59.860
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: on the exact terminology and semantics of that specification to make it as accessible as possible. We're very close to, kind of, completion on that, and then we're going to be, creating a pull request to get that into the actual Ethereum ERC's repo. The 7828 one adds the ENS-specific functionality, which is a chain

37
00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:08.790
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: registry resolver, that is the resolver for the on.eth, second-level ENS name.

38
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:26.490
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: There was a temperature check posted by Josh on the ENS forum to get a read of the room if the ENS community were happy to assign ownership of on.eth to the multi-sig that will be leading that effort.

39
00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:40.470
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: I've posted that link in the chat. The general consensus from the ENS DAO was a positive one. I say the general consensus, it was completely positive, no one disagreed, everyone was very happy with it.

40
00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:51.199
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: So, in terms of next steps, I will be putting together the call data to, propose an executable proposal to the ENS DAO to have that assigned.

41
00:23:51.200 --> 00:24:09.699
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: to a multisig, which will then allow us to set the chain resolver as the resolver for that ENS name, which is the resolver through which all of this, chain metadata discovery

42
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.670
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: occurs.

43
00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:14.939
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: In terms of the state of that chain resolver.

44
00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:34.749
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: that repo is complete and ready to go. We had a discussion today between myself and the Wonderland team. We're just working to add some final touches, including aliases, whereby chains go by multiple identifiers in different contexts.

45
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:49.479
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: The obvious ones being OP and Optimism, or ARB and ARB1, such that we kind of have the functionality that those can all resolve to the same ERC7930 identifier.

46
00:24:49.770 --> 00:25:00.670
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: Orca is piecing together, kind of, a finalized list of chains, their labels, and the metadata associated

47
00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:19.689
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: with those chains, the intention was that we would post that on the ENS forum, as well as on ETH Magicians, and we would circulate that through social media to kind of get the eyes of chain operators on that list to make sure that everything is correct and in order.

48
00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:34.200
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: Initially, we're intending to have the administration of the resolver controlled by a multisig that will have representatives of Wonderland, Unruggable, the Ethereum Foundation, the ENSDAO, etc.

49
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:52.250
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: And then, over time, once this is kind of solidified and everyone's happy with the state of things, we will assign authoritative ownership to the people and representatives of the chains in question, and, we will kind of…

50
00:25:52.250 --> 00:26:06.420
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: remove any administrative control from that multisig. So at that point, the chain will own all of their metadata and all of the information associated with it.

51
00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:12.659
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: I think that that is, everything.

52
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:25.349
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: Yeah, once the executable proposal is passed, we're just doing final testing of these contracts, we'll kind of test it in production on the on.eth

53
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:43.150
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: name, and make sure everything is working. Then the intention is to create pull requests to established frameworks like VM and EFAS, such that we can get this integrated into clients, wallets, dApps, etc.

54
00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:57.229
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: That is all from my end, happy to answer any questions.

55
00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:07.239
Christian Montoya: Hi, this is a great update. There's just a couple questions in the chat for links to the SDK and the website for interoperable addresses.

56
00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.360
Christian Montoya: Thank you.

57
00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:15.159
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, Orca, do you want to drop a link? I think the website is not quite ready to be live yet, is that correct?

58
00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:22.590
Orca 0x: Yep, that's right. We'll, we'll definitely share it, I guess, with this group when it's…

59
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:25.090
Orca 0x: But I shared the link to the NPM.

60
00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.270
Orca 0x: Package.

61
00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:28.510
Joshua Rudolf: Perfect.

62
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.070
Joshua Rudolf: Any other questions?

63
00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:42.609
Joshua Rudolf: Cool. We can move on then. Next up on the agenda, OIF updates.

64
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.540
Joshua Rudolf: Maybe we can start off…

65
00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.499
Joshua Rudolf: Let's see, is Barnabe here? Are you available to chat, to talk?

66
00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:50.230
Barnabé Monnot: Hey.

67
00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.790
Joshua Rudolf: Yep, can you hear me?

68
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.660
Joshua Rudolf: We can.

69
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:54.530
Barnabé Monnot: Nice.

70
00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.839
Barnabé Monnot: And… And show…

71
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:06.030
Barnabé Monnot: some slides just quickly, and then I let, I know there's other people in the room who were also part of this, so…

72
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:16.800
Barnabé Monnot: like, briefly, what happened, just before DevConnect is we… a bunch of us went to HCT, from Ethereum Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Wonderland.

73
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:21.860
Barnabé Monnot: and many, many other teams, LeFi and other teams that are…

74
00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:25.319
Barnabé Monnot: now dipping their toes into the Open Intents Framework.

75
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:31.280
Barnabé Monnot: The idea of this week that we spent together in Patagonia was to try to accelerate

76
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:48.400
Barnabé Monnot: some of the integrations or components of OIF towards having an end-to-end demo of an intent that was secure and propagated through the OIF layers.

77
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.940
Barnabé Monnot: End.

78
00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:59.070
Barnabé Monnot: I think we made, actually, a lot of progress. Maybe some people will discuss some of those, but I just want to show an overview of what was built.

79
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:07.480
Barnabé Monnot: One of the first things was a payment request demo that was actually using the interoperable addresses.

80
00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:12.759
Barnabé Monnot: And OIF at the back to, to settle the intent.

81
00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:29.649
Barnabé Monnot: Ms. Love from Bike Economy and Kaimi, they worked on, cross-chain deposits using composable batching, so that apps have access to a toolbox that allows them to just very easily provide interoperability tools to their users.

82
00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:46.740
Barnabé Monnot: We had some work on a compliant resolver, so using 7683, make the solver understand the orders so that, yeah, you can create deeper markets with more solvers that all follow the same standard.

83
00:29:47.110 --> 00:29:57.319
Barnabé Monnot: We wanted to harden also the oracles, so propose, like, an optimistic game that secures an intent, so the solver wants to settle.

84
00:29:57.730 --> 00:30:06.010
Barnabé Monnot: Somebody can challenge that settlement, and this is eventually reserved using the broadcaster, which is this trust-minimized proof

85
00:30:06.210 --> 00:30:09.000
Barnabé Monnot: Going over the canonical bridges.

86
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:16.150
Barnabé Monnot: someone worked on, proving the fields, so instead of storage proof, using, ZK proofs, which I think was really cool.

87
00:30:16.330 --> 00:30:21.700
Barnabé Monnot: And then we had another project that was mixing, together AI agents,

88
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:31.330
Barnabé Monnot: resource logs, TEs, and other, like, tools in one beautiful, mix of all of this.

89
00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:39.449
Barnabé Monnot: Yeah, I think that that's it, but we had a lot of fun, and I think it was also very productive to show the…

90
00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:51.000
Barnabé Monnot: like, the promise of OAF and already what's available, which was quite a lot, like, definitely sufficient for us to make a lot of progress in 3 days.

91
00:30:55.090 --> 00:30:56.150
Joshua Rudolf: Awesome, thanks.

92
00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:59.069
Joshua Rudolf: Pepe, do you want to share anything next?

93
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:11.919
Pepe Blasco: Yeah, sure. So, I just want to reiterate what Barnabe just said, like, we had a very nice time in Patagonia. I appreciate everyone who attended and everyone who supported.

94
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:26.769
Pepe Blasco: since then, or, like, around those days, a couple of updates regarding IF and often settling. So, the main outlet of the IF Settlement Contracts was released. You can find it on the IF Contracts repo.

95
00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:41.659
Pepe Blasco: We've also audited the first part of the broadcaster protocol, so, like, the core contracts in Broadcaster have been audited. I believe that audit is not still fully public, but will be shared relatively soon.

96
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:45.610
Pepe Blasco: An upcoming audit will take care of

97
00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:49.230
Pepe Blasco: All the provers for each different network type.

98
00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:53.100
Pepe Blasco: One of the points that was raised, or was…

99
00:31:53.230 --> 00:32:03.959
Pepe Blasco: identified during the Patagonia event, it was, like, the fact that the solver could not support arbitrary callbacks, and could not, kind of, support

100
00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:20.609
Pepe Blasco: basically random actions on top of just moving tokens. There is already basically a solution for that in the solver repo, so if anyone is interested in following up, you can go and take a look.

101
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:31.719
Pepe Blasco: Now, what's happening? Like, what are we now focusing on? We are focusing on a broadcaster and evolving the provers and making sure we have

102
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:50.560
Pepe Blasco: like, secure and compatible provers for everything, and we are focusing on onboarding the long tail of edges. So, we will be able to share much more information on how we are feeling about it, but generally speaking, we've identified the biggest

103
00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:59.330
Pepe Blasco: requirement is basically having a solver or a solver network that supports your specific new L2, and…

104
00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:02.840
Pepe Blasco: The solver will basically be able to do self…

105
00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:17.560
Pepe Blasco: onboarding, but a lot of networks doesn't want to run that infrastructure themselves. So, we are looking at ways on how to facilitate this, on how to play around with liquidity management, so…

106
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:32.849
Pepe Blasco: Yeah, it's… it's an active point of conversation, so if any of you are interested in participating in these debates, if you know of an L2 that wants to get onboarded and is having issues with other intent providers.

107
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:41.420
Pepe Blasco: happy to… to get in that. And then for the big question of what's being printed, it's, deer, like,

108
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.360
Pepe Blasco: Wine bottle holder beer.

109
00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:48.759
Pepe Blasco: I will send you a picture, Horace.

110
00:33:49.750 --> 00:34:01.640
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Nice, please do. I actually also have one remark that is OIF-related, not just the printer behind Pepper, and that is, a few days ago, on the OIF driver's call.

111
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:11.909
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): To some people's surprise, we kinda identified a potential obstacle for OYF, which is that the, even

112
00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:22.950
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): I would have thought negligible gas cost increase of something like an OIF wrapper of 10K might actually be a big showstop.

113
00:34:22.989 --> 00:34:39.759
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): for some solvers and even aggregators. And so I was wondering if anyone in this call had additional input on what it would take for a standard that is slightly less gas efficient to actually be more attractive to them.

114
00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:55.260
Pepe Blasco: I mean, my thoughts, just to share with the rest, is obviously, much more, kind of.

115
00:34:55.420 --> 00:35:02.820
Pepe Blasco: Streamlined contrast will allow for optimized gas use utility, having a standardized

116
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:20.449
Pepe Blasco: wrapper or layer on top of that may increase the gas cost, but will definitely increase the compatibility surface. So, I think it's also worth checking, like, if anyone on this call or checking the recording does have specific concerns.

117
00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:28.059
Pepe Blasco: worth mentioning, we've been talking with LeFi and across teams for this, and they also have their own

118
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:31.119
Pepe Blasco: Thoughts on different approaches for this?

119
00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.759
Joshua Rudolf: Cool. I think we have a few more updates on OIF. Mislav, do you want to hop in next?

120
00:35:48.500 --> 00:36:06.230
Mislav Javor: Yeah, sure. Hi, everyone. Mislav here from Biconomy. Yeah, I actually wanted to share some slides as well, but I joined over the web, web Zoom, so it's not allowing me. Anyways, what we were working on, I give a shout out to,

121
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:21.520
Mislav Javor: Vaults, FYI, and Kaimi, who is Anon, so we'll stop there. So the idea was that, we combined the OIF7683 with 4337,

122
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:34.270
Mislav Javor: with 7579, and with a few non-ERC things, which is Biconomy supertransactions and Vault's FYI call data generation, to achieve something that's kind of a…

123
00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:41.580
Mislav Javor: big deal in DeFi is rebalancing volts from one chain to another without any dust

124
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:55.510
Mislav Javor: in between. So, like, the problem that you had, the problem space that you had before was if you, like, go from a USDC vault to a USDT vault, from, like, Arbitrum to base, the problem is that

125
00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:09.370
Mislav Javor: when you unwind, maybe at that point you still have information exactly how much you're gonna get from the vault. Sometimes you don't, because, like, linear calculations, like, for curves, for calculating interest rates, can mess up with you.

126
00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:28.800
Mislav Javor: But if you, like, withdraw from a vault, then you swap to another token, then you call a bridge, then you, you know, supply… approve and supply to another… a vault on another chain, the idea is that this should all be done in a single signature. Now, this uses… for the single signature stuff, we use the Biconomy MerkleTree ERC7579.

127
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:43.349
Mislav Javor: validator module, which enables, basically, single-click execution across multiple chains. It's very, very similar in design to the MerkleTree validator from EIL, Ethereum Interoperability Layer. Essentially, I think it's…

128
00:37:43.350 --> 00:38:01.040
Mislav Javor: it's part of our codebase that's being referenced there as well. So that's… I'm assuming that's also something that's gonna get standardized quite soon. And then we used this composable batching module, and then we used basically one of the features that I'm the happiest that OIF currently has.

129
00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:05.810
Mislav Javor: Which is the fact that with OIF, You don't have to…

130
00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:21.569
Mislav Javor: provide the exact same value to the function call that you quoted. For example, you quote, an Ethereum, like, you quote moving USDC from one chain to WETH on another chain.

131
00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:32.609
Mislav Javor: And then you get, basically, a quote that says, like, for $3,100 USDC, I'll give you 1W ETH, or something like that. If you are essentially

132
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:39.090
Mislav Javor: In a lot of, like, other bridges, you would have to provide the exact same value that you quoted before.

133
00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:54.069
Mislav Javor: But this… you quoted this before you started execution, so before slippages were incurred on-chain, you didn't know exactly where in the block your transaction is gonna get set. Maybe you get, like, some better, some worse execution. So you could get very, very precise. You could get within, like.

134
00:38:54.190 --> 00:39:05.199
Mislav Javor: half a percent of precision, but you would always leave some dust. And this would incur, compounding execution inefficiencies. If you had

135
00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:18.909
Mislav Javor: 0.3% in efficiency on every step. You would have 5 steps, it would escalate to 1.5%, and suddenly your solver or multi-chain execution aggregator is no longer competitive with anything on the market.

136
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:32.449
Mislav Javor: This has made it so that right now, how these multi-chain, vault optimizations are done is that solvers actually hold inventory of vault tokens, often, and they will quote you for this.

137
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:36.439
Mislav Javor: Oftentimes, for smaller vaults, this will result in, like.

138
00:39:36.810 --> 00:39:47.079
Mislav Javor: immense slippages, like 60%, 70%, something like that. So, in this case, the only slippage we incur is the, like, USDC to WETH.

139
00:39:47.170 --> 00:40:03.770
Mislav Javor: open intense framework slippage, which, you know, with the modular nature and the capital that's gonna accrue there with all the big solvers, I assume that's gonna be an extremely competitive rate. And all the withdrawal from Vault, swaps, and then supply to another vault.

140
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:08.690
Mislav Javor: is done through this composable batching, so it's essentially a zero-slippage operation, so…

141
00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:17.280
Mislav Javor: Yeah, that's been, coded in the 3 days, that we were there. We did a live demo, it worked really nicely. I mean, it's…

142
00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:33.599
Mislav Javor: demo is kind of janky, to be honest. It was lucky that it worked, but it demonstrated the point across. And yeah, so the idea here is also, if anyone is interested, I would like to propose… we already have the code audited, ready to go, but

143
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:50.840
Mislav Javor: for people to comment and maybe make composable batching into an ERC, I would love to see it being an essential part of the Ethereum stack, to be honest. It's shown itself to be immensely useful for us and our clients when used. Yeah, that's it from my end.

144
00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:55.430
Joshua Rudolf: Thanks, Gustav.

145
00:40:56.490 --> 00:40:59.490
Joshua Rudolf: Anyone else with any updates on OIS stuff?

146
00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:13.099
Joshua Rudolf: Cool. If not, John, I think you're up next then.

147
00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:29.680
John Church: Okay, hey everybody, it's John Church, NetherMind, product lead for, our, for our institutional and DeFi, and also our, our StarkNet division. But I just wanted to showcase, you know, we…

148
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:36.990
John Church: we were really excited about building an extension of the OIF on StarkNet, and so, we've…

149
00:41:37.930 --> 00:41:39.759
John Church: I'll share my screen…

150
00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:59.400
John Church: We've built this out, a Cairo implementation of the Solidity contracts, as well as a solver in Go, instead of the Open Intense Rust solver. So, you know, if anybody's interested in checking this out, I'm gonna share this in the chat, and…

151
00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:04.010
John Church: You know, we have, we have the tests spilled out, we have,

152
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:21.860
John Church: you know, everything flushed out for anybody to get started, and of course, a template solver, so, you know, anybody would want to take this and customize it to different strategies, or whatever your competitive analysis is. So…

153
00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:34.759
John Church: And we also liked it so much that our, our, lead dev on it decided, took it and built a, a hackathon project with it, and implemented it. So, Matt, if you wanna…

154
00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.119
John Church: Share off what you built.

155
00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:47.839
Matt | Nethermind: Sure, yeah, hey everybody, my name's Matt, also from Netherlands, yep. I can share my screen here. I'm new to Zoom, so excuse, let's see…

156
00:42:50.770 --> 00:42:52.860
Matt | Nethermind: Set permissions real quick.

157
00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:02.820
Matt | Nethermind: In order to scrub the quit and reopen, is that fine, or would… should we just skip this?

158
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:07.899
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Maybe try. Usually you don't need to actually restart, just try.

159
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.810
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): No, that you've granted.

160
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:10.680
Matt | Nethermind: Gotcha.

161
00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.420
Matt | Nethermind: Oh, yeah, I think you're right.

162
00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:16.920
Matt | Nethermind: Cool, so you guys can see my screen now?

163
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.089
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Yep, we can.

164
00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:38.720
Matt | Nethermind: So yeah, here is the project we built for the hackathon. The only difference between this and the one that we built for Nethermind is that we added support for the new network, like a proof-of-concept network called ZarkNet. Darknet? It's kind of hard to pronounce. But essentially, this all runs off of that, so I've already connected an EVM wallet and a Starknet wallet, so…

165
00:43:39.250 --> 00:43:48.490
Matt | Nethermind: Here, I'll open up this, and then if we open up… we're also running a solver for the hackathon, so if I pull that up, now we can see the logs for that.

166
00:43:48.810 --> 00:43:51.890
Matt | Nethermind: Okay.

167
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.499
Matt | Nethermind: Cool, so if we pick a chain…

168
00:43:55.570 --> 00:44:02.359
Matt | Nethermind: We can just show off, go to StarkNet, keep it simple. For this demo, we're using just an ERC20 that we deployed

169
00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.110
Matt | Nethermind: Sorry.

170
00:44:15.530 --> 00:44:18.770
Matt | Nethermind: Transaction, bridging those tokens.

171
00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:23.710
Matt | Nethermind: And then we'll see over here, we'll see the solver pick up the order.

172
00:44:26.070 --> 00:44:28.200
Matt | Nethermind: And start to fill it.

173
00:44:34.690 --> 00:44:40.829
Matt | Nethermind: And with that, I mean, I can share transaction hashes, but with that, you will see that the $1 coin is now…

174
00:44:41.170 --> 00:44:43.490
Matt | Nethermind: sent to the StarkNet address.

175
00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:44.950
John Church: So…

176
00:44:45.630 --> 00:44:54.929
John Church: So that's it. We just wanted to celebrate a win, share off how we built an implementation and the like, so, you know, it's,

177
00:44:55.370 --> 00:45:05.370
John Church: you know, no major protocol updates or anything like that, but we're extending OIF to StarkNet, and yeah, the UI was pretty cool. I thought they did a good job at that.

178
00:45:08.610 --> 00:45:09.560
John Church: Thanks, Matt.

179
00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:11.100
Matt | Nethermind: No problem.

180
00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:15.800
Matt | Nethermind: How do I stop shit? Or is it already? Oh, right here. Oh, cool.

181
00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.179
Joshua Rudolf: Super cool. Thanks, John and Matt.

182
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:19.719
John Church: Yeah. Thanks, guys.

183
00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:27.999
Joshua Rudolf: I think it's great to see progress is progress, and it's great to see continued adoption of shared infrastructure. So, yeah, thanks for coming on and…

184
00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:29.090
Joshua Rudolf: sharing that.

185
00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.940
Joshua Rudolf: Any questions on any of that?

186
00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.270
Joshua Rudolf: Hmm.

187
00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:46.600
Joshua Rudolf: If not, we can move on. I think we are at the final agenda item for today, which is…

188
00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:55.960
Joshua Rudolf: discussion on… a continued discussion of what we touched on on the last call, which is the 7-day window reduction.

189
00:45:56.110 --> 00:46:03.990
Joshua Rudolf: And maybe just to set a bit of context for folks who are not familiar, I think most everyone here is, but just in case…

190
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:08.330
Joshua Rudolf: What is this? Why do we have 7-day windows? Just really quickly, well…

191
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:24.679
Joshua Rudolf: And actually, Dono has a great post on this, I'll link it in the chat in a second, recommend reading for anyone interested. TLDR was originally set to allow enough time for a social response in case of any sort of attack from, let's say, malicious nodes or builders, and to prevent

192
00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:39.100
Joshua Rudolf: funds from being stolen. Downside, of course, of the 7-day window is that it's a bottleneck on UX, liquidity, assets, and just generally users' ability to seamlessly do what they want to do across chains.

193
00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:52.939
Joshua Rudolf: So there's been a bunch of discussion and renewed interest. This is not the first time this has come up, of course. It's not a sort of new piece of information. This was by design, with an understanding of some of the sort of limitations.

194
00:46:53.420 --> 00:47:11.010
Joshua Rudolf: And I think there's been a bit of, or there's definitely been a bit of renewed interest in seeing what we can do, given what we've learned, and given what we now know around, paths to reducing this to something like 1 or 2 days. I think there's fairly broad agreement that there are significant benefits. There's no…

195
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:14.450
Joshua Rudolf: Disagreement that the benefits are meaningful.

196
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:28.810
Joshua Rudolf: But at the same time, this is, of course, a sensitive area. We want to be mindful in how we approach this, and not just sort of YOLO it. So, yes, we've had discussions with folks from Arbitrum, Optimism, Uniswap.

197
00:47:28.810 --> 00:47:40.240
Joshua Rudolf: L2Beat around what is the right way to do this, what sort of data do we need to gather, and how can we do this in a way that, of course, doesn't take months and months, but allows us to get

198
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:43.100
Joshua Rudolf: Sufficient confidence in what we're doing here.

199
00:47:43.290 --> 00:47:49.859
Joshua Rudolf: So maybe that's just, yeah, a bit of context. I see we have Ed here, do you want to jump in with anything?

200
00:47:52.080 --> 00:48:08.330
Ed Felten: Sure, yeah. So, from my point of view, and I think our team's point of view, what we would need to justify reducing the inclusion time assumption would be some kind of analysis

201
00:48:08.330 --> 00:48:25.779
Ed Felten: that shows that doing so would be safe. That is, against an adversary who is very highly motivated and capable. Can we really guarantee that a party who wants to get a transaction included on L1 Ethereum can do so within 24 hours?

202
00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:32.939
Ed Felten: And in order to establish that, we need to think about, sort of, what assumptions can we make about a theory?

203
00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:38.429
Ed Felten: Because I think it's easy to get to a one-day delay if you make unrealistic assumptions.

204
00:48:38.550 --> 00:48:53.899
Ed Felten: Right? Like, an unrealistic assumption would be to assume that if I want to submit a transaction at time zero, that at time zero, it will be in the mempool of every… local mempool of every builder, and will stay there.

205
00:48:53.900 --> 00:49:11.990
Ed Felten: Even if a highly motivated and capable adversary is trying to prevent that, right? That would not be a realistic assumption to make, because we know that adversaries can, in fact, mess with mempool propagation, try to destabilize the P2P network, and so on. So in order to… anyway, in order to get to,

206
00:49:12.210 --> 00:49:29.560
Ed Felten: in order to get to any confidence in an assumption about inclusion time, which I think is what this really is about, really requires, like, careful analysis of all the different ways that an attacker could try to prevent inclusion of transactions. And I don't think we have anything like

207
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:43.470
Ed Felten: that kind of analysis that's been done, to my knowledge, by anybody at this point. And that's really… I think that's really the missing piece, that would be needed to justify making a particular change.

208
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:54.650
Joshua Rudolf: Right, and just to highlight for the group, what we need to understand is what is the maximum cost to guarantee a single transaction can get in within a certain amount of time, in this case, 24 hours?

209
00:49:56.290 --> 00:49:59.700
Ed Felten: Well, the question is, can we even guarantee that at any cost?

210
00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:02.020
Joshua Rudolf: Because that… even that is not established.

211
00:50:02.770 --> 00:50:03.320
Joshua Rudolf: Right.

212
00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:10.810
Ed Felten: Right, there are some… just to expand a little bit on what Josh said, there…

213
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:28.300
Ed Felten: there are some kinds of attacks that are economic in nature, and there may be economic responses to those attacks, where honest parties could spend some money to try to sort of somehow outbid an adversary who's, let's say, bribing block builders. But there are other attacks that are not economic in nature.

214
00:50:28.310 --> 00:50:37.549
Ed Felten: And, you know, this being a security property, we need to reason from a set of assumptions about what Ethereum

215
00:50:37.550 --> 00:50:53.739
Ed Felten: what guarantees Ethereum can provide us, and then figure out, okay, given those assumptions about what Ethereum can provide, here's a procedure that we can embed in our code that would guarantee inclusion within 24 hours, or 48, or whatever number

216
00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:57.659
Ed Felten: Whatever number, we might pick.

217
00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.470
Joshua Rudolf: Right.

218
00:50:59.470 --> 00:51:10.630
Ed Felten: And that's kind of, to me, that's the missing piece, is, you know, what are the assumptions about L1, and then what procedure from those assumptions can get us to a guarantee of inclusion?

219
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.810
Joshua Rudolf: So I shared in the chat some…

220
00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:22.480
Joshua Rudolf: Not a full answer to this question, but,

221
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:33.590
Joshua Rudolf: some analysis that Dono from L2Beat has put together. I think, Ed, you've pointed out that this doesn't quite fully cover some of the more, sort of, adversarial… Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:43.720
Ed Felten: Yeah, this, this, as I understand it, Dono's formula is based on a paper that our team published, that analyzes one type of economic attack.

223
00:51:43.940 --> 00:51:53.959
Ed Felten: But, it's only one of the tactics that an adversary could use, and combining that tactic with other tactics,

224
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:57.390
Ed Felten: would,

225
00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:03.400
Ed Felten: means that the results of the paper don't give you any guarantee that would apply to Ethereum.

226
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:17.030
Ed Felten: Right. It's… so it's… it's maybe a piece of the analysis that might be needed, but, it doesn't, it doesn't cover, some of the really significant, potential avenues of attack.

227
00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:19.500
Joshua Rudolf: Right.

228
00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:30.939
Joshua Rudolf: And if anyone else wants to jump into the discussion, feel free. Ed, how is your team sort of approaching next steps here, then, potentially? Are we… are there folks on your side that are looking at

229
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.979
Joshua Rudolf: A more thorough analysis?

230
00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:47.060
Ed Felten: The really tough part is, there's a bunch of tough pieces of this. One of them is how to analyze the possibility of old-school denial-of-service attacks, like, say, network flooding attacks against the

231
00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:55.970
Ed Felten: Against the party who's trying to get a transaction included. What kind of assumptions can we safely make about ordinary parties' ability to

232
00:52:55.970 --> 00:53:14.409
Ed Felten: let's say, reestablish connectivity to Ethereum if they're subject to such an attack from a highly motivated adversary. That's one piece that I think is hard to model. Another piece that I think is hard to model is P2P propagation and mempool management in clients, because

233
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:22.700
Ed Felten: Clients tend to use client-specific heuristics to decide how to manage their mempool, what to keep, what to throw out when it gets full, and so on.

234
00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:30.029
Ed Felten: And so, if we're going to make an assumption that an honest party can keep their transaction in the mempool of

235
00:53:30.110 --> 00:53:40.539
Ed Felten: all of the block builders, for an extended period of time against a hostile adversary trying to prevent that. Then we need to have some way of reasoning about, say, mempool maintenance

236
00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:56.049
Ed Felten: policies of clients and how resistant they are to manipulative behavior by other clients. So, we don't really even have a handhold on that problem, I think.

237
00:53:58.410 --> 00:53:59.559
Joshua Rudolf: Right, got it.

238
00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:16.390
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, I guess I'm trying to think through, then, what is the, sort of, best path forward at this point? It might be taking it back to the group.

239
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:29.880
Joshua Rudolf: I know, yeah, Optimism is also interested in running their own analysis on this, as well as Uniswap and potentially others. Pepe, you mentioned potentially OpenZeppelin might want to jump in and help if…

240
00:54:30.030 --> 00:54:31.110
Joshua Rudolf: If helpful.

241
00:54:32.850 --> 00:54:47.290
Ed Felten: Yeah, I mean, if people… if people have, analyses about, say, the impact, or what we can assume about, let's call them old-school denial-of-service attacks, or what we can,

242
00:54:48.050 --> 00:55:00.150
Ed Felten: what we can assume about attacks on P2P propagation or mempool management, that would be really helpful. I think those are missing pieces, and if anybody can figure out, like.

243
00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:11.070
Ed Felten: how to reason about the security of properties of that against an active, motivated adversary. I think that would help to fill in the… fill in the gaps.

244
00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.420
Joshua Rudolf: Okay, cool, that's helpful, got it.

245
00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.489
Joshua Rudolf: And Ed, I'm not sure if you're the right person, from your side to answer this question, but…

246
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:28.490
Joshua Rudolf: Maybe helpful to share, sort of, the latest on how your team is thinking about the alternative, or another approach around

247
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:35.540
Joshua Rudolf: accelerating something like a 2 of 3 system? I think Metallica called it Pragmatic Fast Finality in the past.

248
00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:40.300
Ed Felten: Right, so, yeah, there's things you can do if you,

249
00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:49.989
Ed Felten: where you have, like, a ZK proving and optimistic proving, as well as some kind of, say, Security Council,

250
00:55:50.060 --> 00:56:05.049
Ed Felten: veto, type of situation, and where you want 2 or 3 of those to happen. Now one thing to note is that Security Council affirmative secure… or, let's see, so a Security Council response

251
00:56:05.340 --> 00:56:25.040
Ed Felten: also relies on non-censorship, or an assumption about the Security Council's ability to include a transaction. The other thing to note is that ZK-based proving is also subject to censorship attacks. The difference is that censorship of posting a ZK proof

252
00:56:25.090 --> 00:56:34.230
Ed Felten: Doesn't allow an… doesn't, harm the safety of the chain, but it does, prevent… it does delay settlement.

253
00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:50.249
Ed Felten: And there are realistic scenarios where a motivated adversary can delay the posting, temporarily censor the posting of ZK proof in order to delay, settlement and cross-chain interop for whatever reasons they might have.

254
00:56:50.250 --> 00:56:57.769
Ed Felten: And that's another area that I think is under-analyzed, is, basically,

255
00:56:58.610 --> 00:57:05.349
Ed Felten: attacks that aim to delay settlement, as opposed to defeat it.

256
00:57:11.340 --> 00:57:12.370
Joshua Rudolf: Right, got it.

257
00:57:12.570 --> 00:57:19.630
Ed Felten: Right, so I think even with the 2 out of 3 system, you're still subject to some censorship considerations.

258
00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:37.339
Ed Felten: As well as the obvious ones around cost, the cost of posting frequently, and so on. But yeah, we're absolutely working. We, the off-chain team in R&D, are working toward a system that would be in the spirit of that tier of three.

259
00:57:38.610 --> 00:57:46.840
Joshua Rudolf: And not to, like, hold you to any sort of specific data, of course, but how are you thinking about, sort of, the roadmap here, and is this, like, a 2026 goal, further out?

260
00:57:47.340 --> 00:57:49.199
Ed Felten: We're not talking about dates.

261
00:57:49.410 --> 00:57:55.439
Ed Felten: And I'm being a little cautious here, because I'm not sure what we said publicly.

262
00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:55.940
Joshua Rudolf: Sure, sure.

263
00:57:55.940 --> 00:58:14.699
Ed Felten: But, it's been… it's been a tough… maybe one of my teammates on the calls, on the call, knows this more clearly, what's been announced and what's not been announced, and if so, please do speak up. But it's an effort that's been underway for a considerable length of time.

264
00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:26.129
Ed Felten: And I gave a talk, a public talk about a year ago about, a scheme for, this sort of, two, two of three, or, style of, of proving.

265
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:32.229
Ed Felten: So it's something we've been working on for a long time, as well as the underlying, sort of, ZK proving piece.

266
00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:37.250
Allan | Offchain Labs: Yeah, no public timeloads have been communicated on this yet.

267
00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:39.630
Ed Felten: Thanks, Alan.

268
00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.170
Joshua Rudolf: Got it. Thanks, Ellen.

269
00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:59.029
Joshua Rudolf: All right, well, yeah, I'm not sure that there's much else to say on the topic at the moment. If there's anyone else here, I think some of the other folks that are more active in this discussion were not able to make today's call. I appreciate Ed, thank you for making the time to come on today's call.

270
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:09.889
Joshua Rudolf: if anyone has anything to share here, we can keep going. Otherwise, maybe we can wrap the call up here, and I'm sure this won't be the end of the 7-day discussion, so…

271
00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:15.000
Joshua Rudolf: can continue it async, and we'll have more to share on that, I'm sure, in the coming weeks.

272
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:35.999
Allan | Offchain Labs: Yeah, I'll just add quickly, Josh, I'm happy to work with you on trying to pull in the right people from other teams to try and check some of those boxes that I listed. There's a few that we're working on internally, there's others that I think we need a little bit more support and expertise on, if we want to try and,

273
00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:48.330
Allan | Offchain Labs: you know, make those assumptions clear, and then, you know, raise any sort of disputes we need to about those assumptions, and get to a point where we could feel comfortable, changing that period. So,

274
00:59:48.330 --> 00:59:56.560
Allan | Offchain Labs: just let me or let me know if there's anything we can do to help, herd cats outside of, this group, or just OCL broadly.

275
00:59:57.890 --> 01:00:11.369
Joshua Rudolf: That's great, yeah, I will definitely hit you up about that. Yeah, I think right now we're in a bit of a position where we're all sort of, like, standing around, pointing at each other a little bit, everyone's busy, and no one is, like, really has the bandwidth, I think, to jump in and…

276
01:00:11.370 --> 01:00:19.410
Joshua Rudolf: spend the necessary time to do the proper analysis here, but I think with maybe a bit of thoughtful herding, we can get it done in the coming weeks.

277
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:22.190
Joshua Rudolf: Or at least make some progress in this direction.

278
01:00:23.450 --> 01:00:31.310
Joshua Rudolf: So yes, and if anyone else has interest, comments, anything around this, feel free to message me or anyone else here, drop a message in the chat.

279
01:00:37.410 --> 01:00:38.180
Joshua Rudolf: Cool.

280
01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:43.400
Joshua Rudolf: Okay, awesome. Thank you all so much for joining. See you all next time.

281
01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:45.430
Mislav Javor: Thank you, bye.

282
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:46.819
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Thank you, bye guys.

283
01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.450
noahpravecek: Thanks.
