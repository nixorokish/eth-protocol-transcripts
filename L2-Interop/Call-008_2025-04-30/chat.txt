Like is it a real old?
00:19:22	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "why use # over - o..."

the use of # does not impact the standard, it's just semantics.
we chose # as an example, since we are optimizing for reducing name-bikeshedding as much as possible :)

00:19:43	cyp:	2 characters top level domain? this is not ENS compliant

is it made up for presentation or is there a resolver for the .short tld
00:20:35	Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS:	Replying to "2 characters top lev..."

A proposal could be made to the ENS DAO..
00:20:42	frangio:	Replying to "is .short an actual ‚Ä¶"
where is the shortlist defined/managed/governed?

00:21:10	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "is .short an actua..."

it is yeah :) there are more details on it on the forum posts and referenced ERCs/docs

We are working on an ENSIP proposal, we will be sharing more details soon on the TG group

00:25:56	Zodomo | Omni Network:	Is 7930 an improvement over 7828 or are they intended to coexist?
00:26:16	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "Is 7930 an improve..."

definetly coexists!
00:26:35	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "Is 7930 an improve..."

7828 leverages 7930
00:29:23	TiTi (Wonderland):	The wallet would resolve this, it's mainly on the human readable address to guarantee integrity
00:29:30	cyp @ status.network:	Reacted to "The wallet would res..." with üëç
00:29:31	TiTi (Wonderland):	In the case of a typo the wallet can warn the user

00:29:40	Zodomo | Omni Network:	Reacted to "7828 leverages 7930" with üëç
00:29:53	TiTi (Wonderland):	Or even if the user is manually changing something from the interop address, the checksum would warn an issue
00:30:03	cyp @ status.network:	so it‚Äôs more for reading than writing
00:30:17	Vandan | MetaMask:	We‚Äôll review these updates. Can you tell us how the latest version of the proposals relate to CAIP-10 format? Are they expected to be compatible?
00:30:54	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "We‚Äôll review thes..."

At the bottom of this doc we have a FAQ regarding CAIP 10 https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/RFC-Universal-Address-Formats-for-Interoperability-ERC-7828-ERC-7930-1e09a4c092c78084b56ed8a3b20aa098

Ty!

00:32:15	cyp @ status.network:	Replying to "We‚Äôll review these u..."

iirc being compatible with CAIP10 was an initial requirement?
00:32:24	Joshua Rudolf:	Also this Notion page is great, if you‚Äôre looking for a single document to read and share for folks to get up to speed:

https://defi-wonderland.notion.site/RFC-Universal-Address-Formats-for-Interoperability-ERC-7828-ERC-7930-1e09a4c092c78084b56ed8a3b20aa098

00:33:28	Vandan | MetaMask:	Replying to "We‚Äôll review these u..."

It may not be listed as a requirement but will be important for multi chain wallets.
00:34:08	TiTi (Wonderland):	Replying to "We‚Äôll review thes..."

not really a requirement but we leveraged CAIP-10 (& 2)
00:34:39	frangio:	we can't hear
00:35:02	Vandan | MetaMask:	The FAQ just explains why CAIP-10 doesn‚Äôt meet the requirements in the EIP, but doesn‚Äôt cover compatibility.
We‚Äôll review to see if we can figure that out though.
00:35:42	cyp @ status.network:	Replying to "We‚Äôll review these u..."

yes vitalik in one of the first calls was mentioning that it should be chain agnostic enough so that all other altL1s could connect to it
00:38:29	TiTi (Wonderland):	We will get back to you on any unanswered questions, please post them on the forum shared so we can properly address it
00:40:09	Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS:	Its reserved as the 3 character representation of Ethiopia.
00:40:10	frangio:	has there been discussion about using actual DNS domains to identify a chain?

frangio.eth@arbitrum.org
00:41:02	Zodomo | Omni Network:	Replying to "Its reserved as the ..."

This is not the case: https://data.iana.org/TLD/tlds-alpha-by-domain.txt
00:41:20	Zodomo | Omni Network:	Replying to "Its reserved as the ..."

ETH is not one of their TLDs
00:41:37	frangio:	re: email collisions, is this something that would have to be decided in the next 2 weeks?
00:42:08	Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS:	Replying to "Its reserved as the ..."

@Zodomo | Omni Network All the 3 character representations of country codes are reserved but not assigned.
00:42:48	Zodomo | Omni Network:	Replying to "Its reserved as the ..."

Ah, interesting. I wonder what the likelihood is of Ethiopia claiming it considering they already use .et (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.et )
00:43:10	Shubham's Notetaker (Otter.ai):	Shubham is on a Basic Otter plan with 30 minute meetings. To record longer meetings, upgrade to Pro: https://otter.ai/pricing?utm_source=oa-chat-basic
00:44:12	Vandan | MetaMask:	Thank you for continuing to push this forward.
