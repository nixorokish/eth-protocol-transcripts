00:20:35	Allan | Offchain Labs:	Can you share anything more about the Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL)?
00:21:44	qedk:	Bit of a divergent topic, but have we thought about extending FillInstruction to be non-EVM specific, specifically something like uint64 chainId -> string domain (CAIP2 identifier), happy to bring this up somewhere else if someone can point me (the TG group?)

For Arbitrum One, a hybrid proof system is the next step (subject to DAO governance), but net new Arbitrum chains could zk prove by default

that’s a good use case. I would guess 7786 for mint-burn/bridging primitives. would think of OIF for intent layer operations/apps building “on” the mint-burn asset

01:08:02	qedk:	Isn’t it easier to use Turnkey/Privy for wallet management? Too expensive or something else?
01:08:58	Ash Ahmed:	We’re building on top of privy at the moment, but the base privy wallet alone doesn’t do enough for user key guarantees - they have a global backend signer that we put stronger guardrails around in our own TEE so users know for sure what we’re allowed to do/can't
01:09:10	qedk:	Reacted to "We’re building on to..." with 👍
01:09:32	Allan | Offchain Labs:	Replying to "We’re building on to..."

considered ZeroDev?
01:10:09	Kanishk | Across:	nice presentation axal team!
01:10:14	Ash Ahmed:	@Ash3156 on telegram if anyone’s further interested!
01:10:16	qedk:	Replying to "We’re building on to..."

Turnkey allows you to verify TEE attestations, does Privy have that too? What guarantees are missing?
01:10:17	Ash Ahmed:	Reacted to "nice presentation ax..." with ❤️
01:10:32	Fabrice Cheng:	Replying to "We’re building on to..."

Happy to put you in touch with Coinbase Embedded Wallet if you’re interested. I believe they solved for it.

We use Privy, the TEE gives us additional security guarantees, and is also a great way to switch wallet providers in the future

01:15:33	qedk:	This is a great idea, happy to dogfood this with Nexus, is there anyone else using this in prod already?
01:15:41	Dev:	Replying to "We’re building on..."

Hey @qedk allows us to have custom permissions for rebalancing user wallets in the future, that enables us to take actions on user wallets verifiably
01:15:54	Ash Ahmed:	Really sick would love to explore using this - out of curiosity is there a USDC-specific use case you all are excited about for this
01:15:58	Jim | LI.FI:	could we get that excalidraw link? want to dive more. or if the repo is easier
