00:31:05	Nam:	Is multi-proving about supporting this proof system specifically for the built-in canonical rollup bridges, or for applications using the multiprover?

00:34:11	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	What’s the name of the project @dmarz ?
00:34:47	dmarz:	idk i guess we need a fun code name or something haha, WGTALM isn't too sexy
00:34:57	Kanishk | Across:	Reacted to "idk i guess we nee..." with 😂
00:35:18	dmarz:	in terms of code bases and such it will be PoCs for a bit so there wont be one source of that for a while. I think the goal would be for it to be in the EF repo likely long term for neutrality

00:38:08	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Demo?
00:39:53	p g:	@dmarz is multi-prover differ going to be like DVN solution by LayerZero ( afaik it allows multiple proof providers like Google Cloud + LayerZero Labs + Netherlands etc.) ?

00:42:03	Joshua Rudolf:	@Kiryl would be curious to hear more about any trust assumptions / offchain components around the “approval system"
00:42:19	Nam:	Replying to "o link?"

I interpreted his answer to be no
00:42:30	Nam:	Replying to "o link?"

I.e. its about replacing the native proof system
00:44:12	Nam:	Replying to "o link?"

I'm biased of course, but it does seem like another instance of fragemented "modiular verification" interfaces

00:47:46	Stas:	This sounds like an allowance specific solution? My understanding is that when you build x-chain solutions you need to deal with a larger scale of ops, including execution which is all vendor specific. Am I missing something?
00:47:57	p g:	Replying to "o link?"

Ofc — the vision is definitely bigger here. Would be interesting to see how Optimism / Arbitrum would react to the proposal once ready.

00:50:53	Shahrukh Rao:	Replying to "This sounds like an ..."

The idea here is to provide tooling for abstraction to initialize execution without enshrining any specific execution if I understand your question
