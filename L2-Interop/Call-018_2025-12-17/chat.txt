00:20:59	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	Do the chains settle via ZK Gateway? So chains need to wait for ZK Gateway to settle before the funds can be withdrawn and then executed on?
00:22:10	frangio:	how many of these prividiums are there in prod currently? or coming soon?
00:26:08	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	Chain operators still see data, other users don’t see each others transactions
00:33:03	Joshua Rudolf:	Would love more eyes on 7828 and 7930
00:34:15	Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS:	Latest on 7930: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7930 

7828 still a WIP
00:34:15	teddy:	https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7930-interoperable-addresses/23365/15
forum thread for 7930
00:34:17	Joshua Rudolf:	Anyone want to weigh in on the question from Orca? (Interoperable address and interoperable name both existing inside 7930)
00:35:47	Joshua Rudolf:	Or should “interoperable name” move to e.g. ERC-7828 (which currently is about ENS interoperable addresses)
00:36:12	Joshua Rudolf:	7930 = binary format interop addresses
7828 = human-readable interop addresses
00:36:57	teddy:	pls let's take the discussion to the forum: https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/erc-7930-interoperable-addresses/23365/15✨

@Premm.eth have you shared your take in any forum post?
00:43:47	Joshua Rudolf:	https://ethresear.ch/t/scope-synchronous-composability-protocol-for-ethereum/22978
00:48:41	Premm.eth:	voting
00:49:19	Joshua Rudolf:	We could get fast async though
00:49:45	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Async is a step by step solution (not great UX) and lacks atomicity
00:49:48	jesus:	bc i might need an auth root for example in case of identity
00:49:49	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Which is critical
00:49:49	Premm.eth:	An identity can be verified in advance using a zk proof.
00:49:52	jim:	how can synchronisity be achieved if chains have different rate - like arbitrum sub-second and ethereum's 12 second
and hypothetical MegaETH becoming an L2 ...
00:50:44	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	Replying to "how can synchronisit..."

Depends on the solution, specifically we use mailboxes that validate against each other so no need to sync block production
00:53:00	Premm.eth:	Consuming a nonce on a L2 on another chain. So a PoP airdrop, you need to consume the nonce from worldChain to use on another chain.
00:53:49	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "We could get fast as..."

yap
00:53:57	noahpravecek:	Replying to "We could get fast as..."

yep
00:54:31	noahpravecek:	Arc and Tempo have repeatedly said their reasoning for L1s was fast finality. Also with fast async L1 intro you won’t need app developers to deploy on 20+ chains.
00:55:12	Barnabé Monnot:	thoughts on the value of sync composability as more apps start doing “app-controlled execution”? (fka app specific sequencing)
orthogonal questions?
00:55:28	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	How can you do flashloans asynchronously, though?
00:55:46	jesus:	Replying to "How can you do fla..."

i don't think so!
00:55:46	noahpravecek:	Replying to "thoughts on the valu..."

It ends up being shared sequencing basically but it would just be 1 shared sequencer for a vertically integrated app so at that point why not use an app chain?

Potentially. I think you could design one for it

00:57:29	noahpravecek:	Replying to "How can you do flash..."

Ive looked at this post in the past as a reference for this. You basically just need to allow a borrow to open and close with a proof or the whole bundle fails.
00:58:23	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Reacted to "Ive looked at this p..." with 👀
00:58:40	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	You dont need SC for that either
00:58:46	jesus:	Reacted to "Ive looked at this..." with 👀
00:58:47	Lumi | Offchain Labs:	You can abstract swaps to lower liquidity tokens. Also low liquidity tokens would be concentrated in one place anyways
00:58:57	noahpravecek:	We will end up having 1000s of rollups because institutions are using them as better ledgers. L2 #50 could be on a shared settlement solution and most of the new chains will find MMs if they build something of value.
00:59:42	Joshua Rudolf:	Shared vision = ethereum feels like a single chain
Open question: is sync composability necessary ingredient to accomplish this
00:59:45	Premm.eth:	Then the contracts will have to be designed very differently. SC will make existing contracts just work as is?

01:01:11	noahpravecek:	You won’t have long latency tho for settlement. ZK proofs are getting faster than ever before.
01:01:40	noahpravecek:	You can have fast settlement
01:01:48	@incompleteloop - Spire Labs:	Replying to "You won’t have lo..."

fast is relative
01:02:14	noahpravecek:	If we had cheaper ZK verification on L1 then you could have ZK rollups settling basically every 30 seconds relatively soon
01:02:23	noahpravecek:	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

Sub 1 minute settlement?
01:02:26	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

TEE 🙂
01:02:40	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Yap - or with TEEs
01:02:57	@incompleteloop - Spire Labs:	Replying to "You won’t have lo..."

try debugging in a TEE 😉
01:03:44	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

tried
01:03:56	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

https://status.t1protocol.com/  :P
01:04:03	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

trying* 😄 😄
01:04:28	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	Replying to "You won’t have long ..."

But srsly: modern TEEs are way better in terms of DevEx
01:04:35	Joshua Rudolf:	Think we prob still need to better define the things that are truly only possible with synchronous

agreed but "shoving in a tee" is a meme

def appreciate the trying, we are too

01:05:44	Alon Muroch | SSVLabs:	❤️
01:06:00	Orest Tarasiuk (t1):	(we shouldn’t have any quick final thoughts ;) )
01:06:06	jesus:	Replying to "How can you do fla..."

so, after some reading, my conlusion is:
You need changes on consensus layer ( ok)
But you cannot close ablock, until somehting happens, meaning that, even if you ahve better latancy, you need synch communication
