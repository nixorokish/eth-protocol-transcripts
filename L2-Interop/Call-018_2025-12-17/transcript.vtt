00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.089
noahpravecek: Testing? Is my audio working okay?

2
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.460
Joshua Rudolf: It is.

3
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.490
noahpravecek: Great.

4
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.699
noahpravecek: Thanks for having me.

5
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.930
Joshua Rudolf: Of course.

6
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.560
Joshua Rudolf: How's life, Noah?

7
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.360
noahpravecek: Doing pretty good. How are things on your end? Been a while since we chatted.

8
00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.650
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, doing good.

9
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.840
noahpravecek: Nice.

10
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.890
noahpravecek: Got any fun plans for the holidays?

11
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.690
Joshua Rudolf: Not at the moment. Maybe a last-minute trip somewhere, but…

12
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.380
Joshua Rudolf: So nice to not do anything, I guess.

13
00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:03.120
noahpravecek: Yeah, that's nice as well. I'm going home to see family, so I'm excited about that. It's been, I guess, only a month since I've seen him, but still like to see him.

14
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.659
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, yeah. Where is, where is home?

15
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.870
noahpravecek: So, I live in New York. I have family… I grew up near Chicago in the suburbs. My family moved into the city after myself and my siblings left.

16
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.729
noahpravecek: So, going back to Chicago, so it should be nice.

17
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.160
Joshua Rudolf: Suburbs?

18
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.240
noahpravecek: Not the burps, go on to Irving Park, that's where they moved after.

19
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.990
Joshua Rudolf: Oh, okay.

20
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:41.199
noahpravecek: They're the only people I've ever known to upsize, not downsize. When the kids moved out, they went from a 4,000 square foot house to, like, I think it's, like, 4,500 or 5,000 square foot loft, but it's all on one level. So there's no stairs, so they're like, it's better, there's no stairs, and it's, like.

21
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.889
noahpravecek: There's no stairs, there's, like, 25-foot ceilings, like, it's, like, not 25, but, like, probably 20 feet ceiling, it's…

22
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.990
noahpravecek: It's insane, but they're happy, which is all that matters.

23
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.549
Joshua Rudolf: Not a bad way to spend your retirement sort of years.

24
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.160
noahpravecek: Good.

25
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:58.270
Joshua Rudolf: Hey, everybody.

26
00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.110
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): eyes.

27
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.249
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): New faces here, or new names in the group.

28
00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.620
Friederike Ernst: I'm petrified.

29
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.400
Joshua Rudolf: I'm anonymous.

30
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.200
Friederike Ernst: I think.

31
00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:08.799
Joshua Rudolf: Excited to have you, thanks for joining.

32
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.640
Joshua Rudolf: Good to have some fresh, fresh faces, fresh perspectives.

33
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.750
Joshua Rudolf: It's called… Bubble?

34
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.750
noahpravecek: Oh.

35
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.069
noahpravecek: Always good to get outside the bubble.

36
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.639
Joshua Rudolf: We'll start in a minute. Hey, Lumi.

37
00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.100
Joshua Rudolf: I think with, this time of year, I might have a little bit lighter attendance.

38
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.219
Joshua Rudolf: But we'll see.

39
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.239
Joshua Rudolf: It shows up.

40
00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:45.609
Joshua Rudolf: I think if Pepe joins from OpenZe… oh, there's Pepe. I think, we might, if it's okay, Noah, we might shuffle the schedule around a little bit, just so that Pepe can give a quick update on the OIF side of things. Is that okay? Just like a… I think maybe, Pepe, you just need, like, 5 minutes or less to give a quick.

41
00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.790
noahpravecek: Yeah, that's all good.

42
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.670
Pepe Blasco: I'm flexible. Okay.

43
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:55.799
Pepe Blasco: But, yeah, just requested to share some updates on the broadcaster, and…

44
00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:16.750
Pepe Blasco: I have to be fast, so just some context for those of you that are not familiar with Broadcaster. It's a protocol initially developed by the Arbitrum team, the Oxin Labs team, and it's meant to be a fully trustless message-passing system, so…

45
00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:32.739
Pepe Blasco: Inside OIF, we are using this for… as an oracle. It's relatively slow, because it needs for settlements to… to be executed, so in a lot of cases, this means over 7 days of…

46
00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:39.810
Pepe Blasco: confirmation for the Oracle to be viable, but…

47
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:55.030
Pepe Blasco: We are, obviously, depending on the network, that time can be smaller, and as you know, the time of roll-ups hopefully will be reduced in… in…

48
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.790
Pepe Blasco: Limit to long term.

49
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:16.170
Pepe Blasco: So, this was initially developed by Oxin Labs, by the Arbitrum Foundation, yeah, 2035. And we from Open 17 took over the final development and polishing of it, a couple of months ago. The initial,

50
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:34.390
Pepe Blasco: core contracts of the protocol have been audited, and I think the audit report will be public this week, for sure, so we can share that when it's ready. The architecture of the

51
00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:53.880
Pepe Blasco: system basically requires a core contract, a broadcaster contract on each network, and then for each architecture of the networks to have a specific prover. So, we are… we've also developed provers for 6 networks, or 6 architectures, Arbitrum, Optimus.

52
00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.840
Pepe Blasco: linear, CKSYSYNC, typo, and scroll. Those provers are…

53
00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:14.339
Pepe Blasco: ending the development cycle right now, and are actively being tested in testnets. We'll probably do an audit in February.

54
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:19.080
Pepe Blasco: And after that will be deployed to mainnets. So…

55
00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:24.009
Pepe Blasco: This is a fully decentralized protocol. Anyone will be able to deploy their

56
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:32.719
Pepe Blasco: own contracts and verify their own messages, Open Sappling will deploy the reference

57
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:46.339
Pepe Blasco: Contracts and provers to be… to be used, but again, any particular team that may be interested in running their own set of contracts for whatever reason will be able to do so.

58
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:59.329
Pepe Blasco: depending on the network, these messages are broadcasted and passed along automatically. Some networks basically put the status or the…

59
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:07.890
Pepe Blasco: information from the Layer 1 into the Layer 2 automatically, while others need a pusher.

60
00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:21.490
Pepe Blasco: that pusher will also be available, and guides on how to transmit the pusher will be available for the public. So, the broadcaster protocol is likely gonna see

61
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:32.650
Pepe Blasco: like, real use cases in the first quarter of the year. If anyone is interested in tinkering around, playing around, experimenting with it.

62
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:42.639
Pepe Blasco: Right now, it's in a decent status, so that we can get started on testing testnets. So, if you're building on it, or you're interested in

63
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:51.350
Pepe Blasco: Exploring, breaking, auditing, testing, feel free to reach out to me.

64
00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:58.119
Pepe Blasco: through Josh, or directly in Telegram, and we are happy to collaborate on that.

65
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:11.180
Pepe Blasco: Can you send some info on the testnet? I will… I will now share, the existing deployments, but there is no…

66
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.780
Pepe Blasco: And…

67
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:24.079
Pepe Blasco: kind of app to interact with these things. It's meant as an oracle, so anyone interested in interacting with the contracts will have to generate their own proofs, and

68
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:37.210
Pepe Blasco: it's not a lightweight protocol. It's pretty heavy, it comes… it's the drawbacks that comes with real decentralization and real trustlessness.

69
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.820
Pepe Blasco: Any questions?

70
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:51.310
Joshua Rudolf: Cool.

71
00:10:51.560 --> 00:11:01.809
Joshua Rudolf: Thank you, Pepe. Appreciate the last minute jumping in. Excited to have this, and yeah, thanks to Arbitrum and everyone who's been a part of this. Excited to have it as part of the OIF, as the…

72
00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.150
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, Broadcaster, Oracle.

73
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:11.930
Joshua Rudolf: Cool, so maybe we can switch back. I think we'll have some more OIF updates later on in the call, but maybe we can switch…

74
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:21.739
Joshua Rudolf: back over to you, Noah, to share some, yeah, presentation I think you have prepared on the ZK Sync Interop.

75
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.190
noahpravecek: Sounds good. Glad to share.

76
00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:27.520
noahpravecek: I just need to request the sharing thing.

77
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:28.010
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, nice.

78
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.600
noahpravecek: Cool.

79
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:29.650
noahpravecek: Thanks.

80
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:35.530
noahpravecek: Okay.

81
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:41.439
noahpravecek: Do I not have systems enabled?

82
00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:44.100
noahpravecek: Okay…

83
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.309
noahpravecek: I'm gonna have to quit and reopen Zoom.

84
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:53.080
Joshua Rudolf: Okay.

85
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:59.030
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Probably you don't need to. Just try. If it's macOS, it's a fake warning, just try.

86
00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.309
noahpravecek: Okay, yeah, that worked.

87
00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:04.139
Joshua Rudolf: Horace always comes through with that tip.

88
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:07.620
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): It's so annoying, like, they've had this for years.

89
00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.840
noahpravecek: Yeah, it is a bit silly.

90
00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:28.579
noahpravecek: Yeah, excited to be presenting today. Today, I'll be talking about scaling Ethereum's liquidity with L1 Interop that is provided by ZK Stack. Our goal with this is to solve DeFi's structural cold start problem, and my background is I'm the Director of Interop on the product side at MetaLabs.

91
00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:41.309
noahpravecek: So the current issue, and we see this with every single new chain, whether it's, an L2 or a L1, we saw off BarroChain, we saw off plasma, we've seen off all the different L2s, is every chain starts from zero currently.

92
00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:54.110
noahpravecek: Every single application that you want on that chain needs to redeploy. We need to rebuild liquidity. They run these massive liquidity mining campaigns, where they spend tens, if not hundreds of millions of dollars to essentially subsidize DeFi liquidity.

93
00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:57.610
noahpravecek: And you end up having very… Very…

94
00:12:57.730 --> 00:13:07.099
noahpravecek: very mercenary capital that comes onto your blockchain, and gives you the appearance that your blockchain is succeeding, but when those incentives dry off.

95
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:23.250
noahpravecek: Ethereum still holds the majority of real, durable DeFi liquidity that stays for cycles, between cycles, essentially. So the structural cold start problem repeats across every single new ecosystem, and it's something we notice in our ecosystem as well as other ecosystems that we're launching as well.

96
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.740
noahpravecek: So, for the longest time, Ethereum.

97
00:13:26.050 --> 00:13:32.679
noahpravecek: Ethereum has used L2s to scale its performance, but for the first time, L2s can now scale Ethereum liquidity via ZK Stack.

98
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:44.310
noahpravecek: So the reason why we're able to do this, and I'll go more into the tech part of it later, is we recently came out with the CKSYNC Atlas upgrade, which is our new upgrade that gives us even equivalence 15,000 transactions per second.

99
00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:48.850
noahpravecek: One second, CK. Proving time and our proving costs have dropped dramatically.

100
00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.170
noahpravecek: Have dropped dramatically as well.

101
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:58.360
noahpravecek: The second thing we recently came out with, and this has been in development for a while as well, alongside the Atlas upgrade.

102
00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:13.070
noahpravecek: is something called sequencing private names. So it's the first blockchain platform to essentially unite the verifiability and interoperability that we've come to love of public chains with the control, privacy, and compliance needs for institutions to actually operate on-chain.

103
00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:29.519
noahpravecek: So our solution essentially marries Ethereum with CK proofs by combining the most neutral global settlement layer with the strongest guarantees and the largest network effects with CK proofs to allow institutions to operate compliantly while still having interoperability and allowing for high throughput at a low cost.

104
00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:38.349
noahpravecek: So what L1 Interop is, is the first thing that we demoed a couple of weeks ago was users on any ZK chain, it can now deposit into Aave on Ethereum.

105
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:53.839
noahpravecek: borrow assets like Go or USDC or any other asset on Aave, and access Ethereum DeFi without switching networks. They maintain one wallet, one identity, and one streamlined user experience, and private teams allow institutions, when they're operating their own private

106
00:14:53.850 --> 00:15:08.080
noahpravecek: execution environment to access these markets as well. So instead of each individual institution needing to have a forked instance of Aave, Morpho or any of these other large DeFi protocols, they can now tap into Ethereum DeFi from their L2,

107
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:21.439
noahpravecek: Allowing them to do things that were previously not possible, because typically institutions do not want to operate on public chains showing off everything that they're doing. But if you can allow them to operate privately for the things that need to remain privately.

108
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:29.280
noahpravecek: private, essentially, but it actually still has happened now on DeFi. We've seen that they are very excited to use that productive overall, and we think that's how you bring

109
00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.800
noahpravecek: institutions back to DeFi, essentially.

110
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:42.769
noahpravecek: So the way it works at a high level is the user signs two transactions on the L2. Transaction 1 is essentially having your funds get withdrawn to a cryptographically bound aliased account on the L1,

111
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:52.210
noahpravecek: And the second transaction is an interop bundle that contains a list of L1 DeFi actions. Optionally, you can also bridge tokens back to the L2 automatically as well.

112
00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.009
noahpravecek: So the way it works…

113
00:15:54.330 --> 00:16:02.030
noahpravecek: And this diagram just essentially goes over exactly what I said before, is to the user, they just fund their ALAS account.

114
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.610
noahpravecek: In this case, with ETH.

115
00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:22.319
noahpravecek: They execute the action, which is depositing into Aave on L1, getting a real position, they receive the A token in that account on L1, and then they can view a unified balance. So the user, it's like they're never leaving home, and, well, this work still happens on Ethereum, so there's no commingling of user funds as well, which is crucial for systems like this to scale.

116
00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:37.409
noahpravecek: So, the reason why this is now possible is due to us having much faster CK proof generation and settlement than in the past. So, airborne proofs typically can be generated around one second… oh, are there comments.

117
00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:43.050
noahpravecek: Oh, got it Sorry. Sorry, chat.

118
00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:59.780
noahpravecek: And withdrawals can finalize on L1 in minutes. We also have a multi-implementation sequencer, which hardens against bugs and attacks, and the alias account is a deterministic L1 address mapped to a user's L2 account, and they… it doesn't require new keys, and it doesn't require another custodian on top, and it's very easy to support as well.

119
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:19.769
noahpravecek: And the interop transaction bundles can essentially contain arbitrary actions. So in this demo we did with Aave, it would be relatively straightforward to do it with Morpho, Uniswap, Pendle, anything else you want to do on Ethereum. It preserves the full Ethereum visibility, and the bundle is executed via the alias account.

120
00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:29.870
noahpravecek: And it's a really seamless UX, so these borrowed tokens can be bridged to the L2, and the user never has to leave the chain, never has to handle all one gas or accounts manually.

121
00:17:30.110 --> 00:17:30.850
noahpravecek: And…

122
00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:40.789
noahpravecek: With Prividiums, this allows institutions to get private access to lending markets, liquidity pools, yield markets, usage of existing protocols, not forks, internal workflows stay private, while the market actions settle out there.

123
00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:54.040
noahpravecek: They can also do things such as optimizing collateral for treasury and credit funding operations, moving funds between L2 and L1 in minutes, and accessing intraday liquidity and hedging capabilities, private operations on L2, market interactions on L1.

124
00:17:54.290 --> 00:18:04.349
noahpravecek: And the thing that I'm really excited about as well is really around the trading use cases and more advanced use cases, I would say, where you can essentially run all of your

125
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:18.060
noahpravecek: more computationally expensive logic on the L2, like, a matching engine, credit… credit systems, like, order books, things such as that on the L2, but still access collateral on ETHL1, so that allows for

126
00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:34.629
noahpravecek: essentially, there's a structural mismatch right now between ETHL1 liquidity costs and ETHL2. We actually went and we spoke to all the different teams that run the liquidity farming campaigns and run the different Vault systems, and what we realized is if you look at Morpho and Aave on ETHL1,

127
00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:43.040
noahpravecek: They're… users are fine receiving a lower rate on those protocols than they are if they're on an L2.

128
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:46.219
noahpravecek: So if you're on an… if you are on L2 or… or an…

129
00:18:46.230 --> 00:19:02.939
noahpravecek: or an Alta one, you always have to pay greater than the Aave or Morpho rate that is on Ethereum, because there's the existing… not existing, there's the extra risk of me moving capital to your chain, and there's quite a few LPs or liquid providers that don't want to move to those chains.

130
00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:17.670
noahpravecek: So due to this, you can actually get capital for cheaper, so this offers a structural advantage for L2s that tap into the system, because they're able to essentially get capital that would be buying at a lower rate compared to every other alt-chain system.

131
00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:18.909
noahpravecek: Or are there all two?

132
00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:23.349
noahpravecek: And long-term, we believe this allows Ethereum to really become the capital hub.

133
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:36.610
noahpravecek: CK chains and private AMs allow for sovereign and sometimes private compute. Ethereum gets the shared settlement and liquidity base, and usually you get the best of both worlds, having institutional privacy, public market depth, and a unified ecosystem, rather than fragmented islands.

134
00:19:37.270 --> 00:19:40.150
noahpravecek: And… Frequently asked questions as well.

135
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:46.459
noahpravecek: Today, a separate account finalizes withdrawals and executes bundles, but soon applications will be able to charge L1 gas on L2.

136
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:51.040
noahpravecek: Supporting new protocols is very straightforward. It's generic, so it's very quick to add them.

137
00:19:51.100 --> 00:20:08.000
noahpravecek: Protocol teams can also do this themselves. If you are a protocol team interested in this, feel free to reach out. We'd be glad to support. And it only costs a couple dollars per transaction. The main delay is Ethereum finality, and the final, and essentially the frequency of settlement as well.

138
00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:12.980
noahpravecek: And one transaction is coming soon, that will likely be done with an account abstraction.

139
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.160
noahpravecek: System.

140
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.489
noahpravecek: So yeah, that's everything. Thanks so much for having me.

141
00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:25.579
Joshua Rudolf: Questions for Noah?

142
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:32.680
Joshua Rudolf: Maybe one question to start off. You mentioned it here a little bit, but…

143
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:42.490
Joshua Rudolf: I guess, yeah. Can you share more around how fast this… like, it sounds like this is sort of on the order of minutes rather than seconds.

144
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:46.100
Joshua Rudolf: For most blows today, bottlenecked by the L1.

145
00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:59.609
Joshua Rudolf: Will that, in practice, prevent a lot of the usefulness, if this is minutes? Like, are you… how do you think about this, and users' willingness to wait minutes for certain flows?

146
00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:13.640
noahpravecek: Yeah, so on that side, the primary customer for this is actually institutions. The majority of ZKSYNC L2s are… that are coming out that are new L2s are using our private idiom stack, so they're institutions that are managing collateral. So for them.

147
00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:21.880
noahpravecek: When we're able to tell them, okay, you can now manage your lending workflows, and it's gonna take 10 minutes, rather than them having to call their lawyer,

148
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:39.050
noahpravecek: enter in a new counterparty agreement and go through all of the headache. Like, currently lending in traditional markets, it just takes a lot longer. It's not as programmatic. So the fact that they can do this for any asset at any time, and set this up in a matter of minutes, is, like.

149
00:21:39.290 --> 00:21:58.119
noahpravecek: a massive change, and much faster, so for crypto people, it's obviously something where it's, like, it's not as fast as they're used to, but I think over time, the bet that we're making is the majority of new capital and new users coming into blockchain systems won't necessarily be a crypto native, and it'll also be used more and more so in a backend, like, capacity.

150
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:05.700
noahpravecek: So, if it's a back-end capacity, you don't necessarily mind as much about things like this, because it's so much faster than your current system.

151
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:08.400
Joshua Rudolf: Yep.

152
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:09.470
Joshua Rudolf: Chris.

153
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:14.049
Joshua Rudolf: You bet.

154
00:22:14.050 --> 00:22:14.430
noahpravecek: Earth.

155
00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:22.209
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): On the, 1 second latency within the cluster,

156
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:36.660
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): what makes it such that, I guess it's, like, a ZK stack, L2 or L3, getting, like, a proof done for, I guess, some significant gas? Why is it so much faster?

157
00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:42.190
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): than actually proving to the L1, in terms of, prover time.

158
00:22:42.820 --> 00:22:43.590
noahpravecek: Yeah, so the way that…

159
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.780
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Due to, like, hashing? Like, ZK friendliness? Where is this big discrepancy from?

160
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:58.670
noahpravecek: Yeah, so the reason why is there… you can obviously settle to the L1 more frequently, as well, over time. There…

161
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:10.659
noahpravecek: what the gateway is doing is essentially aggregating the proofs, so when you need to aggregate proofs across multiple chains, that's always going to take a while. And there's also… within our system, we essentially…

162
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.160
noahpravecek: have two different types of proofs. We have the fry proofs, which are very fast…

163
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.879
noahpravecek: fast, and then we have the snark proof, which is…

164
00:23:18.210 --> 00:23:22.380
noahpravecek: the proof that gets verified on L1. The snorkeification process takes

165
00:23:22.770 --> 00:23:28.310
noahpravecek: a couple of minutes, currently. So that… that obviously causes delays for things.

166
00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.550
noahpravecek: Gotcha, thank you.

167
00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.170
Joshua Rudolf: Couple of questions in the chat, but maybe, Lumi, do you want to read out your question?

168
00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:52.340
Lumi | Offchain Labs: Yeah, so the chains are settling to ZK Gateway as pseudo-L3s, so you… basically, the chain operator or the user needs to wait for ZK Gateway to settle onto L1 before any actions can be executed, right?

169
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.880
noahpravecek: Yep.

170
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.079
Lumi | Offchain Labs: How frequently does ZKK waste at all currently?

171
00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:03.490
noahpravecek: It's… for us right now, CK Gateway will be settling quite frequently.

172
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:08.299
Lumi | Offchain Labs: Isn't there still a 3-hour withdrawal period? Like, artificial?

173
00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.760
noahpravecek: Once we had had…

174
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.980
noahpravecek: Now that we have the multiple implementation of sequencers, we don't have the 3-hour withdrawal window delay anymore.

175
00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:19.160
Kalman Lajko: just to quickly end up here, I think Lumi…

176
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:29.570
Kalman Lajko: knows the error implementation more, which has this, finalized withdrawal, but the new zkSync gateway will be on the Atlas upgrade, so…

177
00:24:29.700 --> 00:24:31.270
Kalman Lajko: It's not really relevant here.

178
00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.389
noahpravecek: Thanks, Common.

179
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:37.110
noahpravecek: Arjun?

180
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.630
noahpravecek: I believe I'm pronounced that.

181
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:56.219
Anjan (Avail): Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. So, I did not follow much development of the Providium, but can you give me a thought, maybe a gist of how does it achieve the privacy guarantees, or what are the things that it offers, and how does it do that?

182
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.450
noahpravecek: Yeah, so for private idioms.

183
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:10.539
noahpravecek: Prividiums has a role-based access control system on top of it, so it gives you privacy in the same way that you would have privacy in, like, a traditional database. So you're able to essentially choose which users

184
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:22.650
noahpravecek: see which different smart contracts, and you can do different roles for different users, you can even allow for different applications to see different smart contracts as well, operating on the private end. It really allows for a much more

185
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.779
noahpravecek: Granular level of control for the chain operator, that previously wasn't available.

186
00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:29.650
noahpravecek: Hope that helps.

187
00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:37.039
Anjan (Avail): Yeah, but does it use, anyhow, stealth addresses for transactional linkability, maybe?

188
00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:51.520
noahpravecek: Privadium is an enterprise product, so it's not necessarily doing privacy like Zcache, it's more privacy like an institutional level of privacy, so privacy like Snapchat or email.

189
00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.499
Anjan (Avail): Okay, makes sense. Thank you.

190
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:56.350
noahpravecek: Yeah, no problem.

191
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.870
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Sit.

192
00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:05.630
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): So that means you guys are not using hiding, like, you are not using ZK, Snox, you are just using Snox, or stocks, right?

193
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:06.870
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): for.

194
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:13.400
noahpravecek: And you're shooting… For Prividium in particular, we… it is a ZK roll-up. It's…

195
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.500
noahpravecek: It's a ZK rope that is a Validium.

196
00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:31.149
noahpravecek: And the data is held off-chain, and then we have a role-based access control system to essentially allow enterprises to choose who can see which things on their chain, and they can define user groups, different roles, different… even contract-level permissioning.

197
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:37.669
noahpravecek: So, that's the primary use case for it. It's not necessarily designed to be used like a mixer or anything like that.

198
00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:55.390
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Gotcha. So it means, in particular, you are posting a normal SNARC 2011, which leaks information about what happened, but you assume, because it's, like, in practice, quite little, that it's private enough. And you basically.

199
00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:55.770
noahpravecek: It doesn't…

200
00:26:55.770 --> 00:26:58.020
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): restrict access on RPC level.

201
00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:09.750
noahpravecek: It does not leak information to what happened. The way that our system works is you are not leaking information about what happened on… on, essentially, the execution.

202
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.809
noahpravecek: of the L2 itself.

203
00:27:14.370 --> 00:27:17.480
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Okay, so it's a different prover than the app.

204
00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.430
noahpravecek: It's not a… It is the airbender prover.

205
00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:31.789
noahpravecek: The way that we have designed this system is any personal identifying information for the different institutions that are operating their own private idiom is kept private and kept on their own service.

206
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:49.000
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Okay, so maybe this is just a theoretical nuance then. So is it adequate to say the RPC is the gateway to, like, basically authorizing this user to access this data and another user to access another data?

207
00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:55.950
noahpravecek: Yeah, they get… the RPC for the private idiom is where all of the rules… rules are set.

208
00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.250
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Makes sense.

209
00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:00.830
Joshua Rudolf: Mmm.

210
00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:11.250
Joshua Rudolf: We're getting a little bit low on time, maybe I can read… there's one question from Frangio in the chat, I'll read it. How many of these providiums are there in Prad currently, or coming soon?

211
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:18.330
noahpravecek: So we currently have one live already with a company called Memento that's operating it for Deutsche Bank, and we have

212
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:26.219
noahpravecek: Other major Prividium announcements will be coming out in Q1, so we have a lot more that are on the way.

213
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:33.130
noahpravecek: So yeah, most of them are going live in Q1. We have a few that came out that were recently announced, such as LNET, that's doing

214
00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:44.060
noahpravecek: that's launching on private aim at LATAM. We have a lot more that are essentially coming on in Q2. Due to the nature of most of these customers, we can't say them publicly until they're announced, just due to NDAs.

215
00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:48.030
Joshua Rudolf: Got it.

216
00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:51.009
Joshua Rudolf: Thank you, Noah. This was great.

217
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:52.729
noahpravecek: Thanks for having me.

218
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.799
Joshua Rudolf: Appreciate you coming on.

219
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:55.100
Joshua Rudolf: Cool.

220
00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:07.299
Joshua Rudolf: Next up on the agenda, OIF, some more, updates, I think, on that side of things, and I will kick it over to Orca, if you're available.

221
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.530
Orca 0x: Hey, yeah, sure, how much… how much time,

222
00:29:11.630 --> 00:29:14.640
Orca 0x: Is that just for context, if you said we were a bit behind?

223
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:21.600
Joshua Rudolf: I think we can… yeah, we got at least 10 minutes, let's say, here, for… Yeah.

224
00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:29.440
Orca 0x: Cool, let me… probably will not reach that, I guess I'm gonna run through a couple of things. Can you see…

225
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.040
Orca 0x: this screen.

226
00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:33.280
Joshua Rudolf: Yep.

227
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:41.659
Orca 0x: Okay, great. So, I guess just a few things, OIF-related, and then one interop address thing, just to make folks aware.

228
00:29:41.850 --> 00:29:58.209
Orca 0x: Alright, so first is asset discovery, so interop providers invariably have an API for their chain or asset support, so… and… but this wasn't part of the OIF specs, sort of API specs currently, which just cover getting quotes and sending orders.

229
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:06.249
Orca 0x: So we've added this to the OIF specs, and it'd just be good to get feedback if you're a person who've either

230
00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:21.589
Orca 0x: has, such an API, or, like, has opinions, so it's pretty simple. It's based on the solver, the existing OIF solver implementation, just as a starting point, but, there's probably room for a bit of bike shedding, but also just be interested in,

231
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:32.960
Orca 0x: People see it because you see different approaches. Some people have a separate endpoint for chains and for tokens, and some support routes, specific routes. So making people aware of this and soliciting feedback.

232
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:43.739
Orca 0x: Similarly, we're, at Wonderland, we're working on the cross-chain module of the interop SDK, we're trying it out on different OF-compliant interop solutions,

233
00:30:44.530 --> 00:30:49.270
Orca 0x: with our… with a sort of OIF provider, which basically implements the spec.

234
00:30:49.330 --> 00:31:06.659
Orca 0x: We've existed… found some areas where existing fighters are not aligned with the IF specs, so I think that's one where we're talking to OpenZeppelin about the Solver and aggregator, and we've also been trying out, Lifi. We'll be reaching out to teams to check if things are expected or unexpected in terms of any, like.

235
00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:18.059
Orca 0x: digression from the spec, but if there are other folks who are running OIF-compliant solvers or endpoints, we'd love to take them for a spin. So, as I said, we're aware of

236
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:20.450
Orca 0x: Open Zeppelin and,

237
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:24.759
Orca 0x: Lifi, but let us know if there are others, that we can be testing with.

238
00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.630
Orca 0x: I'll keep… I'll keep rolling,

239
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.199
Orca 0x: in the same vein, in the SDK, one thing we're looking at is,

240
00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:41.220
Orca 0x: quote validation, so this is when you're actually interacting with an API, you'll send maybe a

241
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:54.849
Orca 0x: an intent, and you'll get back a quote and something to sign. Obviously, there's a risk there if it's a server you don't trust, because they could give you back anything to sign. So one thing we're looking at adding to the SDK is obviously sort of client-side validation.

242
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.779
Orca 0x: So if…

243
00:31:57.090 --> 00:32:05.599
Orca 0x: Anyone else is thinking about those kind of things, that's passing whether it's a transaction to make on-chain, if it's a user-submitted,

244
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:21.019
Orca 0x: intent, or if it's a 712 thing to sign, making sure that you're actually, signing something that you're happy with that actually meets your initial requirements. We'd be interested to talk to any other teams who've thought about that problem, not just trusting what you get back from an API.

245
00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.760
Orca 0x: And then lastly,

246
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:39.900
Orca 0x: 7930, so this is in the slightly different thread, but related, so interoperable addresses. This is the spec which has undergone a lot of revision over the last couple of months, thanks to the, I think, the unruggable folks who are on the call.

247
00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:54.879
Orca 0x: who've, been collaborating with us on this. So we'd love to hear any feedback. If folks, someone read the spec a little while ago and thought it wasn't, wasn't that clear, like, hopefully it's better now. I think I did just want to draw this group's…

248
00:32:54.900 --> 00:33:05.220
Orca 0x: attention to, one thing which is a bit under discussion, so, currently 7930 defines both the interoperable address, which is binary, machine-readable.

249
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:13.739
Orca 0x: would look something like this, if you were to print it out. And it also defines interoperable names, that's a sort of, complementary,

250
00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:22.989
Orca 0x: string, which is passable by humans, I think there's some debate over whether it's readable by humans or not. So here you've got the, address, you've got the,

251
00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:28.440
Orca 0x: separators, and then you've got CIP identifiers and a checksum.

252
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:40.900
Orca 0x: And then the other, interoperable address, ELC, makes them more human-readable by introducing ENS support for addresses and chains. And the point of discussion has been

253
00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:51.710
Orca 0x: whether having both the address and the name in the same ELC is confusing, or potentially confusing for people who might be looking to either

254
00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:58.490
Orca 0x: use the standard in other ELCs or just implement things. So again, welcome, folks.

255
00:33:58.750 --> 00:34:06.120
Orca 0x: I guess we're posting on the forum to notify the recent changes, to get any eyes of people who haven't looked at the spec for a while.

256
00:34:06.850 --> 00:34:14.449
Orca 0x: But we'd also, yeah, we're thinking about this, or we've been discussing this specific question, just be good to see if there are any other opinions.

257
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:16.250
Orca 0x: Out there.

258
00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:23.429
Orca 0x: And that's… I'll stop sharing and look at the chat if there is any… Chat.

259
00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:32.770
Orca 0x: And yes, thanks, folks, for sharing the ERC's Frangio.

260
00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:44.850
frangio: Can you clarify what's being discussed? So the interoperable names are currently in 7930, and you are discussing whether to remove those?

261
00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.380
frangio: Annel them elsewhere?

262
00:34:48.150 --> 00:34:51.179
Orca 0x: Yes, I think… I don't know if Prem…

263
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:56.540
Orca 0x: is on… on the call, I think he is. But I think,

264
00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:08.109
Orca 0x: Yeah, this was based on some of his feedback, which was just saying that having the names and the addresses in the same thing then made it a bit unclear what a 7930 address

265
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:18.340
Orca 0x: meant, which of those sort of formats it meant. And so I think that there are obviously, like, a couple potential approaches, from where we are today.

266
00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.870
Orca 0x: But, yeah, maybe Prem, if you wanna… Outline your case.

267
00:35:23.490 --> 00:35:24.530
Premm.eth: Can you hear me?

268
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.830
Orca 0x: I can.

269
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.870
Premm.eth: Okay, good. Yes, so I, think this, discussion started, I think Teddy had, posted something about

270
00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:38.320
Premm.eth: I'm, clarifying the difference between the interoperable address and the interoperable maze.

271
00:35:38.590 --> 00:35:44.340
Premm.eth: And, my opinion was that it should be very clear when someone says 7930 address.

272
00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:49.359
Premm.eth: what they mean. And, I noticed, in the 8092 spec.

273
00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:53.360
Premm.eth: that, Steve Kaftman of Base Names was going to,

274
00:35:53.450 --> 00:36:07.080
Premm.eth: a particularly high degree of intention to specify the binary presentation versus the interoperable name version, and I just thought this would be a burden going forward for people who are having to specify 7930 addresses.

275
00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:15.159
Premm.eth: And it should be a very easy, interpretation. So, if we move the, interoperable names portion to 7928, 7828,

276
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:24.030
Premm.eth: Then it would be clear that we have a binary specification, and then a more human-readable specification, in the 7828.

277
00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:33.139
Joshua Rudolf: Does that make sense for Angio? Anyone else? I think it's maybe hard to get up to speed with all of this on a call. Maybe we can take the discussion

278
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:37.510
Joshua Rudolf: to the Telegram group, but… Yeah.

279
00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.280
Joshua Rudolf: Okay.

280
00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:49.629
Joshua Rudolf: Anything else to touch on this topic? Orca, Pram, anyone else?

281
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:55.940
Orca 0x: I think that was it. There are a few links.

282
00:36:56.440 --> 00:37:05.080
Orca 0x: Which I'll share in the channel, if anyone does want to follow up. As I said, that was mostly a call for input. And yeah, as Teddy says, the forum, I think, probably is the best place

283
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:12.539
Orca 0x: Going forward. And as I say, we're trying to obviously, as with all these kind of things, balance,

284
00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:20.229
Orca 0x: Balance speed, but obviously also quality, so, we just want to make sure we get that… get that right.

285
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:27.319
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, yeah, thanks, Teddy, for flagging it. Take the discussion to the forum, and we'll try to balance…

286
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.769
Joshua Rudolf: Getting things right with endless, discussion threads?

287
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:41.369
Joshua Rudolf: And yeah, thanks again to Unruggable, Wonderland, Orca, everyone for jumping in. I'm excited to have these released.

288
00:37:41.850 --> 00:37:45.500
Joshua Rudolf: to the public very soon. Interoperable addresses.

289
00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:50.010
Joshua Rudolf: Cool.

290
00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.050
Joshua Rudolf: Okay, so I think we got through…

291
00:37:53.190 --> 00:38:09.669
Joshua Rudolf: what was scheduled on the agenda. One thing that I added as just an opportunity for any open discussion, I'm not sure exactly maybe where this will go, but, for anyone to sort of share their thoughts, I know there's a few folks here who have been thinking quite a bit about this, the topic of,

292
00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:20.129
Joshua Rudolf: full synchronous composability in Ethereum, sort of the value, the urgency, the priority, how should we be thinking about this as an ecosystem, the question of…

293
00:38:20.190 --> 00:38:39.399
Joshua Rudolf: async interop, and does this actually get us most of what we need? Sort of a cost-benefit question here for the ecosystem. Yeah, we of course won't settle this in 20 minutes here, but it'd be great to maybe just get… use this as a opportunity for people to share their thoughts, and maybe we can

294
00:38:40.650 --> 00:38:49.499
Joshua Rudolf: yeah, try to move this question into a more productive, place together. And anyone want to jump in? I know,

295
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:53.759
Joshua Rudolf: Alan, you know, you shared, I think, a really great research

296
00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:56.770
Joshua Rudolf: ETH Research piece on this not too long ago.

297
00:38:56.790 --> 00:39:12.069
Joshua Rudolf: I encourage folks to read that. Maybe if you want to drop the link, or I can find a link to that. Maybe if you want to start with, like, a quick… I don't know if you're able to sort of, like, summarize it in a minute or two, but maybe just sort of, you know, sharing whatever you want in terms of your perspective on…

298
00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:21.150
Joshua Rudolf: On why you're bullish, us, prior to us as an ecosystem, putting much more, resources into synchronous composability.

299
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:37.299
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Hi, everyone. Josh, thank you for having me. Yeah, I would love to kind of open up the discussion. So, I've been thinking a lot about Interop for the past, 6 or 8 months, and obviously we've came along,

300
00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:47.600
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: a great deal of, of work has been done, intense today is, is the kind of the premier framework. But I, I would, I would, maybe, kind of.

301
00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:52.009
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So just thinking about two things. One is,

302
00:39:52.820 --> 00:40:10.670
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: like everything with Ethereum, we kind of, going from the philosophical to the practical, or the engineering, right? So, I would start with the philosophical question. What is exactly Ethereum? Is it Ethereum DL1? Is it Ethereum? The greater Ethereum, as I call it, but basically Ethereum in all of its roll-ups?

303
00:40:10.670 --> 00:40:14.159
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And so on, and I think that the way I… I look at.

304
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.350
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: There's no other tool.

305
00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:20.330
Thomas Clowes | Unruggable - ENS: I'm just gonna leave, but I'm not… Sorry.

306
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:22.240
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So…

307
00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.070
Joshua Rudolf: I think you…

308
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:35.320
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Oh, yeah, okay. So, the way I look at it is, the real power behind Ethereum is its network effects, users' depths, and really the flexibility of what it can do.

309
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:59.319
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And so, I would suggest that, or at least I view it as Ethereum, or the greater Ethereum, meaning that Ethereum DL1 and all of its roll-ups should feel like one big execution environment, meaning that if I'm a user, or if I'm a developer, I shouldn't be experiencing moving between domains as if they're completely separate chains. And I think today, it's very much the case.

310
00:40:59.450 --> 00:41:04.820
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: We've gotten really good at moving, value between

311
00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:21.010
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: chains, not necessarily just even within Ethereum, between Ethereum and even other chains as well, Solana and so on. We got really good at that, but also, we got pretty worse at fragmentation. I think that's a kind of a core question I've been battling with.

312
00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:26.789
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And I don't think intense alone or really fast asynchronous message passing can solve.

313
00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:45.129
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: if the goal, at least for me, is kind of this one unified execution environment where me as a developer, I can do arbitrary read and write, bidirectional arbitrary read and writes between, different roll-ups and Ethereum and roll-ups, and have it in a stateful way.

314
00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:55.310
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I don't think asynchronous message passing or intense bring us to that point, and so that's what kind of piqued my interest in synchronous composability.

315
00:41:55.790 --> 00:42:02.500
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: maybe we can follow up with that, kind of, what it can enable us and so on, but I want to suggest that

316
00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:08.470
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: A lot of it has been done the past two years with synchronous composabilities, so a lot of the, kind of,

317
00:42:08.890 --> 00:42:14.849
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Notions of what it is kind of actually changed the past 2 years, and more specifically, the past 12 months.

318
00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:28.999
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: both research on interop, synchronous composability interop has gotten really good, and also, ZK, VMs gotten to a point where it's actually feasible to do, I think, in a way that is not intrusive.

319
00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.479
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And, and, and, and, and actually, from an engineering point of view and a product point of view, makes, makes sense.

320
00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:41.790
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And so that's kind of how I look at it. yeah, I mean…

321
00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:49.579
Joshua Rudolf: What do you think, Alan, about the sort of the fundamental tensions that Mark from Optimism brought up in the chat around this idea of

322
00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:55.259
Joshua Rudolf: Synchronous composability, the challenge around extending that across governance boundaries.

323
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:55.870
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Yep.

324
00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:07.879
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So, I think that a lot has been done in that area. So, it used to be the case that synchronous composability was imagined or thought of as shared sequencing.

325
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:17.740
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So, in that context, I do believe this is not feasible and not something that we can bring to market. Roll-ups need independent sequencers for many reasons.

326
00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:24.639
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But research and work have been done to actually, not require that anymore.

327
00:43:24.730 --> 00:43:41.799
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So, if you guys are familiar with the Fabric team and their scope framework that they released, I think, around 3 or 4 months ago, which is really, really cool, our work at Compose and others, we don't talk about shared sequencing anymore.

328
00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:52.969
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Everyone has different approaches, but I do think there's a feasible way forward with synchronous composability, which does not require compromising on who runs the sequencer.

329
00:43:53.180 --> 00:44:00.660
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Meaning that roll-ups can have independent sequencers. Furthermore, roll-ups and sequencers of those roll-ups

330
00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:17.399
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: can actually decide, how they manage, interrupt in that sense. So, for example, if you don't want to interrupt with another chain, you can make that decision, and it's a simple config on your sequencer. And so those things came a really long way.

331
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:29.119
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And I think that kind of puts it in a really good place from, again, from an engineering and feasibility point of view, to actually be adopted, because it's much more lightweight than it used to be.

332
00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.910
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: In terms of, kind of, the infrastructure to acquire and so on.

333
00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:40.269
Joshua Rudolf: I have other questions, but does someone else want to jump in here? Either… on either side of the…

334
00:44:40.530 --> 00:44:41.350
Joshua Rudolf: Debate.

335
00:44:48.550 --> 00:44:51.350
Joshua Rudolf: Anyone from… there's a few folks from NOSA's team.

336
00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.459
Joshua Rudolf: Couldn't… I don't know, Sebastian or Frederick, if…

337
00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:11.709
Friederike Ernst: Yeah, so, hi, I'm Friedrika, I'm one of the founders of Gnosis. I'm here for the first time, so, good to see you all. Yes, we were invited to, this group and this call because we've, recently started looking into

338
00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:23.249
Friederike Ernst: Went more seriously, started looking into synchronous composability, with, real-time proving, as a,

339
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.140
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Cool.

340
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:36.149
Friederike Ernst: tenet of that. I 100% agree with Elon that, synchronous composability is where it's at. So, kind of, I… I mean.

341
00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:56.390
Friederike Ernst: we, we are big on intents. We kind of build cow, and so kind of, like, it's… it's not like, I don't, I don't want to dunk on that, but if you, want to, if you want the wider Ethereum ecosystem to feel like one ecosystem and not, a…

342
00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:57.960
Friederike Ernst: fragmented.

343
00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:05.919
Friederike Ernst: federation of different, ecosystems. For instance, if you want to be able to have an identity.

344
00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.310
Friederike Ernst: On, say, a very privacy-respecting

345
00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:19.039
Friederike Ernst: network and, interact with, dApps on other networks without kind of porting all of that over.

346
00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:32.609
Friederike Ernst: I think, I think kind of being able to compose synchronously, so kind of being able to call a smart contract on network A from network B, and vice versa, is

347
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:38.949
Friederike Ernst: Absolutely key, and I think there are different ways of actually getting there. The one that,

348
00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:49.179
Friederike Ernst: we, together with, Jordy from the ZISC team, kind of developed, functions somewhat differently from Elon's, but kind of

349
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:53.809
Friederike Ernst: Ultimately, if… if we end up

350
00:46:53.940 --> 00:47:04.820
Friederike Ernst: getting one of these solutions, I think the ecosystem will be so much better off, because, it's… it's not just about

351
00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:13.580
Friederike Ernst: shared liquidity. Kind of… yeah, we can… I mean, with kind of intense frameworks, you can move

352
00:47:13.810 --> 00:47:20.139
Friederike Ernst: you can move tokens over fairly quickly, you still need liquidity providers and so on, but I mean.

353
00:47:20.450 --> 00:47:28.879
Friederike Ernst: it works, kind of, Kaosoft also works, but for more involved business logic that goes beyond sending tokens.

354
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.550
Friederike Ernst: You need… you need synchronous composability.

355
00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:47.290
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Can you give an example for what use cases or what flows you would have in mind that would, that would actually require synchrony?

356
00:47:47.460 --> 00:47:50.120
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Rather than just composability.

357
00:47:50.460 --> 00:48:05.840
Friederike Ernst: Well, everything where, kind of, you have… where you want one protocol to interact with another protocol, and they're not on the same roll-up, right? So, for instance, if I, if I have, say, Aztec ID on Aztec…

358
00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:18.470
Friederike Ernst: and I want to do something on, say, on ZK Sync, then, kind of, I… I need to be able to, kind of, prove my identity for certain…

359
00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:31.190
Friederike Ernst: for certain use cases, kind of in an atomic transaction in order to do something, and this is only possible if you have synchronicity.

360
00:48:32.810 --> 00:48:33.230
noahpravecek: But I'.

361
00:48:33.230 --> 00:48:46.820
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Why do you care about this being atomic? Why not just send a message via the canonical bridge that takes, let's say, 1 hour to finalize on the L1, and then read it from the second roll-up within 16 minutes?

362
00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:49.480
Friederike Ernst: But that's a terrible user experience.

363
00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.020
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: 60 minutes is forever.

364
00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.000
Friederike Ernst: Yeah.

365
00:48:52.000 --> 00:49:15.600
Friederike Ernst: that's a terrible user experience, so if you just want to do something on another network that requires proving your identity, you don't want to wait for 60 minutes for that. I mean, that's… yeah, I mean, currently people have to do this, and I think, kind of, the one argument that I hear against it is that, kind of, current dApps do not require this, but current dApps do not require this because it doesn't exist.

366
00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:18.120
Friederike Ernst: would be… That's my point.

367
00:49:19.330 --> 00:49:22.270
noahpravecek: But to push back on that, like, for identity in particular.

368
00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:34.560
noahpravecek: if you want to verify identity on-chain, you're doing some form of CKKYC, you're going to need a verifier for that identity. Why can't you just deploy that contract on the other chain that you need to prove your identity on?

369
00:49:36.090 --> 00:49:39.370
Friederike Ernst: Because, kind of, identity is much more than, kind of, just

370
00:49:39.370 --> 00:50:00.359
Friederike Ernst: I mean, identity is also just an example here, right? So, kind of, I go into, kind of, the explanation for the identity, example, but kind of happy to, kind of, give more examples, too. So, kind of, an identity is, in some way, it's a collection of attestations, right? Kind of like, what part of my identity, kind of, I, prove?

371
00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:14.130
Friederike Ernst: to what application should be, should be on me. And, kind of depending on what I do, I might actually have to prove different things, right? Kind of like, I might have to prove, that I'm above 18, I might have to prove…

372
00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:27.939
Friederike Ernst: that I am a citizen of Germany, I might have to prove that I have more than XYZ amount in assets, so I'm an accredited investor, whatever. I mean, there's different, there's different facets.

373
00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:35.310
Friederike Ernst: Of your identity, and it's, to me, very… identity is not a one-size-fits-all.

374
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:37.610
Friederike Ernst: Topic.

375
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:40.829
noahpravecek: Yeah, I get that, but I…

376
00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:41.600
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Guys.

377
00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:49.450
noahpravecek: I've just… I struggle to see a use case for a sync composed build outside of, like, cross-chain flash zones. I've just…

378
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:54.949
noahpravecek: I used to work at a company that its whole point was trying to get synchronous composability, and I…

379
00:50:55.060 --> 00:51:02.570
noahpravecek: adopted. Like, anybody that's been on these calls for a few years can tell you that, like, I was very bullish on synchronous possibility for a really long time.

380
00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:14.380
noahpravecek: and now I'm working on a protocol that's focused primarily on async, and I think, in general, it's just the majority of synchronous composability use cases can be done with async atomic interop.

381
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:19.030
noahpravecek: And as more… privacy-preserving

382
00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:29.129
noahpravecek: tech needs to be adopted in crypto, I think sequence composability also gets harder and harder to adopt, because doing anything at the sequencer level, I think, just becomes more and more difficult.

383
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:34.629
noahpravecek: to get adopted for synchronous composability, because I think, in general, expecting…

384
00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:38.939
noahpravecek: Expecting, like, financial institutions to want to use a shared sequencer, or, like.

385
00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:44.230
noahpravecek: shared structures like that. I think they're just much more concerned on

386
00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.410
noahpravecek: what is… what does settlement actually mean here? What does finality actually mean here? And I think that…

387
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.709
noahpravecek: In general, it's…

388
00:51:51.430 --> 00:52:00.399
noahpravecek: I think shared solo solutions are more likely to get adopted for the long term compared to shared sequencing or synchronous composability solutions.

389
00:52:00.830 --> 00:52:08.880
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But I think we need to get off the table the shared sequencing part, because that's really, you know, a two-year-ago kind of approach.

390
00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:16.470
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: We don't have that anymore. We do have solutions for, kind of, keeping sequencers intact, but what I want to say in terms of

391
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:31.799
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: kind of the use cases which kind of debate always comes about. There's a lot of things we're doing in Ethereum which enable new things to happen. Nobody's asking, no DAP is asking for faster finality. They don't care about it.

392
00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:46.680
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But we still do that. No DAP is asking for post-quantum signatures. They don't really care about it, but we still do that. I think the thing here is that, what is Ethereum exactly? If we require developers to redeploy their apps 30 times on different chains.

393
00:52:46.680 --> 00:53:00.000
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I don't think this is kind of the vision of Ethereum we want, right? If users move between chains, and moving between Ethereum and Solana and Ethereum and Base feels exactly the same thing from a UX point of view.

394
00:53:00.050 --> 00:53:08.409
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I don't think this is Ethereum at all. And in terms of how urgent this is, I would put kind of this as kind of a…

395
00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:28.320
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: a point of reference, right? We're all kind of, you know, a crypto trader is outraged with the tempo and arcs of the world, right? But I think we're missing a big question. Why did they decide, which are, you know, both of them are really hardcore Ethereum projects at the beginning. Why did they decide to do an L1?

396
00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:33.890
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: There's two reasons I can think of. Number one is they want to control their infrastructure.

397
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:43.380
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But, this is also true for the L2. They can still control their infrastructure. The second thing is, in my opinion, is that…

398
00:53:43.470 --> 00:54:00.049
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: spinning up an L2 is as hard as spinning up an L1 today, because when you spin out an L2, you need to recreate an entire ecosystem. You need to convince major dApps to redeploy their daps, you need to convince solvers to connect to you, liquidity providers, and so on. And so…

399
00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:20.559
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: it's not just about what exactly is the use case, it's also about the things it hinders. It hinders L2 advancements, because it's very hard to spin up new L2s. And so, for me, the urgency comes from not necessarily the things that dApp developers are asking or not asking today, it's also from the things we as a community lose.

400
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:32.300
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: the fact that Tempo and ARK are not an L2, in my opinion, is a really big loss for Ethereum. And in my opinion, if we would have had synchronous composability.

401
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:41.089
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: The reasons for them to become an L1 would have been much harder to explain to the board of directors, because the network effect of being out of Ethereum is so strong.

402
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:57.879
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And so that also goes back to the urgency part. I do think it's a philosophical and engineering question we need to ask ourselves. It's not just about who is asking what, because those things are not available right now, and so people don't even know how to ask for that.

403
00:54:58.680 --> 00:54:59.300
Joshua Rudolf: Right.

404
00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:05.680
Lumi | Offchain Labs: I never liked the argument that we're enabling new programming paradigms, and that's why we should have

405
00:55:06.010 --> 00:55:21.420
Lumi | Offchain Labs: synchronous composability. The only answer anyone can ever give me of why we really need synchronous composability is flash loans, and even that you can do asynchronously. Like, the examples that you point out in this ETH research post where people give, like.

406
00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:42.109
Lumi | Offchain Labs: needing to deploy the same dApps over and over again on chains, well, they probably shouldn't do that, right? You don't need a Uniswap on every single protocol if you're able to do cross-chain swaps well and cheaply, right? So not every L2 should be a copy of every other L2. You can start having, like, more specialized L2s.

407
00:55:42.110 --> 00:55:48.710
Lumi | Offchain Labs: So I'm not… I'm not throwing a big bone in this. If we solve, like, synchronous composability in a way that scales.

408
00:55:48.710 --> 00:56:00.999
Lumi | Offchain Labs: Which is the real question. Most, like, no distributed computer system I know of in real life is synchronous. Like, the internet didn't scale like that. No other network scaled to mass

409
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:19.510
Lumi | Offchain Labs: So I think the real question is scale. The application can absolutely be developed asynchronously, and not every change should be a copy of every other chain. Like, you have deep liquidity chains like Arbitrum that it makes more sense to swap on than your random new L2.

410
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:20.319
Friederike Ernst: What do you…

411
00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:21.030
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So, I would…

412
00:56:21.030 --> 00:56:22.130
Friederike Ernst: Think… sorry.

413
00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:34.100
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So I would say that almost every BFT protocol we have is at some point synchronous in times where it's kind of a happy flow, and partially synchronous in other times.

414
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:37.099
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Synchronous composability does not require

415
00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:49.279
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: synchronicity between chains. They do not require the same block production, the same sequencer, or even matching up when blocks are produced, or CK proofs for those blocks are produced.

416
00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:59.010
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: We've moved past those points. We do have the research and kind of engineering behind to decouple those things and make it, in my opinion, scalable.

417
00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:02.459
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Going back to the point of dApp developers.

418
00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:24.479
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But that's kind of the reality of the thing. Dapp developers are redeploying their dApps a million times over, fragmenting their user base, popping up their ops expenses and complexities. That's not because they want to, it's because for them, in order to touch individual domains, they have to redeploy their dApps, because each chain is its own thing. They're not part of Ethereum.

419
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:34.549
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: They're settled on Ethereum, but they don't feel as part of Ethereum. And so I think that, and also goes back to the question of, you know, how many roll-ups do we want, how much competition we want?

420
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:44.869
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I think it's not just about flash loans, it's about everything. Why do we need an interrupt vision where it's basically based on intermediaries?

421
00:57:44.870 --> 00:57:57.359
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: and liquidity. It kind of goes against what Ethereum tries to be. Are we actually saying that the future of Interop is solvers and liquidity for the top 4 or 5

422
00:57:57.530 --> 00:58:04.659
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Tokens? What if I'm token number 50 on CMC, or token number 100? Who will provide liquidity for me?

423
00:58:04.740 --> 00:58:22.120
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So I'm not part of the L2 vision. I mean, it's very problematic. And again, I'm not dunking on anything. I think interrupt with intense is extremely important. There's things you cannot do with synchronous composability, but it's equally important to recognize that there's things you cannot do with intense.

424
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:36.840
Friederike Ernst: like calling a smart contract from another smart contract on a different network. I mean, if you, kind of, if you look at, the ways that DApps today interact on the same network, if… I mean.

425
00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:46.550
Friederike Ernst: if they couldn't do that in the same block, I mean, you'd lose so much. So, and I think, kind of, we're losing

426
00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:52.869
Friederike Ernst: out on that in, in the wider Ethereum ecosystem between different L2s.

427
00:58:54.690 --> 00:59:02.009
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Well, you don't need synchrony for that. Like, you can… of course, there's things that you can't do with intents, and you can have…

428
00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:07.539
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Asynchronous, at an arbitrarily fast, down to real time.

429
00:59:07.790 --> 00:59:10.590
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Composability, and have all of that.

430
00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:13.550
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): And it's well easier to actually.

431
00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:15.280
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Yeah, but, but, but, but, so…

432
00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:27.140
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: So I would argue that a really, really fast, I think, is as complicated as synchronous composability, without atomicity guarantees, and without the bi-directional

433
00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:40.470
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: optionality of it, meaning that each step is its own thing. It's very hard to compose things when each step is… has its own latency, inclusion time, and so on and so forth. And so…

434
00:59:40.590 --> 00:59:59.789
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: again, I think it goes… for me, it goes back to the question, are roll-ups part of Ethereum, or their own chains? Asynchronous… really fast asynchronous composability is equally viable between Ethereum and Solana. So, is there no difference between a roll-up on Ethereum and Solana, or any other…

435
00:59:59.940 --> 01:00:02.679
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): It's not equally viable, because you're

436
01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:15.379
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): trust-minimized bridging between a rollup and Ethereum L1, whereas you stand no chance of having trust-minimized bridging between a non-roll-up and the L1.

437
01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:29.479
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But if you're routing all of your messages through the L1, through Ethereum, you will have really high latency. And so you either choose real-time asynchronous message passing, which is not passed through the L1, and so you do have some trust assumptions.

438
01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:35.700
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: or you press it through the L1, and then you have, for the very least, 12-second latency between messages today.

439
01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:43.200
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Or 6 message… 6-second message latency in the future, hopefully, when we shorten, the, the slow times.

440
01:00:44.090 --> 01:00:45.200
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: You won't, you won't…

441
01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.110
noahpravecek: You don't have long latency, though.

442
01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:53.790
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): ML2, you don't need to wait. Like, it's… Sorry? Sync versus async is merely about the DevEx.

443
01:00:54.090 --> 01:00:56.669
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Like, it's better Devix for synchrony.

444
01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:15.939
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): Right? But if you are able to ZK prove an L2 in 6 seconds on average, you can go instantly. The L2 just needs to react together with the L1 to be able to have a view that's current into the L1. Like, these are orthogonal questions, let's not confuse the different dimensions.

445
01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:22.450
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: No, but it's not exactly the same, because if you want to have ZK proofs, you need to settle them. It's not just enough to have a ZK proof of something.

446
01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:29.610
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Especially in the way roll-ups are built today. You have to settle them first in order to have that finality you want.

447
01:01:30.070 --> 01:01:41.670
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): No, no, no, you need to be able to create a proof that's gonna cost sufficiently little gas on the L1 that you'd be able to afford posting it on every block.

448
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:47.690
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I agree, but then you're tying yourself with latency of the L1, and again, every message is…

449
01:01:47.840 --> 01:02:04.229
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But that's a really big thing. Like, if you need to… every message to wait 6 seconds, it's really a lot of time. And that's thing number one. Thing number two is, not a single contract today on Ethereum is built for asynchronous message passing. All of them are built for synchronous…

450
01:02:04.230 --> 01:02:08.279
Orest Tarasiuk (t1): That's a possibility. Advantage, yes.

451
01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:21.760
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Yeah, but that's part of the single execution, right, for Ethereum. Is Ethereum one big thing or not? And so, I'm not… again, I'm not against asynchronous matches passing. I think there's a lot of value to it in specific things.

452
01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:28.649
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Interop is not one solution. As anything in life, you probably need a tiered system to solve interop.

453
01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:37.900
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: But I think that it goes beyond what we're trying to focus here on use cases, flash loans, not flash loans. It's about DevEx and UX.

454
01:02:38.370 --> 01:02:54.569
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: what exactly are the story we're telling for our users? When they move between Arbitrum and Base, are they moving between two different chains, or they're moving between two domains within an Ethereum ecosystem? That's a really important philosophical question to ask.

455
01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.200
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And I think that, again, I… I'm going back to the example I gave before, 10-point arc.

456
01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:20.819
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I think those are cautionary tales we need to take into consideration, because it's very hard to launch an L2, and so the difference between launching an L1 and an L2 is very minimal today. And the reason why is because there is no composability to speak on, in the sense that if I'm launching an L2, I'm alone, I'm an island.

457
01:03:20.970 --> 01:03:29.569
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And it shouldn't be the case. And so it goes back to UX, DevEx, L2, innovation, and competitors.

458
01:03:30.090 --> 01:03:36.230
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: how contracts interact with other contracts. All of those things speak synchronous compulability.

459
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:40.109
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And I do urge everyone to kind of

460
01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:48.980
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: I know it's a lot of time, but sequence composability came a really long way since, you know, two years ago, or even 1 year ago.

461
01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:57.470
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: And so, not all of those assumptions are correct anymore. I think that we simplified a lot of different things, and we're continuing to simplify things.

462
01:03:57.470 --> 01:04:14.640
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Even to… even, like, the past week, we internally found a way to move assets without wrapping them. So, for example, moving USDC between roll-ups without wrapping it, using really interesting, kind of, liquidity provisions on a bunch of roll-ups, and because you have atomicity, you can do that. Without atomicity, you cannot.

463
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.679
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Things are improving all the time.

464
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:25.829
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: kind of my kind of thing that I wanted to kind of do is to make everyone aware of the advancements, and also

465
01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:33.770
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Allocate time and resources to continue developing it, because this, in my opinion, this is a really important

466
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:37.399
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: component of future Ethereum we should, we should kind of consider.

467
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:46.669
Joshua Rudolf: So we're running out of time here. I think this is a great discussion. I would love to continue it.

468
01:04:46.820 --> 01:05:04.500
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, I think there's no question that this is worth more investment, exploration, discussion. I agree with Alan, your earlier point, that interop is almost certainly sort of a multi-tiered, or require a multi-tiered solution. There's not going to be a single thing that comes in as a silver bullet that magically solves Interop for Ethereum.

469
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:07.699
Joshua Rudolf: Maybe, but I haven't seen it yet.

470
01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:20.159
Joshua Rudolf: And, yes, to me, there's no question that we need to better, yeah, continue to explore things here, so I'm very grateful to have you and everyone else on this call that is pushing us in this direction. I think we should keep pushing here.

471
01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:34.240
Joshua Rudolf: And I think we need to maybe continue to better, at least from my perspective, better define the things that are really, truly only possible, in this synchronous world. And it's, like, it goes into this sort of broader philosophical and…

472
01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:43.030
Joshua Rudolf: prioritization, I think this is kind of where it starts to get a little bit messy of a conversation, but, I would love to continue the conversation, so…

473
01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.539
Joshua Rudolf: Yeah, let's do it.

474
01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.689
Joshua Rudolf: Any, any other quick final thoughts?

475
01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.460
Joshua Rudolf: Otherwise, we can end it there.

476
01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:59.520
Joshua Rudolf: Awesome. Okay, well, thanks so much, thanks for the new people joining, and yeah, we'll see you all on the next call.

477
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:01.480
noahpravecek: Thanks.

478
01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:02.780
Alon Muroch | SSVLabs: Thank you.

479
01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:03.890
Joshua Rudolf: Bye, guys. Bye.

480
01:06:04.310 --> 01:06:04.700
John Church: Thank you, everyone.

481
01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.270
Anjan (Avail): Thank you, bye-bye.

482
01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:08.470
Premm.eth: Bye.
